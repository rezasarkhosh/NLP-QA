guysüòâ without ado let‚Äôs dive right main content short believe bitcoin positioned price increase i‚Äôll explain outlook three key arguments starting first one ‚úÖ reason 1 i‚Äôve applied bollinger bands bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart currently price rebounding touching lower band support resistance often occur upper lower bands bollinger bands case price first hit upper band followed touch lower band‚Äîtypically precursor rebound let‚Äôs verify historical examples ‚úîÔ∏è example 1 chart january 2024 time price followed similar pattern first hitting upper band touching lower band following price rebounded sharply eventually hit new alltime high ‚úîÔ∏è example 2 take look chart february 2023 price touched upper band followed lower band saw four consecutive green candles afterward leading significant rally ‚úîÔ∏è example 3 chart february 2022 despite prevailing downtrend witnessed technical bounce price touched upper band dropped lower band significant rebound followed even midst bearish market conditions let‚Äôs shift back current chart ‚úÖ reason 2 next lets take look rising channel formed three critical points find channel quite interesting focusing half line consistently provided clear support resistance levels recently saw price rejected channel reinforces reliability however price currently broken channel manages rebound reenter could witness significant upward movement pattern commonly referred trap frequent occurrence technical analysis ‚úîÔ∏è example 1 chart december 2023 rising channel based three key points sharp drop price broke channel quickly recovered forming trap pattern rising opposite end channel ‚úîÔ∏è example 2 take look chart march 2024 see rising channel formed three key points ten consecutive green candles price hit peak dropped despite breaking channel price quickly recovered forming another trap pattern continued rise holding middle line channel ‚úîÔ∏è example 3 here‚Äôs chart november 2023 rising channel formed connecting lower trendline peak price drop price broke lower trendline forcing many retail investors exit positions however price soon rebounded eventually broke channel upside time trap pattern appeared twice triggering multiple exits market ‚úÖ reason 3 third reason involves 3 market phases pattern pattern typically unfolds three distinct stages contraction expansion profit taking first contraction occurs stabilizes price range makes investors feel comfortable next expansion phase kicks causing volatility confusion often leading investors get stopped finally profit taking phase occurs sparking fomo fear missing sentiment among investors price moves rapidly pattern often leveraged market manipulators shake retail investors larger price movement let‚Äôs take look past examples see action ‚úîÔ∏è example 1 here‚Äôs chart january 2024 showcases textbook example 3 market phases contraction stabilized price range expansion created volatility confusion profit taking resulted strong uptrend ‚úîÔ∏è example 2 here‚Äôs chart june 2023 see classic case 3 market phases pattern expansion phase price breached upper lower bounds forcing retail investors stop followed strong directional trend ‚úÖ first
