My fellow traders, here we have a classic bearish chart setup.

‚ûñ Bitcoin has been consolidation with a bearish bias now for six months straight; it has been printing lower highs.

‚ûñ Volume has been dominant on the bearish side and the BTC side of the Altcoins market is decidedly bullish. These signals are telling us that Bitcoin is likely to move down next; another leg down.

‚ûñ This move can develop within the next 3-14 days, thus making this a timing trade. Potentially, a "great entry timing."

I am wishing you profits and good luck.

The only reason why people liked Bitcoin is that it went exponentially up from 2009 to 2017 and made a lot of new millionaires. The price in 2017 was 20,000 USD per Bitcoin, the current price is 58,900, and I predict Bitcoin to hit 28k next year! So after 8 years of struggling, bitcoin is going nowhere. The soon you understand the fact that Bitcoin will never go exponentially up again, you will start making money. And really forget about altcoins, I predict ETH to hit 700 USD next year as well. Why is that? Why is crypto dead, and will it recover?

The answer is no, it will not recover. The reason is that the overall hype ended and the bubble really popped. New scientific research shows that this crypto technology is actually even worse than the FED's fiat model of unbacked currencies with their money printer. And yes, all central banks in the world belong to the FED. With this technology, they can make a one-world digital currency (Bitcoin - CBDC) with a total control model. Every transaction is tracked on the blockchain, 1 wallet per person, public wallet blacklists, maximum spendings, etc. If FED introduces you to a new currency called Bitcoin, you will probably dislike it immediately, so what about create Bitcoin secretly?¬†

This crypto technology is not new at all, it was brought to earth by weird alien races from other star systems and galaxies. They cooperate with FED and the unfriendly Galactic Federation for a long time.

A lot of people still think that Bitcoin is here to destroy banks. This is completely false, banks do not really care what currency they use. The main purpose of banks is to provide financial services and to keep your money saved. Yes, you can go to banks and get a loan, you will get 100,000 USD, but you need to pay 200,000 USD. That's a good business, isn't it? And it really doesn't matter if the loan is in US dollars, Bitcoins, gold, or silver. Banks provide over 100 different services, and they make money on them. So no, Bitcoin has nothing to do with destroying banks! Bitcoin is really not good as presented, it's the opposite.

Btw, the real story behind the Titanic Boat is to get rid of people who were against the creation of the FED. They were unable to create the federal reserve system because they did not have enough votes. Rothschilds and J.P. Morgan built the "unsincable" Titanic and invited the most influential people so they could get rid of them in the middle of the ocean. They killed over 1500 powerful people, and it was on 15 April 1912. The FED was created afterwards on 23. December 1913.
‚û°Ô∏èBitcoin is heading for a massive bear market in 2024/2025! If you are new to crypto, you may miss information about usual Bitcoin volatility; precisely, Bitcoin crashes by 80% - 90% every 3rd year. Of course this is not natural, it's caused by tremendous manipulation by Cabal (banks, governments, world's organizations (WEF, WHO, etc...). They all work together while giving you an illusion. Of course their goal is to enslave humans with nanotechnologies, artificial intelligence, a neurolink from Elon Musk (that will be connected to your brain), a credit score system, and 1 world digital currency (Bitcoin), forced jabs, etc... All these technologies are completely incompatible with the human body and cause massive depression, anxiety and cancer. In today's world, we can already see how many people are in a depression state by these technologies.

‚û°Ô∏èThey will not tell you that every human naturally possesses strong abilities, such as Telekinesis (move objects with your mind) or Telepathy (you don't really need to use your phone to communicate over long distances). There are natural abilities that every human can do without exception. And I don't want to talk about magic powers, leaving your physical body during sleep (astral travel) or meditation, maybe in the next post. These are abilities the Cabal doesn't want you to use.

‚û°Ô∏èOn the weekly chart, we can see that Bitcoin is heading downward, I expect 28k to be hit in 2025. Of course markets move in waves, and we have many minor levels on the way down. We have the 100 and 200 weekly moving averages at the same place, 0.382 FIB retracement, fair value gaps, and 0.618 FIB retracement. I will keep you updated once we reach these important levels!
BINANCE:BTCUSDT  is strengthening after a false breakdown of the 54.5K - 55K support. Fundamentally and technically, there is no buyer motivation. Traders have moved into the waiting or selling phase...

  

Now BTC is accumulated mainly by wallets with balance < 1BTC... Larger wallets are not doing much. Also, judging by the statistics of various services it can be seen that the trading activity of large investors has decreased, and whales have stopped actively accumulating since August. Traders doubt the current rebound in BTC and continue to actively short it.
Technically, the coin shows negative, bearish dynamics, forming gradually declining highs without the possibility to approach the retest of local peaks.
For the last one and a half or two months a tight sideways range has been formed and MM continues to keep the price inside the flat, it is also worth paying attention to the descending resistance, which also prevents the market from going up, putting pressure together with SMA-200.

 Resistance Levels: SMA200, 59600, Trend Line
Support levels: 57736, 56K, 54500 

At the moment the price is consolidating in the bullish zone, which indicates a possible chance to rise to 59600. The situation may end with a short-squeeze and further decline after liquidity capture. The pressure from sellers continues and buyers are not ready yet

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:BTCUSD   ;)

Hello Traders! 
What are your thoughts on BITCOIN ?
Bitcoin has been in an upward trend in recent days, showing significant strength. However, the price is now approaching a key resistance zone that could potentially lead to a temporary correction.
Given this resistance, we anticipate a correction in this area. This correction could present an opportunity for traders to enter the market.
It is recommended that traders closely monitor this resistance zone and wait for the correction to complete before considering entry. Once the correction is over, we expect Bitcoin to resume its upward movement and potentially reach new highs.

Good afternoon my fellow supporter, readers, followers and Cryptocurrency traders, how are you feeling in this wonderful day?

We are going to look at a classic now, everybody on TradingView knows this one; MA200.

‚ûñ When Bitcoin, or any Cryptocurrency for that matter, trades below MA200 on the daily timeframe we consider this bearish long-term.

‚ûñ When the trading is happening above this level, it is considered bullish.

‚ûñ Bitcoin is currently trading below MA200 on the daily timeframe.

‚ûñ MA200 sits right now at exactly $64,000.
‚ûñ Any trading below this level indicates that a long-term bearish bias is in place.

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.
üöÄ #Bitcoin Monthly Chart Update üöÄ

After breaking out from its previous all-time high, #BTC is now retesting that key level.
The current monthly candle looks solid, showing signs of strength! üìä
This could be the beginning of a major move upward, in my opinion. üí°

hello guys.

 Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern:  The chart highlights a clear Inverse Head and Shoulders formation, a well-known bullish reversal pattern. The left shoulder, head, and right shoulder are well-defined, signaling a potential trend reversal from the previous downtrend.

 Breakout Above the Neckline:  The price has broken above the neckline, which confirms the reversal pattern. This is typically a strong bullish signal indicating further upward momentum.

 Engulfing Pattern:  An Engulfing pattern at the right shoulder supports the bullish case, suggesting the buyers are gaining control, pushing the price higher.

 Next Target: The projected target for this breakout is $62,000, which is indicated on the chart. This would be the next key resistance level where traders might take profits or reassess positions. 
 
Pullback Potential:  There is also a possibility of a minor pullback to retest the breakout area (around $58,500), which would act as support before continuing upward.

Hello traders,

Bitcoin price tested 53k support area again and currently is in a correction phase.

I expect BTC price to trade in the range between 53k and 61k before 18th September when the FED expected to cut rates. 
After that event all markets might plunge in the short term but in the long term this should be bullish.
Considering all this, it's highly important for Bitcoin price to hold above the 50k area in the short term before all markets will start to recover.

Will Bitcoin manage to hold a 50k support area is another question but if it fails to do so then we might see BTC reaching 47k or even 42k areas. 
But in any case I don't expect the price to stay at those levels for too long as it is more likely to recover quickly.

Please, do not forget to boost this idea and leave your comments below, thanks.
since we still downtrendling and forming an pennannt now i think its the best to short from the trendline  ..  you could protect probably reqlly fast so its a free ride..   if it breal down. ( what is do expext next week we gonna see 38-42k range probably.  so yeah,, this is how i see it for the next weeks
BINANCE:BTCUSDT  
  Bitcoin price is in the ascending Triangle with means the bitcoin price can react to this situation and breaks the triangle and will go up. and the most important resistance for Btc is currently 61k if the price breaks this resistance, Bitcoin can reach the top of the megaphone. 

 Analysis Summary: 
Current Situation:
Bitcoin is struggling to break the important $61,000 level. This level is crucial for further upward movement.
 Potential Scenarios: 
If Bitcoin successfully surpasses the $61,000 level, it could indicate a bullish trend continuation.
Failure to break this level might lead to a consolidation phase or a potential bearish reversal, especially if it falls below the support level at $51K.
Conclusion:
The chart combines multiple technical analysis tools to provide a comprehensive view of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential price movements. Traders will be watching the $61,000 level closely, as breaking it could signal a strong bullish trend, while failing to do so might lead to a bearish scenario.

üëâ Yesterday I Shared a  BITCOIN Long Position  But I Decided To Close It Atb54800$ By Tiny Profit Because After CPI And PPI I Expected a Strong Move But They Didn‚Äôt Effected Much On The Market And It Means Still Bulls Didn‚Äôt Enter The Game, Let‚Äôs Talk About Current Situation 

 üìâ Clear Corrective Structure Formed At The BTC Chart, We Have a Rising Wedge By The Clear ABC Structure And At 1H Timeframe Strong Bearish Hammer Formed At The Chart, Also At Higher Time Frame There Is Head And Shoulder  

üéØ Totally I Think Still Bearish Scenario Is More Probable And Leg Down To The 49k And 44k Is a Next Move I Expect For The BITCOIN
Bitcoin  is currently moving in the  Support zone($55,780-$54,550)  near the  Support lines  and  100_SMA(4H-TF) .

According to  Elliott's wave theory , Bitcoin is completing  microwave 5 of the main wave 5 .

Also,  Regular Divergence (RD+)  between  Consecutive Valleys .

I expect  Bitcoin  to rise to at least  $59,000  after breaking the  Resistance line .

 Note: We can expect more dumps if Bitcoin breaks the Support zone($55,780-$54,550).

Bitcoin remains in consolidation within a strong descending broadening wedge, recently reaching the wedge bottom as corrective wave leg E completed. 

This signals the potential for a massive impulsive move, making the current buy-back zone ideal for re-accumulation if the opportunity arises. A strong reaction is expected at the external supply zone, but we anticipate a breakout. 

Previous analysis has shown how well price has adhered to this pattern. The road map show it all clearly.


 Let us know if you're feeling bullish or bearish about this setup.
BTC Confirms a Double Top Pattern! What‚Äôs Next?

Bitcoin has recently formed a small double top pattern. The price has already broken down from the neckline, confirming a further decline.

Speculation is high regarding the upcoming FOMC meeting and the potential rate cut they might announce. However, BTC has remained indifferent to these speculations and hasn‚Äôt shown any significant rise in recent days. If this situation persists, BTC may continue to move downwards.

Should this trend continue, BTC could potentially drop further, possibly reaching the  GETTEX:54K  level.

 You may find more details in the chart!
Thank you and Good Luck!

Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Observing the chart, we can see that the price some days ago started to grow inside the upward channel, where it in a short time rose to a resistance level, which coincided with the seller zone. Soon, BTC broke this level and rose to the resistance line of the channel, thereby later exiting from it and then turning around and starting to decline inside the pennant. In this pattern, BTC at once fell to the 61000 level, broke it again, and later continued to decline next to the support level, which coincided with the buyer zone. Later, the price broke this level and fell to the support line of the pennant pattern, after which at once started to move up and soon broke the 56100 level one more time. Next, the price continued to grow and reached the resistance line of the pennant, but recently it rolled down a little below and now trades near this line. So, in my opinion, BTC can correct to support line of pennant and then start to grow to a resistance level, thereby leaving this pattern. When the price reaches the 61000 level, it can break it and then continue to move up. For this case, I set my TP at 63000 points. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ
hello guys.

let's dive into the monthly time frame of btc analysis.


 Breakout Confirmation:  
The candle highlighted in yellow, initially suspected to be a "hunting candle," has not confirmed its status as such. With 6 subsequent candles failing to validate a hunting pattern, it is more likely a breakout candle indicating a continuation of the bullish trend.

 Scenario Probability:
 The more probable scenario suggests a continued upward movement, targeting the next significant resistance level above $72,000.
The scenario where the price touches the lower level (around $42,000) is less likely, given the strong bullish momentum and support levels seen in the recent price action.

According to the  Elliott wave theory , Bitcoin seems to have completed the  Double Three Correction(WXY)  in the  descending channel .

I expect  Bitcoin  to rise to at least the  First Target  and the  width of the broken-descending channel .

 Note: If Bitcoin goes below the Resistance zone($55,720-$54,550), we should expect Bitcoin to dump to $51,000(at least).

Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. By observing the chart, we can see that the price not long ago declined in a downward channel, where it dropped from the resistance line to the seller zone, which coincided with the resistance level. Then the price bounced up and tried to grow, but soon continued to fall. In a short time, BTC declined below the 57900 level, but later turned around and rose to the resistance line of the channel, after which it reversed and fell to the support line of the downward channel. Then the price rose to the 57900 level and even entered the seller zone, after which it dropped to the support level, exiting the downward channel, and soon broke the 54800 level, falling even lower. But after this, Bitcoin turned around and started to grow inside the upward channel, quickly rising to the 54800 level, which coincided with the buyer zone, and broke it again. Next, the price rose to the resistance level of the channel, after which it rolled down. So, in my opinion, BTC can decline a little more and then start to move up to the resistance line of the upward channel, thereby breaking the resistance level. In this case, I set my TP at 59000 points, which coincides with this line. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ
Another support level is lost in the form of EMA34 on the weekly timeframe...

Good Monday my dear reader, how are you feeling today?
Tomorrow we will have really high energy with a super full-Moon; will this be the trigger for the crash?

Bitcoin has been in a downtrend for six months now, fully confirmed and no signs of this pattern ending, in fact, it is being reinforced.

This week starts red and starting red after a weak pull-back is bad news.

What needs to happen for this chart to change from bearish to bullish?
That's irrelevant.

The fact is that Bitcoin is bearish now and moving lower.
It will turn bullish when it turns bullish, at that time we will consider the bullish signals.

For now, focus on the prize, focus on the goal; adapt to market conditions, remove the blinders, don't let assumptions get the best of you, the crash is closer than ever before.

I belief it will be a flash crash... But, who knows!

I don't know if it will flash crash or slow crash, but it is going down and we have some reckoning to do before we can consider bullish growth.

Remember, recovery in late 2024; slow in early 2025 (January-February) and bullish speed in March 2025 and beyond.

Patience is key.

Let the market do its thing.

Everything is good with life.

There are many opportunities around and many Altcoins are good now to support you while Bitcoin goes through its reset.

It might be "painful" short-term, only if you are not prepared.
But long-term, this is good news... We use these challenging moments to become stronger, to grow and evolve; challenges are the stepping stones to success.

You are a Diving living Soul.
You have eternal life.
You are special.

Namaste.
In this analysis I want to take a look at BTC's short-term price action: what can we expect over the next few days?

As seen on the chart, the price is currently slightly reversing from the diagonal purple resistance. It's too early to call for a reversal, but we have to be cautious nevertheless.

On the bottom you can see the RSI indicator flashing overbought. The previous 2 times this occurred it caused a reversal.

This is exactly the same as today: RSI overbought and hitting resistance. This is not a time to be bullish. I'd wait for the price to pierce through the resistance. For aggressive bears, however, this seems like a perfect bearish swing-trade.
It is observed that price is traded within a band (blue channel) forming a pattern known as the bullish flag which is highlighted (green) pole and a trading channel (blue). 
This present a massive opportunity as this chart structure indicates a prospective price rise of about 70%. 
This also aligns with the other fundamentals like the US elections in November as usually market makers will take position before significant events.

The idea is to buy at the lower troughs of the blue channel while expecting a price break-out to about $88,000

ACTION PLAN
50,560-53,770	-- BUY
50,550 -48,659	--WAIT/ DO NOTHING 
BELOW 48,396	--SELL

However, this trade idea gives a risk reward  ratio of 8.9.

Goodluck!!
btc consolidate  descending triangle pattern in 3d chart

in addition to triple bottom (Its completion means confirmation of the bullish)

now we need breakout 61k  (the 0.618 fibo level )

i expect  btc will retest the 68k - 69k soon, remember that RES get weaker each time it's retested.

Bitcoin  moved as I expected in  yesterday's post .

 Bitcoin  is currently moving in the  Resistance zone($60,080-$59,400) , near the  Resistance lines  and the  50_SMA(Daily) .

It also seems that  Bitcoin  can potentially form the  Bearish Crab Harmonic Pattern  and  Bearish Shark Harmonic Pattern .

After breaking the  small   Support zone , I expect  Bitcoin to attack  the  Support zone($58,000-$56,600)  again.

 Note: We can expect more pumps if Bitcoin breaks the Resistance line (over $61,000).

The most terrifying scenario
Away from the chart, markets, resistances and supports
We all know the things that the Middle East is going through from the current conflict and wars
There is a regional war approaching between the Israeli and US teams and the other team, Iran and its allies
What is different this time, according to experts, is that Tel Aviv will completely destroy the world's financial capital
Which includes the headquarters of major trading platforms such as Coinbase, Binance, OKX and others
And many of the super-rich American Jews will provide absolute support to Israel in this war
By selling large assets of digital currencies ..... and many measures that will make this market go through a deadly period
Finally
If you have entered this market with all your money, do not sleep before you set a stop loss
If this scenario comes true, we will see Bitcoin in one candle falling to levels of 20k and perhaps less
And there are alternative currencies that will disappear completely from the market

Bitcoin  started to rise well from near the  Support line  and the  Support zone($55,780-$54,550)  again.

According to  Elliott's wave theory , Bitcoin completed the  main wave 4  with  Zigzag Correction(ABC/5-3-5) .

In terms of  Classic Technical Analysis , Bitcoin has succeeded in breaking the  upper line  of the  Bullish Flag Pattern .

We can also see the  Morning Star Candlestick Pattern , which can be a sign of the completion of  Bitcoin correction  or the  main wave 4 .

I expect  Bitcoin  to break the  Resistance zone($58,000-$56,600)  and  100_SMA(4-hour TF)  in the  coming hours  and rise to at least the  Potential Reversal Zone(PRZ) .

 Note: If Bitcoin goes below the Support zone($55,780-$54,550), we should expect Bitcoin to dump to $51,000(at least).

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. A not long time ago price rebounded from the support level and tried to grow, but after it rose a little higher than the resistance zone, it dropped below the 58300 level, breaking it. Then BTC made a retest of this level and continued to decline to the trend line. After the price fell to this line, it turned around and started to grow inside the upward channel, where it some time rose near the trend line, which support line of the channel and later rebounded up. Bitcoin almost reached the 58300 support level, but then made correction, after which continued to move up. When the price reached the 58300 level, it at once broke it and rose to the resistance line of the channel. But recently price rebounded and made a correction movement to the support level. And now it continues to trades near this level inside the resistance area in an upward channel. In my mind, BTCUSDT will fall to the trend line and then rebound and start to grow to the resistance line of the channel. That's why I set my goal at 60800 points. If you like my analytics you may support me with your like/comment ‚ù§Ô∏è
Short Bitcoin per trendline: 

Entry - 60,200 to 60,500

Stop Loss - 61,200

Targets: 

1) 46,000

2) 39,500

3) 35,000

Clear trendline breakdown with respected areas circled in red! When in doubt zoom out! 

Happy trading
#BTC is currently in an important resistance area of 60,000 - 61,000 . 

Some bearish signs are visible on the chart, as soon as the blue trendline gets broken, market will most probably face intense sell pressure and BTC will probably head for 55,000 zone and then 52,000. Sell strategy is advised!
Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà As per our latest analysis, attached on the chart, BTC has rejected the $50,000 - $52,000 support zone and has been trading higher since then.

As long as the bulls remain in control,  a continuation towards the $61,000 - $62,000 resistance zone is expected.

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

Massive 6% move up today for Bitcoin in anticipation for a 50 bps rate cut tomorrow.

 CRYPTOCAP:BTC  smashed through the 50D MA and back into the BMSB.

However don‚Äôt be fooled; we are still very much in a downtrend as you see the 50MA is well below the 200MA.

We could see price break through the BMSB and reject from the 200MA in the next 48 hours.

There‚Äôs still a lot of liquidity <$50k that needs to be claimed for the next leg up. 

Either way, I would not be trading leverage here. 
Expect massive volatility.
Now bitcoin price is in the ascending Triangle with means the bitcoin price can react to this situation and breaks the triangle and will go up. and the most important resistance for Btc is currently 61k if the price breaks this resistance,  Bitcoin can reach the top of the megaphone.

The markets are always changing and even with all these signals, the market changes tend to be strong and fast!!
As you can see, BTC has created an ascending head and shoulders and , which has just been broken in the 4-hour time frame and this means that the price can be bullish and I expect the price to go up to the  Fibonacci line of 0.618 = 60k .  Stay tuned for more updates, thanks 

BTC From a different point of view !!!



Previous Analysis
On a smaller timeframe, we see yet another good start for a potential rejection to happen near 100EMA. 

So far, sellers seem to take dominance near this zone, which is good for us. 

We are looking here for further pressure from sellers and eventually a further downward movement from here!

Swallow Team
Based on the analysis using the Algoman indicator, Bitcoin is moving within the $56K to  GETTEX:64K  range. Considering the formation of 4-hour order blocks, there is a high probability of a price interaction with the 4-hour order block around the  GETTEX:64K  zone.
BTC has reached to 4h supply zone and i can see Wyckoff.
entry(order limit):57569.63
tp1:55067.63
tp2:54049.95

After Bitcoin retraced nearly 19% from its recent highs, I believe it hasn‚Äôt yet reached the average cycle correction of around 22%, which could take the price down to about $57,500. In a more bearish scenario, the correction could deepen to 25%, or even extend toward $50,000‚Äã.

Factoring in U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, will drive short-term volatility, it is likely that it will lead to market downturns before any stable recovery‚Äã. Even if BTC does put higher and reach near $65,000,the short term upside would be capped as major selling pressure is likely to appear there. This makes the $60,500 level a reasonable point to short with a target of 
 around $59,000 at the 200EMA.
Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. Some days ago price declined to the resistance level, which coincided with the resistance zone, and at once rebounded up to the trend line. After this, BTC turned around and made a strong impulse down, breaking 63900 with 53200 levels, but soon turned around again and rose higher than the 53200 level, making a fake breakout of it. Next, the price started to grow and later it grew almost to a resistance level, where it some time traded. Then the price rose to the resistance zone, where it touched the trend line one more time and then started to decline. In a short time, BTC fell to the support level, which coincided with the support zone, and a not long time ago it rebounded and started to move up. So, in my mind, I expect that BTCUSDT will make little correction movement and continue to grow to the trend line. For this case, I set two goals, first at the - 57400 points, and second at the 60600 points, which coincides with the trend line.

Bitcoin is going to hit $100,000 in 2025... I am going to breakdown how everything will develop in a few minutes.

How are you feeling in this beautiful Saturday/Sunday?

The correction is not yet over. When the correction is over we will have bullish action, of course, but bullish action doesn't mean straight up, it simply means higher highs and higher lows. There will be fluctuations, shakeouts, swings and all types of market moves in-between.

The correction bottom comes in and growth immediately follows for a month or two and then another drop. This drop can end in a higher low or lower low (around November), makes no difference. After this drop we enter the accumulation phase and things will slow down.

While Bitcoin moves slowly, slow and steady growth, these Altcoins that I've been sharing now will have their best period in some 4, 5, 6 years.

December 2024, January and February 2025 Bitcoin will be slow but still higher, moving up, recovering. Full speed starts to develop right after February, at the beginning of March 2025. We can say it will take some time to break resistance, the barriers, and so after March/April 2025 we can see the light and we are now aiming toward $100,000. I don't know if it will hit right on April or May or later down the road, but it will take a while.

In short, Bitcoin is likely to hit $100,000 after March 2025.

All the period before this date the Altcoins will shine. The Altcoins will shine because Bitcoin will be growing slowly, kind of sideways; bullish accumulation/consolidation. It will be obvious that the 2024 corrective phase is a thing of the past and everybody will be preparing for the new All-Time High in the latter part of 2025.

We are likely to get a blow-off top in 2025. Not like 2021 but more like 2017. Remember this.

The numbers are pointing toward 190,000 as the top but we will have to add inflation and God knows about market hype. So it can go to 220,000 if things go great.

If things go bad, for whatever reason, we can peak around 150K.

Sounds good?

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price some time ago rebounded from the resistance level and dropped lower than the support level, which coincided with the support zone. After this, BTC turned around and in a short time rose higher than the 53900 level, breaking it, and then continued to grow to the resistance level. When the price reached this level, it some time traded near it, after which made the correction and later backed up to the 61200 level. Soon, BTC broke this level and then reached a trend line, after which the price turned around and dropped lower 61200 level, breaking it one more time and continuing to decline. Price declined near the trend line to the support zone, after which the price turned around and made an impulse up, breaking the trend line. At the moment, BTC continues to move up, so, I expect that price will continue to move up to 61200 resistance level. For this case, my goal is this level.

BTC is showing signs of an upcoming correction. Bearish indicators suggest a potential pullback, so it's time to prepare for a short trade opportunity. Monitor key support zones and watch for confirmation signals as the market cools down. üìâ #BTC #Bitcoin #CryptoCorrection
Hello all traders!

Today I will focus on the 1-hour chart of BTCUSDT, we can see that the price is currently trading around $58,460. But! there are signs that the price is moving within a clear bullish channel. If the price holds $58,000, I expect the price to rise first to $60,000 and even $60,500 to retest the previous support zone and 34.89 (EMA). After that, we can expect the BTCUSDT price to continue to fall down the price channel again and if that happens the possibility of a breakout will increase as the price has tested the lower price channel at least 4 times before.

The "All Patterns" indicator is a comprehensive tool designed for traders to identify various technical patterns on charts, helping to signal potential market movements. This indicator is a compilation of several algorithms and scripts, including notable ones like "Cup Finder" by LonesomeTheBlue, "Wedge and Flag Finder (Multi - zigzag)" and "Auto Harmonic Patterns - Open Source" by Trendoscope.


 Head and Shoulders (H&S): 
 
 Bearish H&S: Indicates a potential reversal of an uptrend.
 Bullish H&S: Suggests a potential reversal of a downtrend.
 
 Cup Formations: 
 
 Bearish Cup: Typically forms during a downtrend and might indicate a continuation or reversal.
 Bullish Cup: Generally forms during an uptrend, suggesting continuation or reversal.
 
 Harmonic Patterns: 
 
 ABCD, Gartley, Crab, Deep Crab, Bat, Butterfly, Shark, Cypher, 3 Drives, 5-0: These patterns use Fibonacci levels to predict potential price reversals.
 
 Color Coding: 
 
 Green Labels: Indicate bullish patterns, suggesting potential upward movement.
 Red Labels: Denote bearish patterns, indicating potential downward movement.
 Label Indications
Labels appear when a pattern completes, providing a signal for potential market entry or exit. Although these labels suggest a completed pattern, they still require confirmation from additional indicators or volume analysis to validate the potential trade.
üì£Despite the recent decline in Bitcoin's price, "Michael Saylor", a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency market, continues to advocate for holding onto Bitcoin. This comes as some analysts, citing recent US employment data, anticipate a potential interest rate cut by the "Federal Reserve", which could drive up riskier assets like Bitcoin. In this analysis, we will delve into the technical reasons supporting this viewüëáüëáüëá

üî•#Bitcoin / ‚è±Daily Timeframe
üìå#Bitcoin failed to reach above the bearish channel on the weekly timeframe during its previous bull-trend.

üîªSubsequently, it has retested the channel's bottom with the recent decline.

üöÄAs a result, there is potential for growth based on a double bottom pattern and a triple divergence, targeting the channel's upper boundary.

‚úÖThis rally could initiate from the current channel bottom or the support zone of $49,000.00 - $50,096.10.

‚ö†Ô∏èIf it rallies from the channel bottom and reaches the first target of $57,877.90, a pullback to retest the second support zone is likely before a substantial uptrend resumes‚ÄºÔ∏è

üôÖRegardless, a breakout above the first target ($57,877.90), which is a crucial resistance level on the daily timeframe, is essential for the uptrend to continue‚úÖüöÄ

üéØSubsequent targets include:
üöÄTarget 2: $66,755.85
üöÄüöÄTarget 3: $74,537.70

‚ùåThe stop-loss for the bullish scenario is a breakout below the bearish channel and a daily candle close below $49,000.00 on the weekly timeframe.

üîÑIn this case, the trend would shift from bullish to bearish, potentially targeting $41,218.20 and then $34,494.20üëÜüëá

üî•#Bitcoin / ‚è±Monthly Timeframe
üî•Potential for a Significant UptrendüöÄüöÄ

‚úÖOn the monthly chart, #Bitcoin is showing signs of forming a flag pattern, which could signal a substantial price increase. 

‚ÅâÔ∏èHowever, for this bullish scenario to play out, the price needs to break above the flag pattern on the monthly timeframe. 

‚úÖIf this occurs, #Bitcoin could potentially rally to around $155,000üöÄüöÄüéØüí∞
Bitcoin Growth Perspective up to 65K
 
Currently, BTC is consolidating, and preparing for its next significant move. 
The key resistance level at $59,600 is important for Bitcoin to overcome to gain further upside momentum

 Technical Analysis 
59.600 price level has been identified as a significant resistance point. 
Breaking through this zone could signal a strong bullish trend which can push Bitcoin up to 62500 which corresponds to another stronger zone.

Continued interest from institutional investors can provide the necessary capital inflow to push BTC past these resistance levels.

Positive regulatory developments can boost market confidence, aiding in the upward movement of Bitcoin.

Global economic conditions, including inflation rates and monetary policies, will also play a significant role in Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory.

BTC/USDT trade on Friday, September 13, 2024, 

Trade Setup:
Entry Price: 60,308.3 USDT
Profit Level: 60,964.4 USDT (+1.09%)
Stop Level: 60,293.3 USDT (-0.02%)
Risk-Reward Ratio (RR): 43.74


Key Level:
The entry at 60,308.3 USDT is close to the psychologically important 60,000 USDT level, often a strong support/resistance zone in Bitcoin trading. If BTC holds above this level, it reinforces the bullish sentiment.
16:00 uts 0 time, there will be a strong decline, into the zone I have indicated.
Hello everyone, 

This post highlights a series of technical patterns, all converging towards the same target area on Bitcoin. We‚Äôve identified a descending broadening wedge, a cup and handle formation, and another descending broadening formation. 

The alignment of these patterns reinforces our bullish bias on Bitcoin, suggesting that a major upside move is imminent. We believe the potential for a significant rally is stronger now than ever.

 Please share your comments and thoughts on this analysis.
Hello everyone,

Today, I‚Äôve prepared an educational guide on chart patterns, specifically focusing on the Flag Pattern.

This content is designed to be easy for beginners to follow, so I hope you find it engaging and informative. :)

Below is the outline I‚Äôll be using for this post:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Outline 

1. What is a Flag Pattern?
 
  Definition
  Key Components
  Characteristics
 

2. Bullish Flag Pattern
 
 Basic Characteristics
 Examples
 

3. Bearish Flag Pattern
 
 Basic Characteristics
 Examples
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 1. What is a Flag Pattern? 

 1) Definition 
 
 A Flag Pattern forms during a brief consolidation phase after a strong price movement, often signaling the continuation of a trend. It typically appears when prices make a sharp move, either up or down, followed by a period of sideways or slightly counter-trend movement.
 Flag Patterns can occur in both uptrends and downtrends, named for their resemblance to an actual flag. After a strong price move, the market consolidates briefly before continuing in the original trend direction.
 

 2) Key Components 
 
 Flagpole: The initial strong price movement that sets the overall trend direction before the consolidation phase.
 Flag: The consolidation period where prices move sideways or slightly counter to the trend, often forming a rectangle or parallelogram. This phase typically occurs with a decrease in trading volume.
 Breakout: The moment when the price resumes its original trend direction. In an uptrend, this is an upward breakout, and in a downtrend, a downward breakout, confirming the continuation of the trend.
 

 3) Characteristics 
 
 Duration: The Flag Pattern typically lasts longer than the Flagpole but varies depending on the timeframe.
 Volume: Volume usually decreases during the Flag‚Äôs formation and increases once the breakout occurs.
 Reliability: The Flag Pattern is considered a reliable indicator of trend continuation, making it a favorite among traders using trend-based strategies.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 2. Bullish Flag Pattern 

 1) Basic Characteristics 
 
 A Bullish Flag forms after a strong upward price movement, signaling a temporary consolidation phase. During this consolidation, volume typically decreases, suggesting that the market is pausing rather than reversing. After this phase, the price often continues its upward trend, accompanied by an increase in volume. Bullish Flag Patterns also help relieve overbought conditions in technical indicators, providing the market with a chance to prepare for another move up.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 This chart from May 2023 shows a strong Flagpole followed by a long consolidation phase (Flag). The volume then increased as the price broke out, completing the Bullish Flag Pattern.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this chart from March 2021, we see a similar setup: a strong Flagpole, followed by a consolidation phase, leading to a breakout that continued the upward trend.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Bearish Flag Pattern 

 1) Basic Characteristics 
 
 The Bearish Flag Pattern is the inverse of the Bullish Flag. It follows a strong downward move (Flagpole) and is followed by a period of consolidation (Flag) with decreasing volume. Like its bullish counterpart, the Bearish Flag can relieve oversold conditions, leading to a continuation of the downtrend after a breakout.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 This chart from May 2022 displays a Bearish Flag Pattern: a strong downward Flagpole, followed by a Flag consolidation phase. After the consolidation, a breakout occurred, continuing the downtrend.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 This chart from February 2022 also illustrates a strong downward Flagpole, followed by a consolidation phase (Flag), leading to a breakout that completed the Bearish Flag Pattern.
 This guide will help you better understand the Flag Pattern and how it can be used in your trading strategy effectively!
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Conclusion 
 I hope the various Flag Patterns and market analysis techniques covered in this post prove helpful in your investment journey. Chart analysis is not merely a technical skill but also a deeper understanding of market psychology and movement. Flag Patterns, along with other chart patterns, visually reflect the psychological dynamics of the market. Mastering their use can greatly contribute to successful trading.

That being said, the crypto market is inherently unpredictable and fast-moving. While technical analysis is a valuable tool, it‚Äôs important to adopt a comprehensive approach that considers broader market trends and external factors. I encourage you to apply the insights gained from this post with a balanced and cautious perspective when making investment decisions.

New opportunities are constantly emerging, and those who are prepared to seize them will find success. The chart represents the market‚Äôs voice. Listening to it, interpreting it, and making informed decisions based on that interpretation is "the essence" of chart analysis.

I sincerely hope that, through continuous learning and experience, you‚Äôll evolve into a more confident and successful investor.
After breaking the head and shoulders, Bitcoin could not break the important resistance of 61K and this caused the pressure of the bears to increase (the divergence shows this well) and the price decreased. We expect the price to decline until near 57K and after that I expect the price to rise again.

The markets are always changing and even with all these signals, the market changes tend to be strong and fast!!
Now bitcoin price is in the ascending Triangle with means the bitcoin price can react to this situation and breaks the triangle and will go up. and the most important resistance for Btc is currently 61k if the price breaks this resistance, AB=CD.
BTC is attempting to break through resistance of ascending triangle pattern after bouncing off support. Wait for a decisive breakout above the ma 200 to confirm the continuation of the bullish trend . Up we go if we do breakout , also a bullish hidden Divergence (HD+) on MACD which shows Positive Signs for BTC.
The price can increase as much as the measured price movement ( AB=CD ) .
The break out needed for increasing further has not happened but it should happen pretty soon.

üìà The BITCOIN Price Playing Below The Crucial 60600$ Resistance Level And I Expect a Breakout Toward a 68k Area As a Next Main Target, Totally There Is Now Bearish Sign At Both High And Low Timeframes And I Think Correction Is Over And We Wont See New Lows
Get ready, Bitcoin is approaching the 85,000 level soon.
Bitcoin  has recently formed a bullish cup or U-shape pattern on the 1-hour time frame and has successfully broken above the flat top resistance.

Additionally, the RSI  is above 60 at the time of the breakout, providing further confirmation of the strength of the move.
An RSI above 60 indicates that the asset is in a strong bullish phase and that there is still momentum in the upward direction.

The depth of the Cup will be added to the breakout price and will act as a target price for this move.
Based on HEW analysis which took me about a month to complete, we are on wave 5 of wave C of wave 3.

according to this analysis, wave 3 will end at 48800-48400. then wave 4 will begin which is a very deep wave. This correction wave would be as long as 10000-15000 USDT.

BTC's price recently bounced from a strong support zone. A potential Bullish reversal seems in play as the price action has broken the previous Lower High. 

This is the 3rd Bounce from key Monthly Fibonacci levels since the previous massive Bull rally (along with further confluence from key Fibonacci Harmonic levels on the shorter 4HR time frame). 

Bounces from these critical levels may eventually lead to the completion of a massive Bullish flag/Cup & Handle Patterns on the Monthly time frames.

If price breaks the all time high and crosses 74000, the chances of TP2 will increase.
 
Trade Plan

Entry @ 60900
Stop Loss @ 52000
TP1 @ 69800 OR BW 0.8 - 1 RR
TP2 @ 78700 OR Ride further with extra caution

No. of Trades: 2

Move SL to Break Even if TP1 hits.

Here's what SMC tell us:
after a slight dipping to the DP.i (58550) point of interest (POI)
then we ready to see a confirmation signal to buy the dip.
that confirmation would be
1. SCOB: Single Candle OrderBlock
2. Lower Time Frame (5mins) ChoCh: (ChoCh: Change of Character)

Without a confirmation entry, we are not allowed to execute buy position,
and then we have to be patient for price to get to a lower important level,
such as Minor High Liquidity Low (57220) or Minor Extreme POI (56025).

I will update Bitcoin regularly..
Take Care
200EMA is still holding the ground where EMA is not letting the price through. 

Our gameplan here is simple: if we manage to hold this zone until the end of the zone, if we see a rejection happen in 36 hours, then we will see a good downward movement from here. 

But remember, fakeout option is still possible but only if buyers manage to breakout and secure the zone above EMAs.

Swallow Team
Bitcoin is retesting the old range lows as support, for the second day in a row. Bulls want to see this general level hold.

Many expected significant price action during the debate, which did not really happen. Bitcoin is clearly stuck in the mud in this part of the cycle, waiting for the next big move. The longer we trade sideways, the bigger the next move will be.
Referring to te chart, there is buy in signal for BTC for short term, and left the long at 59000.

I'm seeing that the price of bitcoin could explode at any time. However, I'm starting to notice weakness in the bounce so I've taken the opportunity to make a short entry as it hasn't broken strongly above the 4h FVG and only went up for liquidity.

  


Trade management: SL in the wick in case it resumes the upward bias better get out of the way. TP on the swing low.
Risking capital: 0.50%.
RR: 2.7
Headline & Core Inflation 
13:30 (GMT) see's the release of the atest round of inflation data. The results here are pretty black and white high inflation (over 2.6% YOY for Inflation, over 3.2% for Core Inflation) is bad. End of. 

We need inflation t come down so we can cut the rates.

Heres where any predictions get a bit tricky though. Very good inflation data 2% like 2% or under could mean we get a big rate cut (50bps is a 33% chance atm). That would send the market wild. Coming in at 2.6% / 2.5% will give us a 25bps rate cut - which is bullish but might be priced in to some degree.

 Either way, low inflation good. High infation bad. 
 
Inflation Rate (YOY) 
Predicted = 2.6% Priced In
 <2.6% = Bullish 
>2.6% = Bearish

 Core Inflation Rate (YOY) - Inflation data not including food and fuel. 
Predicted = 3.2% Priced In
<3.2% = Bullish
>3.2% = Bearish

 Technicals 
In terms of the charts I'd say thats an ascending triangle.

Nice little series of higher lows being capped by flat resistance at $57.5k.

Usually a bullish set up, but realistically thats not going to mean alot if inflation is 9%.

 Trading Plan 
What we can say though is that the overhead resistance starting at $57.5 is basically toast if we get a good inflation read so If we get a good read go long.

Targets are not clear but after the immediate cluster theres an old support/resistance at $63.7k so maybe target $60k ($59.9k to be safe) and $63.7k incase we blow through it.

Bad inflation = short. It could be bad but still take incramental profit to be safe at support, so $53.5k, $50k and maybe hold a bit back as we could easily sink much lower.

 Prediction  - 2.6% price pumps to $60k area (I hope!)
It‚Äôs going up till under 64275 then going down till 54585 and another buying opportunity in begging of October. but if candle stick breaks 53071 then price just falling down.

Fibonacci retracement levels serve as indispensable tools for evaluating retracement potential and identifying targets

This analytical scheme is most effective in market trends. In a market with an upward trend, the traders' goal is to determine the correction potential and strategically identify entry points for long positions. Conversely, in a downtrend, the focus shifts to evaluating correction potentials and tactically identifying entry points for short positions.

By utilizing Fibonacci levels with precision and insight, traders can navigate market dynamics with greater clarity and strategic foresight.

 Operating rules: 
‚óèIdentify the trend and work according to it
‚óèTo determine the correction potential for uptrend use the grid below up.
‚óèTo determine the correction potential for downtrend use a top-down grid.
‚óèFind Swing High and Swing Low for correct using the tool.

1. For an uptrend, the Fibonacci grid extends from HL to HH.
After breaking the downtrend from LL to HH.

2. For a downtrend, the Fibonacci grid extends from LH to LL.
After breaking the uptrend from HH to LL.

 Settings for corrective movements: 

 0.5 - fair price (equilibrium).
0.62; 0.705; 0.79 - OTE zone (optimal entry into a deal). 

Unlike the standard values, this is a modified version with the highest mathematical expectation of price reversal.
To open a position, we are always interested in the price behavior above or below the 0.5 value. 

The smart money will always look to buy at a discount and sell at a premium.

Therefore, to open a short position we always look at the price above 0.5, which is considered a premium. And to open long positions, we look at the behavior of prices below 0.5, which is considered discount prices.

  
  

The OTE zone is an extended grid that is always in the premium market when you are looking for a short position, or in the discount market when you are looking for a long position. 
These levels act as an area for the optimal entry point.

  
  

 Correction of the upward impulse. 
  

Fibonacci lines themselves do not act as support or resistance levels. It is not relevant to trade only on the basis of them. The price turns from specific areas that are displayed on the chart.

 Correction of the upward impulse. 
  

The price may go beyond OTE, this does not negate the relevance of the setup, HL is still being formed in the discount market.

 Correction of the upward impulse. 
  

Not in all cases, the price corrects to the OTE zone: when it reaches the support zone at the 50% level (equilibrium) or slightly below it, a reversal may already begin, because this moment already implies the start of buying or selling with smart money.

 Downward impulse correction. 
  

Make it a rule to open positions only after a correction in the premium or discount market, and skip other opportunities.

The crypto-linked equities industry represents a growing segment of the financial market, offering investors exposure to companies that are directly or indirectly involved in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These equities typically include crypto mining firms, blockchain infrastructure providers, and companies with significant holdings in digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. As the broader cryptocurrency market experiences volatility, these stocks tend to exhibit similar price fluctuations, presenting both opportunities and risks. When comparing these equities, it's essential to consider factors such as their correlation to cryptocurrency prices, regulatory impacts, and the underlying company's financial health and growth potential. The industry continues to evolve rapidly, providing dynamic investment opportunities aligned with the future of digital finance.

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Please click "Boost" as well.
Have a good day today.

-------------------------------------

When you start studying charts, the first thing you learn is about candles.

However, you start studying about the Open, Close, High, and Low of candles.

When you start studying about the Moving Average, you start to think that you understand the charts.

However, when you actually start trading with the Moving Average, you realize that nothing works properly.

So, you start studying other indicators.

-
The above is based on my experience. When you study various charts, you may think you know them, but when you actually start trading, you realize that they don't apply at all.

Where on earth did I go wrong?... What I learned after a long time is that I was wrong from the very beginning.

-
In other words, I realized that my subsequent chart studies were not done properly because I lacked understanding of candles.

When you start studying candles, you study candles of various shapes and patterns.

At this time, you should not be too obsessed with the names of candle shapes or patterns or the conditions that occur and try to memorize them.

It is important to read it repeatedly several times until you can grasp the concept of the arrangements formed by the combination of candle shapes or patterns, that is, the support and resistance points.

Eventually, when the candle shapes or patterns are combined, you can find the volume profile section formed around it, that is, the section where trading volume occurs.

By drawing and marking the support and resistance points you find in this way on 1M, 1W, and 1D charts, you can create a trading strategy on the charts you mainly trade.

That's all the experts in chart analysis say.

In the end, everything is about looking at the combination of candles that make up the chart, finding the corresponding support and resistance points, and trading according to your trading strategy.

A trading strategy is to create a response strategy at the corresponding support and resistance points based on the three things above:
1. Investment period
2. Investment size
3. Trading method and profit realization method

However, since most books do not include trading strategies, you will only learn about the timing of trading and closing of trading using various indicators.

Because of this, there are many cases where you cannot respond to the volatility that occurs after starting trading and end up losing money.

Even so, it is difficult to specifically define the contents of trading strategies.

This is because the investment period, investment size, and trading method are different depending on the individual's investment style.

Therefore, what I can tell you is that you need to set the buy, sell, and stop loss points according to the support and resistance points obtained through chart analysis and wait for a while.

Due to price volatility, you may not touch the buy, sell, and stop loss points or may move past them.

You should learn how to create a trading strategy by modifying the way you respond to these things according to your investment style.

-
One important thing here is that you should mark the support and resistance points in advance through chart analysis before starting trading.

Otherwise, if you start trading and then mark support and resistance points, psychological factors will come into play, which will likely lead to an unexpected transaction.

Don't forget this, and you should practice marking support and resistance points in advance before starting a transaction.

Also, you should avoid analyzing charts after listening to various articles, news, or community content.

The reason is that psychological factors can come into play.

-
I think trading is a response to the movement of prices that fluctuate in real time.

Therefore, waiting and determination are necessary.

If you wait too long or do not make a decision and pass it by, there is a high possibility that you will suffer losses or make little profit, so you need something to refer to when waiting or making a decision.

That is the support and resistance points I mentioned above.

-
However, support and resistance points alone do not solve everything.

Therefore, you should add trend lines and various indicators to ask for a method of responding to price fluctuations.

However, since the trend line is formed by a diagonal line, there is a lack of countermeasure strategies using the trend line.

Therefore, the trend line is used to literally find out what the current trend is.

-
Therefore, when it deviates from the trend line, the movement at the support and resistance points is checked and the corresponding response is made.

When trading with a chart consisting of the above two support and resistance points or only the trend line, there are often cases where the transaction cannot be properly conducted due to fakes or sweeps.

Therefore, in order to counter these fakes or sweeps, various indicators are added to the chart.

The most commonly used of these is the price moving average.

Even if you add the price moving average, you realize that it is a curve, just like the trend line, and is therefore not suitable for countermeasure strategies.

So, the price moving average is also used to check the trend, just like the trend line.

-
In that regard, the indicator I recommend is the StochRSI indicator.

The default settings for the StochRSI indicator are 14, 7, 3, 3 (RSI, Stoch, K, D).

The value of the Signal line (EMA) of the StochRSI indicator is 7.

If the StochRSI indicator rises in the oversold zone and maintains the state of StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, it is a buying period.

On the other hand, if the StochRSI indicator falls in the overbought zone and maintains the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, it is a selling period.

However, you should trade depending on whether there is support or resistance at the support and resistance points formed at that location.

Even if there is movement in the StochRSI indicator, it is recommended not to trade if you do not have support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

The reason is that you may feel psychologically anxious, so there is a possibility that the trade will proceed incorrectly.

-
If you can trade with only what I mentioned above and make an average profit, it is because you have established a trading strategy according to your investment style.

-
We need objective information to establish a trading strategy according to your investment style.

We think that this is the only way to minimize the psychological factors that arise when starting a trade.

If you can add various indicators to the chart to obtain objective information and receive support and resistance point information according to them, you can create a trading strategy according to them at any time.

To do this, we used the StochRSI, OBV, CCI, and RSI indicators to display support and resistance points on the price candle part.

And, we added the StochRSI and BW indicators as auxiliary indicators.

The StochRSI indicator added as an auxiliary indicator is not the StochRSI indicator provided by default, but an indicator with a modified formula, so you can share the chart and use it or copy and paste the TS-BW UP indicator to your own chart and use it.

There is no problem using the basic StochRSI indicator.

However, there is a slight difference from what I said, so there may be a slight problem in understanding.

-
As above, since the support and resistance points of the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts are drawn on the chart to create a trading strategy, my chart is very confusing and not easy to understand when you first look at it.


And, since there are many indicators that I have not explained, it may be even more difficult to see the chart.

Therefore, to resolve the difficult parts, share the chart, hide the indicators added to the chart, and activate them one by one while looking at them, and you will be able to understand the chart.

If you share the chart, you can use it normally, so you can check the chart from various angles.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

BTC has corrected healthily to -20% from its peak after reaching its parabolic ATH highs of 73k.

Now the mother of all of coins is showing some strength again. Weekly data metrics is shifting now and buyers are back again, positioning aggressively for the next RUN-UP to ATH and beyond.

From our weekly chart diagram above, you can observe that the black bear cells has faded and the white dot (longs) has literally escaped the shorts prison cell (black cell). This signal has never  missed since the 15k BTC season. The batting average of this one playing out again is very very high.

This week is the best time to SEED. Get them all planted now. BTC is already up by 10% after that quick bounce from the strong major order support at 57k area. Signs of what's coming next after this week.

Spotted at 60k area.

TAYOR.
Based on the analysis of price action and the identified supply and demand zones, BTC/USDT appears to be at a critical juncture with the 50% retracement level acting as a significant resistance. If the price fails to break through this level and encounters selling pressure, a fall towards lower levels is plausible. It is crucial for traders to keep an eye on the behavior around the lower demand zones to gauge the strength of the potential reversal or continuation of the downward trend.
**Trade Setup for BTC/USDT (1D, Binance)**

- **Trade Type:** Short  
- **Entry Zone:** $60,300 - $65,300 (Supply Zone)  
- **Target:** $41,860 (Liquidity Area)  
- **Stop Loss:** Above $65,300

**Rationale:**  
- The price is approaching a key supply zone where a reversal due to selling pressure is expected.  
- Price action is in a bearish structure, with the potential to make a lower low targeting the liquidity area below $42,000.  
- There‚Äôs a liquidity pool at $41,860, which could be the final target after trapping long positions.  
- Stop-loss is placed above the supply zone to limit risk in case the price breaks higher.

Hello everyone!

Bitcoin is currently displaying the  '3 Market Phases,'  and we‚Äôre transitioning from Contraction into Expansion. As long as the price holds above the lower boundary of the horizontal channel, I believe there‚Äôs a strong likelihood of continued upward momentum.



 Key points: 
 
 Break below the channel:  A breakdown could signal the beginning of a significant downtrend. However, if the channel holds, the uptrend is expected to persist.
 Uptrend continuation:  There‚Äôs a solid chance we could see a rise toward the 63K level.
 

 
  This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
  It reflects a personal viewpoint and is intended for reference only.
  All decisions and responsibilities lie solely with you.
üåüMy analysis is that the future of #Bitcoin looks very exciting. Several big analysts and experts are working on this issue, and each of them says something different. Some, like Peter Brandt, think #Bitcoin might go down a little more, but others like Axel Adler are hopeful that its price will go up a lot.

üåüOn the other hand, big companies like MicroStrategy are buying #Bitcoin. This means that experienced and wealthy people think Bitcoin has a good future. The way Erik Voorhees and Max Keiser see it, Bitcoin can be a good alternative to the dollar and its value can increase significantly.

üåüBut there are also some things to pay attention to. For example, the Relative Strength Index of #Bitcoin shows that its price may rise very quickly and then fall suddenly. This means that the #Bitcoin market is still very volatile and we need to be careful.

üëÄLet's take a look at the chart and see what it tells usüëáüëá

üíéDaily #Bitcoin Analysis

ü§ØYesterday's surge (September 13th) propelled #Bitcoin above its most significant resistance level at 57,877.90. This breakthrough significantly enhances the likelihood of further bullish momentumüöÄüöÄüöÄ

üéØ‚úÖHaving breached this resistance, #Bitcoin is poised to extend its rally within its expanded structure, targeting:

üöÄTarget 1: 62,577.59-63,002.85
üöÄüöÄTarget 2: 66,755.85
üöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 3: 74,537.70
üëâPlease note that these targets are precise, not approximate

‚ùåStop-Loss for the Bullish Scenario and Potential Temporary Dip:

üî¥If the 57,877.90 support level is breached on the daily timeframe before reaching the subsequent bull-targets, #Bitcoin may enter a temporary bearish phase, potentially retesting the following support levels:

üîª51,676.75-52,489.40
üîªüîª48,483.55-50,096.10
üíéüöÄThese support levels are sufficiently robust to potentially reinitiate an bull-trend.

‚ùå‚ùåHowever, if a weekly candle closes below 49,000 due to a bearish move, #Bitcoin could enter a deeper and more prolonged bearish phase. In such a scenario, a long-term analysis update will be providedüîÑ

..................................
üíé#Bitcoin Analysis: ‚è±1-Hour Timeframe

üìàüìâTo encapsulate #Bitcoin's recent bullish momentum within a structured framework, we can overlay both a smaller and a larger bullish channel (refer to the attached chart).

üöÄThese channels serve as guiding lines for the bull-trend, providing a solid foundation for crafting growth scenariosüëá

‚úÖ‚úÖStrong Growth Scenario: As long as #Bitcoin remains confined within the smaller (more recent) bullish channel, there is a high probability of continued bullish movement with strong momentum.

üöÄThe support levels within this channel act as potential launchpads for renewed growth toward our primary price targets. These support levels include: the mid-line of this channel, the mid-line of the larger bullish channel, the daily support level at 59585.21, and the channel's lower boundary!!

‚úÖModerate Growth Scenario: A breakout below the smaller channel could lead to a retest of the larger channel's low. This low, which aligns with the static support range of 57877.90-58545.41, represents a second and final opportunity to halt the decline and initiate a new upward leg toward our price targets!!

üîªBearish Scenario: A breakout below the larger channel on the 4-hour timeframe, coupled with the activation of our daily stop-loss, would signal a temporary bearish phase.


‚ö†Ô∏èPlease note that this analysis represents my personal opinion and should not be solely relied upon for decision-makingüôè‚ù§Ô∏è

Bitcoin fooled traders where fakeout had another card in play. 

We are now entering again into the zone of fakeout, where price might see some liquidity movement. 

Our gameplay still remains the same for now and we wait for the price to fill lower zones here, so we wait to see the price again below 200EMA.

In a previous analysis, I discussed the relationship between Bitcoin, the Altcoin market and Bitcoin Dominance. 


An important rotation exists between these three; and by using TOTAL3 together with BTC.D, you can get a clearer picture of where BTC is trading in the current cycle.


In this video, I make an important suggestion based off Elliot Wave Theory. This theory is backed up by the points mentioned but also by the Logarithmic view:


From the log scale, we can see BTC is still trading relatively low compared to previous cycle top-outs. So the question remains -  the end... or just the beginning?

Buy Level: 58000
Target Level: 66000

The BTCUSD pair shows a promising upward trajectory on the 4-hour chart. A key buy signal is identified at the level of  $58,600. This level represents a strategic entry point, aligning with current technical indicators suggesting strong support and potential for a bullish movement.

Once entered, the target level is set at $66,000, where significant resistance is expected. This target reflects a potential gain based on the current market structure  and momentum.

Don't forget to set your stop loss!
Functionality and Key Features 
 
 Volume Momentum Using MACD: This indicator calculates the MACD based on smoothed volume changes. By using the difference between two moving averages of volume (short-term subtracted from long-term), it highlights significant shifts in volume momentum, which are essential for confirming trend strength and sustainability.
 Fractal Analysis: Fractals are used to identify natural repetition patterns in price movements around significant highs and lows. This indicator employs multiple fractal lengths to capture a comprehensive picture of market structure and pivot points, enhancing the detection of potential trend reversals or continuations.
 Trend Confirmation: By combining the insights from volume momentum and fractal analysis, this tool filters out false signals and provides a more reliable confirmation of the underlying market trend.
 
 
 How It Works 
 
 The MACD of volume highlights shifts in market momentum, with a focus on how recent volume compares to historical norms.
 Fractals delineate critical points in the price structure, offering visual cues about potential turning points based on historical price action.
 The indicator synthesizes these elements to paint a clear picture of potential trend developments, signaling green when both volume momentum and fractal proximity suggest a bullish trend, and red when they indicate bearish conditions.
üìä#BTC support zone rebound has been achieved‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural point of view, we constructed a small long structure within the target area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe double top short structure. Currently, the goal of this structure has been achieved, and the target area overlaps with the uptrend resistance line, and the overlapping part is considered The heaviest resistance zone. Therefore, we need to be wary of the risk of a pullback and not chase the rise in the resistance zone.

I think funds are still flowing into the coin market.

Therefore, as long as funds flow into the coin market, the coin market is expected to continue its upward trend.


However, I think that it is necessary to adjust the investment ratio because the trading volume is not the same as before (box section).

-----------------------------------------------

(1D chart)

The horizontal line drawn on the chart indicates the volume profile section.

Therefore, the strongest volume profile section at the current price position is around 58697.01.

In addition, the volume profile section currently being formed is 56843.36, 64179.08.

The PVT indicator is a component of the BW indicator.

Since the PVT is currently in a downward trend, we can see that the downward strength is strong.

Therefore, when it rises above 58697.01, it is important to see whether the PVT turns into an upward trend.

-
(1D chart)

If it receives support near 57889.10, it is highly likely that the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator will turn upward.

Therefore, the key is whether it can receive support near 57889.10 and rise above 59053.55.

However, since the current StochRSI indicator is in the overbought zone and has a change in slope, there is a possibility that it will make a short-term high near 57889.10.

If the StochRSI indicator turns downward this time, whether it will receive support near 56150.01-56950.56 is an important key.

-
(1W chart)

If PVT falls below the dotted line on the 1W chart, there is a high possibility that it will turn into a downtrend.

Therefore, you should check whether it can be supported near 57122.77, which is the lower point of the HA-High indicator box on the 1W chart.

--------------------------------------------

Since the trading period is mostly different, the chart analysis will differ depending on which point you start trading from.

Therefore, the points or sections I mentioned are points or sections that can affect the trend.

I think the point that has the greatest influence on the trend change from the current price position is the 57889.10 point.

In order for the trend change to expand, it must break out of the 56150.01-59053.55 section.

-
From a short-term perspective, it seems that it is currently forming a short-term high.

So, to break above this short term high, it needs to be supported above 59053.55.

-
Have a nice time.

Thank you.

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

The real uptrend is expected to start after rising above 29K.

The area expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

-----------------
The layout on the 4H chart:
- In the short-term trend, a decline to 57,745 is expected.
- In the mid-term trend, a rise to 62,818 is anticipated, with consolidation above that level potentially leading to collection of liquidity above ATH, up to 74K

Key point: The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates will be announced on September 18, 2024, at 18:00 UTC. The forecast is a 0.25% rate cut, though a 0.5% reduction is also possible.
Potential cut will boost growth of Bitcoin
By examining the trend in the one-hour time frame, Bitcoin has a resistance range of the ascending channel ceiling in the range of $60,625 and now, provided it is maintained, the price can decrease to the support range of the channel floor in the range of 57,632-57,243.
Assalamu Alaikum and Good Morning to All My Brothers and Sisters,

After observing the weekend's price action, it's time for our first Bitcoin analysis of the week. I waited until Monday to gain a clearer picture of Bitcoin's next move.

Current Market Outlook:
Bitcoin made an impressive jump last week, but now it appears we might be seeing a slight retracement. The price is currently consolidating near a bull flag pattern. If we get a confirmed breakout above the blue line on the 4-hour timeframe, we could soon witness a breakout of the yellow zone.

What's Next?
Should Bitcoin break and retest the blue line successfully, we could be in for a strong upward movement. The blue line is acting as support, and just above it, we've identified a key resistance on the 4-hour chart. A breakout here would be a very bullish signal. This could potentially send Bitcoin towards the $60k-$61k range. Breaking through the yellow area would be monumental, as it would open up the path to the next yellow zone, pushing us towards  GETTEX:64K  or higher.

Bearish Scenario:
On the flip side, a bearish scenario is quite straightforward. Yesterday, Bitcoin closed below the daily resistance (black line). If today's candle confirms this breakout on the daily timeframe, we could see Bitcoin lose all the gains it made last week. 

Altcoin Market:
Altcoins are following Bitcoin's movement, climbing up during Bitcoin‚Äôs surge and dropping during its retracements. Our recent confirmed breakout signals are still in profit, while others remain near their entry levels. We're waiting for clearer confirmations before opening additional buy trades, which will likely come after Bitcoin's direction becomes clear.

Stay tuned, and I wish you all a profitable week ahead. Have a great day!
Finally, Bitcoin broke the symmetrical triangle and the price can fall to the support zone. also 53k is a good price to buy again!!!

BINANCE:BTCUSDT  appears to have found support in the 54000 - 53800 area, as evidenced by three fake breakouts on the daily timeframe. This indicates that this level holds significant importance; each time the price dipped below 53800, it closed above it afterward. I believe the market may remain in a range until the Federal Reserve's rate cut decision on Wednesday. Currently, we are seeing the formation of a giant triangle pattern characterized by a series of lower highs and higher lows, suggesting that the price is coiling up in before an extension. Given this setup, I expect the market to oscillate within this range until we receive clarity from the Fed's decision. The tension in the market could lead to a volatile breakout in either direction once the decision is announced. My target is resistance zone around 65000

As of Sept. 16, 2024, bitcoin traded at $58,578, within a 24-hour range of $58,231 to $60,366.     The leading crypto asset saw a daily trade volume of $26.95 billion, with a market cap of $1.15 trillion.     Despite this high liquidity, bitcoin is struggling to break key resistance levels, as technical indicators show mixed momentum.

BitcoinOn the 4-hour chart, bitcoin‚Äôs recent dip from $60,670 has led to sideways trading, a sign of market indecision.    While the volume is moderate, the lack of a significant rally points to weak momentum.    Support at $58,000 mirrors the 1-hour and 4-hour charts, underscoring its importance.    Meanwhile, resistance at $60,000 persists.    If bitcoin can break above $59,000 with increasing volume, upward momentum might follow, though the current trend remains tilted to the downside.

The daily chart highlights a broader downtrend, stretching from a local high of $65,103 and bottoming around $52,546 before making a recovery attempt.   The $60,000 mark remains a tough barrier, and recent action shows lower highs, suggesting more potential losses without a surge in momentum.   A solid support at $55,000 acts as a safety net, but buyer confidence has been notably lacking.

Looking at oscillators, the relative strength index (RSI) sits at a neutral 50, reflecting indecision.   Stochastic at 82 signals that overbought conditions could limit short-term gains.   However, momentum indicators like the awesome oscillator and momentum flash some bullish signals, hinting at a possible short-term bounce if the right conditions arise.

Moving averages (MAs) offer a mixed outlook.   Short-term averages like the 10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) lean toward bullish optimism but longer-term averages, particularly the 50-day and 200-day, show bearish signals.   This split indicates that while short-term gains are possible, bitcoin remains at risk of further losses unless stronger buying power emerges.

Bull Verdict:
Despite the current challenges, bitcoin‚Äôs short-term MAs and momentum indicators suggest there may be room for a short-term bounce.  If the price breaks above $59,000 with increasing volume, bitcoin could reclaim the $60,000 mark, providing a favorable entry for bullish traders.  The long-term trend, however, will depend on sustained buying pressure and a confirmed break above key resistance levels.

Bear Verdict:
Bitcoin‚Äôs failure to break above $60,000, coupled with weak volume and lower highs across multiple timeframes, indicates potential for further downside.  Longer-term moving averages signal bearish momentum, and if the price dips below the $58,000 support level, a deeper correction toward $55,000 or lower is likely.  Without a significant reversal in volume, bearish traders may gain the upper hand
Hi guys, this is my overview for BTCUSDT, feel free to check it and write your feedback in commentsüëä

A few moments ago price entered to rising channel, where it reached $61800 level, broke it, and continued to move up.

Price reached resistance line, then it turned around and started to decline and soon exited from channel.

Next, price continued to decline in wedge, where it declined lower than $61800 and $55700 levels, breaking its.

Then BTC reached support line of wedge and then started to grow inside another rising channel.

In this channel, price broke $55700 level and at the moment it trades near resistance line of channel.

Possible, BTC can reach resistance line of channel and then start to decline to $55500

BTC Update:

Bitcoin is moving as expected. Yesterday, it made a sudden drop but quickly recovered. The current price of $58.1k needs to move strongly to continue the rally.

The RSI continues to gain bullish momentum and still has room to grow.

The target of  FWB:67K -$68k remains unchanged.

I'll provide updates on the altcoins shortly, so stay tuned. If you have any requests for specific altcoins, let me know in the comments or via DM.

Here is my trade plan on BTC on the next week. I assume that this is ICT's Market Maker Buy Model and last week the first stage disribution has been done. I expect the sceond stage distribution has been completed on the weekend or at least until Tuesday. So here is the chart for the idea :
hello guys.

it is a scalp position in short-term time frame if you are interested!

ü§öHello everyone,

üåüIt's clear that Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency, has the potential for significant growth after a period of stagnation. Some analysts even predict it will reach over $92,000 by the end of the year

üåüThere are rumors that, contrary to expectations, the Federal Reserve is going to increase interest rates, which could be bad news for Bitcoin. However, I believe that even if this happens, the impact will be short-term, and in my analysis, I discussed a short-term bearish phase. But keep in mind that this is just a rumor and there is no certainty

üåüOn the other hand, if interest rates decrease, it usually leads to an increase in the price of cryptocurrencies (which is more expected). The recent decline in the crypto market can be attributed to investors waiting for the Federal Reserve's late-week report on interest rates, as well as the failed attempt to assassinate Donald Trump

‚è±Daily Analysis üëâ #Bitcoin

‚úÖ‚úÖBitcoin has significantly increased its chances of growth after breaking through the monthly resistance level of 57877.90.

‚ÄºÔ∏èFollowing this breakout, we've witnessed a 3-day decline on the daily timeframe. However, this decline has been gradual and hasn't completely engulfed the previous bullish candle‚ùå

üöÄThe events of the past 4 days strengthen the scenario of a potential rebound after this corrective decline and upon reaching the critical support zone of 57877.90-58116.32.

üöÄOn the daily timeframe, the formation of a strong bullish candle that completely engulfs the previous three bearish candles would confirm a continuation pattern and signal a renewed uptrend.
üí∞(Note: I will discuss conditions for faster growth on lower timeframes in the subsequent analysis.)‚úåÔ∏è

‚úÖBullish Targets:
üöÄTarget 1: 61112.20-61640.68
üöÄüöÄTarget 2: 64149.35
üöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 3: 66755.85
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 4: 74537.70

üîªConversely, if weakness persists in the following days and Bitcoin breaks below the 57877.90 support on the daily timeframe, the stop-loss for the bullish scenario will be activated, and we can expect a temporary pullback towards the previous lows and support zones of 52083.28-52489.40 and 49000.00-50096.10.

üî•These support levels have the potential to halt the decline and initiate a new uptrend

.........................................
‚≠êÔ∏èContinuing the analysis based on the 1-hour timeframe‚è±

‚ö†Ô∏èDespite the downward break-out of the bullish channel on the 1-hour timeframe and the potential for increased selling pressure, Bitcoin has immediately encountered its most significant support zone (57700.79-58116.32).

üöÄThis could prevent further declines, even after the channel breakout.

üëÄThere is a possibility of bottoming patterns forming in this area, which could be the genesis of a new uptrend. Therefore, the price action in this zone for today and tomorrow should be closely monitored, especially on the 1-hour and 15-minute timeframesüí∏

‚úÖHowever, the current condition for the start of an uptrend based on the 1-hour timeframe is the breakout of the bearish trend-line of the recent bearish move (see figure)üöÄüöÄ

‚ùåThe stop-loss for the bullish scenario and entry into the bearish phase has been mentioned in the daily timeframe analysis (main analysis)üëÜ
From where we put the red arrow on the chart, it looks like a symmetrical (corrective) pattern is formed on the chart.

According to the waves, it seems that we are in the last wave of this symmetry (wave i).

We expect an upward price rejection from the green range.

Most likely, this bullish movement will be an x   wave, which means that it will not be a powerful movement.

We also expect downward price rejection from the supply box.

The complexity of the chart is high, observe capital management in your trades.

Closing a daily candle below the invalidation level will violate this view and analysis.

For risk management, please don't forget stop loss and capital management

Bitcoin took a significant hit yesterday, dropping past our initial target zone and finding support at the secondary zone outlined in Plan B.

The purpose of our plan is to identify key levels or zones that serve as strong areas for potential trades. If the Plan B level continues to hold, the price may form a potential leading diagonal, creating a wave structure from 1-5 as highlighted on the chart.

This scenario could push BTC's next target back to the 66k-68k range. This setup allows us to use a tight stop loss just below 56k.
 
It's a volatile market, so we should be prepared for any outcome. Trade safely.
BTC Double Top Pattern What's Text ?

Bitcoin Has Recently Formed a small double top pattern. The price had Already Broken down from the nick line confirming a further decline .

Speculation is high regarding the upcoming FOMC Meeting and the potential Rate cut they might announce. How ever BTC remains indifferent to these speculation and has not shown any significant rise in the recent days. If this situation persists BTC may continue to move downwards.

Should this trend continue BTC Could Potentially Drop further possibly reaching the 54K level.

I have been following the Bitcoin price action locally quite often, and would like to strategize a plan based on the current price action on the charts. 

At the moment, I believe we will likely move up to approx $60k to test the Value Area Low of the previous 6 month range. I do believe we will see seller's step in at that level and bring price back down below $50k where the low of the range liquidity can be taken and shoot right back up to grab the liquidity sitting above $70k. 

Being that rate cuts are quickly approaching, Im sure there will be some turbulence in the markets , especially around the election time. This uncertainty may bring us some amazing opportunities if we are well prepared.
Been on a bit of losing streak. But I think this is where it ends.

Base on my analysis anticipating  strong impulse push soon that'll possibly reach up to $59000.

Maybe resulting in a wick by day end. I do believe we are still heading to 45k. Just a matter of timing.

BITCOIN / 4H TIME FRAME

 HELLO TRADERS  

overall trading below 60,895 , it indicates prices of bitcoin under downward pressure.

Currently, prices are rising, approaching a critical turning point at 60,895. As long as trading remains below this level and stabilizes underneath it, a decline is expected, potentially reaching the support level at 57,827, and further down to 55,916. 

However, by breaking through this level and closing a 4-hour candle above it, prices could rise toward 63,611. To confirm an uptrend, prices need to remain above this level, which would suggest a continuation toward 66,527.

UPWARD TARGET : 633,611 , 66,525.
DOWNWARD TARGET : 57,827 , 55,916.

Hello everyone,

BTC has successfully closed above the $57,273 level, reversing the previous downward trend. This recovery came after a sharp 3.5% drop, which may have caused panic among some investors.

The next crucial resistance level for Bitcoin is $60,863.

Key Points:

Recovery: Bitcoin closed above $57,273.
Previous Drop: A 3.5% decline created market uncertainty.
Next Resistance: $60,863.
Immediate support: $57,273

Weekly timeframe is showing us a great dominance from sellers, where after each bullish movement they take back control and lead the price below last lows. 

Our gameplan has not changed, and the worst-case scenario for us is still the same: slowly but steadily we move towards the target here.

Although it is a short rise, the StochRSI indicator is already showing signs of entering the overbought zone.

Accordingly, the key is whether it can maintain the price above the MS-Signal indicator (M-Signal on the 1D chart) while receiving support near 56150.01-56950.56 and rising above 57889.10.

If not,
1st: 54730.0
2nd: 52137.67
You should check for support near the 1st and 2nd above.

Currently, since the M-Signal of the 1W chart > M-Signal of the 1D chart > M-Signal of the 1M chart, we need to check if it can lead to a movement to change the M-Signal of the 1D chart > M-Signal of the 1W chart.

Therefore, if it rises above 57889.10,
1st: 59053.55
2nd: 60672.0-61099.25
You can trade depending on whether there is support near the 1st and 2nd above.

The volatility period will begin soon.

As we pass around September 13 (September 12-14), we need to check in which direction it deviates from the 52137.617-61099.25 range and respond accordingly.



We are always at a crossroads.

I think we need to observe the flow of funds in the coin market to make a clearer choice at this crossroads.

It is not easy for individual investors to know the flow of funds.

We can only briefly understand the flow of funds due to stable coins such as USDT and USDC.

Currently, USDT is sideways, and USDC is gapping up, which is the driving force behind the coin market.

However, I think that USDT needs to gap up for the market to start a real uptrend.

Therefore, we need to think about how to increase the number of coins and tokens corresponding to profits while trading from a short-term perspective for the current uptrend.

Have a good time.
Thank you.

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after rising above 29K.

I Expected a  Crash From 64k Top  And  Rejection From 57k  At The Previous Updates

At This Update I Wanna Talk About BITCOIN At High Timeframe, So Lets Start

üìâ Wave 4 Shaped As a Complex Correction And These Types Of Corrections Are Too Boring And They Takes More Time Than Normal Correction To Complete, By Elliot View There Are Two Dynamic Target Areas For This Corrective Move ,44k And 39k

üéØ 44k Is a Typical Target That I Expect As a Wave 4 Target But If We Loss This Level 39k Is The Next 


üîê Totally We Are In a Corrective Trend And Till 44k Every Things Is Bearish And When We Touch 44k I Can Say It‚Äôs a Final Target Or We Will See 39k
Signal:
Green on 1st Ribbon for the second time

High Probability to see New High of all time, so I have invested all of available fund - I am ALL IN.

Michael Saylor's firm, already the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, plans to further increase its investment in the leading cryptocurrency. Despite market challenges, this bold strategy will continue to shape the company's future.
MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy continues to surprise the financial markets. After acquiring 18,300 bitcoins for $1.11 billion last week, the company announced a new financing plan.
The company will raise another $700 million through the issuance of senior convertible bonds. The decision, revealed by Michael Saylor on September 16, is in line with the company's ongoing bitcoin strategy. This is the third such bond issue in 2024, following similar operations in March and June.

The main goal of this fundraising is twofold. First, the Microstrategy plans to repay some of its existing debt, including $500 million of senior secured notes. Second, and most importantly, a large portion of the proceeds will be used to buy new bitcoins.

A risky but potentially profitable bet
The strategy of Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy, has so far proved beneficial. Since August 2020, the firm has invested $8.3 billion in bitcoin for an annual return of about 44 percent. That far outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which rose just 12 percent over the same period.
The company's stock has risen as much as 825%, outpacing even tech giants like Nvidia. This exceptional growth has made the company the undisputed leader in returns in the S&P 500 index.

Even though MSTR's stock recently fell 4.9 percent and is down 30 percent from its March high, MicroStrategy remains confident in its strategy. The company continues to bet on the growing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional and individual investors.

Overall, the company's strategy sticks to its bold vision of Bitcoin as a store of value in the future. Despite the challenges and criticism, this new funding confirms the company's commitment to its crypto strategy.

This practice will further stimulate the price and market of Bitcoin, and it will also be a major positive information for us traders. When we grasp the information and seize the opportunity, we will make the right operation, then we will get profits!
Short entry: 58.0 -- stop: 58.5 -- target: 52.0

This is an example of starting a trade, explaining that you should objectively define the basics that are right for you.

Therefore, I hope that this will be an opportunity to reexamine your trading judgment criteria rather than judging it as right or wrong.

-----------------------------------------


It is showing a downward trend without breaking through the sell line of the superTrend indicator.

Accordingly, the key is whether it can receive support near the M-Signal indicator (approximately 59953.52) on the 1W chart and rise above 60672.0-61099.25.

If not, you should check whether it is supported near the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart).

Therefore,
1st: 59053.55
2nd: 57889.10
You should check whether it is supported near the 1st and 2nd above.

-
Usually, there are many cases where you trade impulsively based on your psychological state.

To prevent this, it is good to have an objective trading method according to your investment style.

This objectification is best done at the support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

Therefore, it is good to trade based on whether it is supported near 59053.55 or 60720.0-61099.25.

However, judging whether it is supported only by sight can lead to an incorrect judgment depending on psychological factors that occur during trading, so it is good to have objective information as the basis for judgment.

It refers to indicators added to the chart as objective information.

The MS-Signal indicator is used as a trend-related indicator, which is the M-Signal indicator of the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

As a trading-related indicator, the HA-Low, HA-High indicators and their corresponding box sections, superTend, and volume profile are used.

As a trading-related reference auxiliary indicator, the BW indicator and StochRSI indicator are used.

-
If we explain the current movement by referring to these indicators,

- The superTrend indicator, which is passing around 60672.0-61099.25, has failed to rise above the sell line,

- It is showing a downward trend below the M-Signal indicator of the 1W chart,

- The StochRSI indicator is showing a trend of changing from an upward to a downward slope in the overbought section. However, since the StochRSI indicator has not yet fallen from the overbought zone and is not in a state where StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, it is difficult to see it as a downward turn.

Therefore, an aggressive sell (SHORT) is possible between the M-Signal indicator of the 1W chart and the 60672.0-61099.25 range.

Afterwards, when the StochRSI indicator falls from the overbought zone and becomes a state where StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, if it shows resistance near 59053.55 or the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator, you can sell (SHORT).

If it is supported at the point mentioned above, you can buy (LONG).

However, it is recommended to check whether the state has been changed to StochRSI > StochRSI EMA.

If not, it can pretend to rise and fall right away.

-
Have a good time. Thank you.

üìà Yesterday We Had a Good  Bounce To The 60k Area  From 57500$ And Its a Good Sign For Bulls At Low Timeframe, At This Update I Wanna Give You My Main View At Bigger Timeframe ,So Let‚Äôs Get Started 

üëâ 58500$ Is Crucial Resistance Level And The BITCOIN Price Breakout From It By The Strong Green Candle And Currently We Are At The Mid Range Of a Main Bull Flag

üì• By The Yesterday Bounce Bulls Entered The Game And I Expect 67700$ As a Next Target And Major Resistance As a 1.272% PRZ

üîê The Important Point Is As Long As The Price Playing Above 57500$ Is Priority Is Bullish
BTC latest analysis update:
This complex scenario will make both bull and bear suffer if they don't play it out phase by phase. 

I tried to keep it as simple as much possible, once you see the chart you will understand. 

Invalidation point: If it close 1day above 63k

Imagine what people will post once BTC break 48k support! they will call 38k and 42k, it will be fake wick breaking support then head towards 70k zone then final low to 38k not before. But I might be wrong because again this is a complex structure. However, thinking as market maker this will be the perfect scenario to hit both bull and bear. 

What you guys think?
I assume price will create a higher high to create a lower low later. Lets finish this corrective wave 4 already!
Current Position: Bitcoin is trading around $58,227, moving within a descending trendline pattern but showing signs of upward momentum as it nears a key horizontal resistance zone between $60,000 and $65,000.

 The major resistance zone is the brown-shaded area between $60,000 and $65,000. A clear breakout above this zone is necessary for a bullish continuation.

 Immediate support is marked by the green descending trendline around $54,000. The next significant support zone is the green area between $43,000 and $46,000, which has historically provided a strong base.

 A breakout above the $65,000 resistance zone could lead to a continuation towards $70,000 and potentially higher levels. Positive momentum indicators would support this scenario.

 If Bitcoin fails to break above the current resistance and faces rejection, it may retest the descending trendline support around $54,000. A drop below this could see Bitcoin revisit the $46,000 support zone or lower.

 Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance zone, and its ability to break through or face rejection will dictate the next significant move. Watch for a decisive move in either direction for confirmation of trend continuation or reversal.

 This analysis is for informational purposes and not financial advice. Stay vigilant with market updates and adjust trading strategies accordingly.
Price hit $60k as promised 

It needs to regress into its new low position next
Clear market structure is very important to trading

The dominant trend (higher time cycles) guide the lower ones

When it's ranged for days, the lower time frames are still tradable but with a higher risk 

Wherever you place your trades, ensure they are protected (don't go too big)
overall trading below 60,895 , it indicates prices of bitcoin under downward pressure.

Currently, prices are rising, approaching a critical turning point at 60,895. As long as trading remains below this level and stabilizes underneath it, a decline is expected, potentially reaching the support level at 57,827, and further down to 55,916.

However, by breaking through this level and closing a 4-hour candle above it, prices could rise toward 63,611. To confirm an uptrend, prices need to remain above this level, which would suggest a continuation toward 66,527.

UPWARD TARGET : 633,611 , 66,525.
DOWNWARD TARGET : 57,827 , 55,916.
It seems that low formed early, which was unexpected... not good for market structure 

for price to reach the next high responsibly a lot of buying has gotta happen. 

very interested to say the least

As of the author, the current section is the section where the 3-1 count and 3-2 counts end after the 4-count rise, and the 3-3 count rises after the 5-count section ends.

I think that if you manage your position while expecting the best event on the 19th, there is a high possibility of generating good profits.
Bitcoin has broken the falling trend channel in the short term and reacted strongly up. For the time being, it is difficult to say anything about the future trend direction. The currency is testing support at points 58000. This could give a positive reaction, but a downward breakthrough of points 58000 means a negative signal.

üìà BTC has been stuck in a descending channel, ranging between 50k and 70k.

As it approaches the 50k zone, we will be looking for medium-term long positions.

üèπ For a long-term trade targeting the 80k resistance, a break above the upper red trendline is required.

Which scenario do you think is more likely to happen first, and why?

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

The price perfectly fulfills my previous idea. It hit target level.  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  in continues to trend downward, showing a lack of buying pressure since the last week of August. The price action has consistently produced lower lows and lower closes. Even on the daily timeframe, we‚Äôre seeing these lower lows, despite a recent false breakout below the July low, with the price hovering around that area once again. Historically, September has been a challenging month for Bitcoin, often showing negative performance. This suggests there is a likelihood of the price moving further down, possibly breaching the 50,000 level and targeting the support zone between 48,000 and 45,000. Should the price reach this area, we could potentially see a strong bounce and the beginning of a new bullish trend. My target is support level at 51220.00



Traders, if you liked this idea or if you have your own opinion about it, write in the comments. I will be glad üë©‚Äçüíª
longing it for a tight stop loss , looks like it's about to bounce from the white marked line , overall structure at D1 looks bearish but imo it could bounce due to volatility in the market
Nice to see how well the levels of this chart are helping me trade this.

We just flipped the POC or highest volume node of the range (white box).

Bulls want to see volume pick up here after CME open, then we can play into 63-64k.

If we continue to make marginally higher highs on decreasing volume, I would look out for that HVN-support to break and play a rotation back to 54-55k
üìä#BTC reaches the staged resistance zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†We have been consolidating sideways in the selling zone for a long time. After finally digesting the selling pressure in this range, we chose to continue to break upward, so the selling zone turned into a support zone. At present, we have reached the stage resistance zone, and we do not recommend that you chase the rise in this range.

‚û°Ô∏èThe next resistance is located near the downward trend line (around 61k). If we develop relatively strongly, then the extreme resistance is located near the turning point 65175, which is also an ideal target area for the bull structure.

‚û°Ô∏èTherefore, we have locked in about 80% of the main profit, and will allow the remaining positions to wait for the ideal target without risk. üôèüéØ

We are now past Mercury's entire retrograde zone.

The downward retest on Wednesday 11 September did not reach 49K, it stopped at 52550. 

Moving forward I don't expect price to fall below @ 57041. That's close to the open on Thursday 12 September, which is the day that Mercury left His previous retrograde zone. I myself will try to get a fill to go long near Thursday's low.

  

On Monday 16 September Sun enters Virgo and reaches Venus's position of Sunday 25 August.

Bitcoin price will retest and  pass  65K on this date, continuing upwards.

After that I See bitcoin taking out its previous highs, because the next major downtrend only begins when Mars enters Cancer on Sunday 20 October. But for this leg up I hope to take profit at about 68K and then assess where to re-enter.

  BINANCE:BTCUSDT
After the consolidation it seems price is on its journey upwards

Typically the weekend liquidity drops off. Looking forward to Monday
Bitcoin  has been hovering near the $59,800 level, showing mixed signals across both the 1H and 4H charts. With the broader market awaiting a potential breakout towards the end of September, technicals reflect a market in consolidation mode, but with growing signals of a possible shift in momentum.

 1H Chart Breakdown: Weak Momentum Continues 

On the 1-hour chart, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain any upward momentum, hovering below the Bollinger Band Basis ($60,101). The RSI at 41.71 and the oversold Stochastic (%K at 12.62) show signs of a potential bounce, though weak MACD signals and a low ADX at 13.13 indicate limited trend strength.

Resistance: $60,356 (Upper BB)
Support: $59,846 (Lower BB)
MACD: Bearish momentum

 4H Chart Breakdown: Testing Key Resistance 

On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin faces a stronger challenge near the upper Bollinger Band ($61,348), with the RSI at 58.42 indicating that momentum is still neutral to slightly bullish. The Stochastic is signaling overbought conditions with %K at 72.63, suggesting a potential pullback, but the MACD remains bearish with a histogram reading of -70.04. The ADX at 20.91 is still weak, signaling that Bitcoin is lacking a definitive trend direction.

Support: $57,463 (Lower BB)
Resistance: $61,348 (Upper BB)
MACD: Bearish, showing weakening momentum
OBV: 3.021M, showing some accumulation but not enough to signal a breakout

 Support and Resistance Levels (Across Timeframes) 

Immediate Resistance (1H & 4H): $60,356 - $61,348 (Upper BB levels, key psychological resistance)
Immediate Support: $59,846 - $57,463 (Lower BB)

 Actionable Strategy: Range-Bound Trading with Weak Momentum 

 Bullish Scenario: 
If Bitcoin can break above the $61,348 resistance (4H Upper BB), it may push toward $62,000 and beyond. A strong volume surge would confirm this breakout.

 Bearish Scenario: 
Failure to break resistance could result in a pullback to $57,463 (4H support). If Bitcoin drops below this, watch for a further retracement to $54,000, which is still possible based on historical patterns.

 Action Point: 
Traders should monitor the $61,348 resistance closely for any breakout confirmation. In the event of a pullback, consider entering long positions near $57,463 if support holds.

Trendlines

Trendlines are essential tools for identifying support and resistance levels. The indicator automatically draws trendlines based on pivot points:

- Upward Trendlines (Support): Connect higher lows, indicating an uptrend.
- Downward Trendlines (Resistance): Connect lower highs, indicating a downtrend.

These trendlines help traders visualize the trend direction and potential breakout or reversal points.

---

Super Trend Reversals (ST Reversal)

The core idea behind the Super Trend Reversals indicator is to assess the momentum of automated trading bots (often referred to as 'Supertrend bots') that enter the market during critical turning points. Specifically, the indicator is tuned to identify when the market is nearing bottoms or peaks, just before it shifts direction based on the triggered Supertrend signals. This approach helps traders:

Engage Early: Enter the market as reversal momentum builds up.
Optimize Entries and Exits: Enter under favorable conditions and exit before momentum wanes.

By capturing these reversal points, traders can enhance their trading performance.

Let's analyse BTCUSDT in HTF.

Bitcoin is currently trading within a parallel channel on the weekly timeframe. However, a recent breakdown below the channel's midline is a cause for concern, as it could indicate a potential bearish reversal.
If we zoom in, we could see Bitcoin currently trading below the mid-line of the parallel channel on the weekly timeframe. A weekly close above $60,441 is essential for maintaining bullish momentum and targeting $70,000.
However, a rejection from this level could lead to a significant pullback towards $46,000 - $44,000.
Recommendation: It's advisable to consider taking profits on your long positions between $59,000 and $59,500.

Key levels to watch:
- Weekly closing above $60,441
- Booking profits before  GETTEX:59K 
-  GETTEX:46K  to $44k zone if BTC rejects

Happy Trading!!
Looking at the chart for **Bitcoin (BTC/USDT)**, here‚Äôs a breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. **Market Structure:**
The chart shows a series of **consolidation ranges**, marked by the purple boxes, with the price moving between these ranges over time. These ranges suggest that the market is in a sideways, ranging phase, with clear support and resistance levels being respected. 

### 2. **Key Levels:**
- **Resistance Level (around 61,176 USDT):** Bitcoin is currently near a resistance zone, and from the recent history of the price movement, this level has acted as a barrier multiple times.
- **Support Level (around 59,569 USDT):** The price has bounced off this level a few times as well, and it seems to be a significant support zone in the current market.

### 3. **RSI Indicator:**
The RSI is hovering around **64**, which is approaching overbought territory but is not quite there yet. This suggests that the price could still move upward a bit before the market considers it overbought, but caution is warranted as a reversal could happen.

### 4. **Trade Plan:**
- Based on the current structure, you seem to be expecting a **rejection from the resistance** level near 61,176 USDT.
- The **downward arrow** in the chart indicates that you're anticipating a sell-off or correction once Bitcoin reaches this resistance zone, with the price potentially moving toward the next support area.

### 5. **Potential Targets:**
- **Short-Term Target:** You may expect the price to drop back to the 59,569 USDT level initially, which is the nearest support zone. 
- **Longer-Term Target:** If the price breaks through this support level, the next target could be around 54,000 USDT, as indicated by the lower support zone.

### 6. **Conclusion:**
This trade idea appears to be a **sell setup**:
- **Sell near resistance (61,176 USDT)** if a rejection occurs.
- **First target** at **59,569 USDT** (support).
- If the price breaks lower, you could look for a **further decline toward 54,000 USDT**.

This setup follows a classic range-bound trading strategy where the price is expected to reverse at resistance and head toward the nearest support level. Monitoring the RSI and price action around these key levels will be crucial for timing the entry and exit of the trade.
If you haven`t sold the top on Bitcoin:


Now you need to know that as the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated rate cut approaches, the market is bracing for potential volatility, and Bitcoin could be no exception. While many expect a modest 25 basis point cut, a more aggressive 50 basis point reduction is also on the table. This larger-than-expected move could trigger a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù scenario, affecting not only traditional assets like the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) but also risk assets like Bitcoin.

Initially, Bitcoin may see a slight uptick in price at the beginning of next week. This short-term rise could be fueled by optimism and increased demand for alternative assets as the market digests the Fed's decision. Bitcoin has historically benefited from periods of loose monetary policy, and in the immediate aftermath of the rate cut, it might experience some buying pressure.

However, this rally could be short-lived. With broader markets such as SPY and QQQ expected to correct following the Fed decision, Bitcoin is likely to follow suit. Given its high correlation with risk-on assets during periods of market stress, Bitcoin may see a sharp pullback as traditional equity markets start to sell off. Traders could also unwind their positions in Bitcoin alongside stocks, leading to a broader market correction in both traditional and crypto assets.

In the short term, a Fed rate cut that exceeds expectations might signal concerns about the underlying economy, leading to heightened volatility across the board. As risk appetite wanes, Bitcoin's upward momentum could quickly reverse, aligning with the expected correction in SPY and QQQ.
üìä#BTC is still in the selling zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, we are still within the target area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe double bottom bullish structure, and we still need to be alert to the occurrence of a callback before completely breaking through this range.

‚û°Ô∏èIf you want to participate in long trading, you need to wait patiently for the target area to break through. After the target area turns into a support area, you can then look for opportunities to enter the long position in this range.

‚û°Ô∏èIf we fail to break through the target zone and return to the support zone again, then we can consider participating in some new long trades.

BTC price retraced and bounced off 0.786 fib so i expect this uptrend to be a bit weak and should go up till 65K before reversing. Will look for a sell entry in this position .
Bitcoin is right now doing a big stop hunt above the $58k level but closes negative/small positive body + big wick. I could see $56k as the next target because there are some clusters of liquidity.
I have moved my stop loss to break even as I said in my previous BTC trade idea fro this week. The idea seems working pretty well until now and let‚Äôs see what happens next. I will publish my take profits too if they hit.
TLDR for instant access of this document:
1 Fed Rate Cut Predictions: 50/50 chance of 0.25% or 0.50% cut, with 0.50% being more likely to prevent a market crash.
2 Market Insight: Expect high volatility in both BTC and stocks ahead of the rate cut, with manipulation and panic likely.
3 Strategy: Focus on strong risk management, protect holdings with stop-losses, and prepare for unpredictable market swings.
4 Mid-Term Outlook: Bullish through Q3 2025 with a likely resurgence in money printing after rate cuts..


 FED Rate Cut Report: Either .5 or .25 result, What‚Äôs Next? 
The Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate cut decision on September 18th is one of the most anticipated financial events of the year. There‚Äôs been a lot of speculation around whether the cut will be 
0.25% or 0.50%, with a 50:50 chance for either outcome. But if you've been following along, you know that I‚Äôve been calling for a less cut rate because 0.50% cut would open a can of worms which will lead us to 1 week of bloody market just like covid announcement, for months now I‚Äôve been thinking about 0.5 is a dangerous number to ask and the reasons are very simple that is why I decided to ask for 0.25 as this number is not easy to comprehend  and can manipulate and delay pumps vs 0.5 as this is clear crash and any crash so far was heavily bought by billionaires institutions and even retails, and the reasons are clear why.
 
 0.25% Cut vs. 0.50% Cut: A 0.25% cut at this stage would be too little. We‚Äôve already seen a significant market crash recently, and a small cut wouldn‚Äôt provide the economic support needed to stabilize things. On the other hand, a 0.50% cut would signal that the Federal Reserve is serious about maintaining economic momentum, particularly in light of falling inflation numbers.
 
 
 Inflation Data: I predicted twice that both the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index) would come in better than expected, and both predictions played out as expected. These improved inflation numbers give the Fed the leeway to justify a larger rate cut, and Jerome Powell will likely highlight this during the announcement.
 
If the Fed opts for the 0.25% cut, expect another market crash similar to the recent "Blood Monday" we witnessed. But with a 0.50% cut, the Fed can calm the markets, point to falling inflation, and possibly signal more cuts on the horizon.


 Market Insight: A Gamble on BTC and Stocks 
In the lead-up to the rate cut decision, the markets‚Äîespecially Bitcoin and stocks‚Äîare a complete gamble. It‚Äôs a casino right now, and anyone making moves in the market must be prepared for wicks on both sides and extreme volatility.
 
 Scam Wicks: Expect manipulations on both the long and short sides, with rapid price movements designed to shake out traders. This volatility is typical when the market is uncertain about a major event like the rate cut.
 
I‚Äôm personally holding my positions‚Äîboth spot and the longs I called at $50K and $53K during the recent crash that we missed and we are wrong about it means we failed to ride 48K as also stated in many of my live videos.. But for those who haven‚Äôt positioned themselves yet, be extremely cautious. If the 0.50% cut materializes, we could see short-term panic, especially with potential geopolitical risks like Israel possibly invading southern Lebanon adding fuel to the fire.
However, despite this short-term chaos, I remain bullish through Q3 2025 JULY. For long-term investors, these periods of panic can be a buying opportunity‚Äîespecially when fear peaks. Right now, my focus is on holding my current positions and waiting for the dust to settle.


Strategy for the Short Term: Manage Your Risk
In the short term, the key to surviving this period of volatility is risk management. If the Fed announces a 0.50% cut, both Bitcoin and stocks will likely face pressure, compounded by potential geopolitical events like the Israel-Lebanon conflict. Markets may react with fear, and the Fed could use this as a convenient excuse, attributing the market's reaction to geopolitical uncertainty rather than the rate cut itself.
 Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm managing my risk: 
 
 Stop-Losses: All my spot holdings and long positions are protected with stop-losses set at entry. This way, I minimize my risk‚Äîif the market takes a sharp turn, I won‚Äôt lose anything, but I‚Äôm also in position to ride a rally if the market moves upward.
 
 
 Stay Cautious: My risk management right now is at the highest level it‚Äôs ever been. This market is highly unpredictable, and my primary focus is on protecting my capital. I recommend others adopt the same strategy. Whether you‚Äôre managing a six- or seven-figure portfolio, this is the time to be extra cautious.
 
If the rate cut triggers a market pump, I‚Äôll simply ride the wave with my existing positions. But if we see a dump, my stop-losses will activate, protecting me from any losses. This is about surviving days like these‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to predict every move; you just need a solid plan for volatile periods. Surprises are inevitable, but with the right strategy, you can maximize gains and minimize risk.


 Mid-Term and Long-Term Outlook: Flood of Money Printing 
In the mid-term, any panic that arises will eventually be drowned out by the inevitable flood of money printing. We‚Äôve already seen examples of this in the past few months, with $18 billion USDT printed and more cash injections likely coming in Q4 2024, particularly from FTX.
Once the rate cuts are done, you can bet that the money printers will go back into full swing. Jerome Powell will likely have to pull the trigger on this again soon. This is why, despite the short-term volatility, I remain fully bullish for the mid- to long-term. The short-term is all about surviving the chaos, but in the long term, the Fed will continue to prop up the markets with fresh liquidity.

Price has entered demand zone. 

Looking at ADX we were in a downtrend but ADX value is below 25 (weak downtrend). 

Expecting price to reverse from here. Long to 65K
Bitcoin is approaching the key support level of $56K, rebounding from the support level of $56,000 and thus achieving a recovery
On Friday, the Bitcoin price failed to close above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $60,685 and the downtrend line (multiple highs from the end of July).
Over the next three days, it fell 3.78 percent. At the time of writing today, the Bitcoin price continues to fall back to $58.8K.

If Bitcoin continues to pull back, it could find support near the daily level of $56,022. If this support can hold, it could make another attempt to break the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $60,685 and the downtrend line.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the awesome Oscillator (AO) on the daily chart are hovering near their neutral levels of 50 and 0, indicating that neither the bulls nor the bears can control the momentum. For the above bullish moves to continue, both indicators must be above neutral.
However, if Bitcoin closes below the daily support of $56,022, the bullish argument will fail. In this case, Bitcoin could retest the psychologically important level of $54K.
Earlier last week, disappointment around Trump's presidential debate performance led to  MARKETSCOM:BITCOIN  "selling the news,‚Äù dropping below $56K. This drop was anticipated on a technical basis, and the reaction was muted after higher-than-expected inflation figures on Wednesday were absorbed.

Markets were initially anticipating a 25 basis point rate cut from the Fed. However, recent data has shifted expectations towards a potential 50 basis point reduction. This change has added to Bitcoin's short-term uncertainty, as traders may be gearing up for a more significant cut. A rate cut @ 25 basis points could lead to a short-term sell-off as traders re-adjust.

Nonetheless, Bitcoin's consistent upward movement this week has led to a shift in sentiment to "cautiously optimistic." Prices are significantly improved compared to the levels observed when Bitcoin was hovering around the 53K mark.

With that in mind, this should be the level to bid if one considers the BMS and the current importance of staying above the mid-$56K range.

-----------

The key level for the entire market is critical. I would welcome a retest of the $42-44K range if September sees a downturn. For now, this is the level to target if you're bullish. A break below this range would shift my outlook to bearish, with the target previously mentioned in mind.

In the event of a breakdown, we need to see a V-shaped reversal to counteract the bearish trend. Without a strong reversal, expect bearish market conditions for the next six months.
Hello my dear friends, another weekly session is over and new data becomes available. 
Let's review those in an unbiased way and see what the chart is saying.

‚ûñ The 2-Sept. week just closed at 54,869. This is after being rejected by EMA34.
‚ûñ It is the first time that Bitcoin closes below EMA34 in more than a year.
‚ûñ It is the worst weekly close since Bitcoin moved above 60,000 in February.
‚ûñ It is the worst weekly close, coming out of a major high, since November 2021.

‚ûñ The weekly session also closed below the 0.382 Fib. retracement level relative to the bullish wave that started in September 2023; a major support lost.

‚û¢ Everything is ultra-bearish. 

‚ûñ The weekly session that just closed also ended as a Doji but red. Signaling the continuation of the previous candle. The previous candle was a full red candle.

‚û¢ Everything is so bearish that we need not go any further.

I would love to entertain you more but it would be a waste of time.

All the signals coming from this chart are saying that  Bitcoin is about to crash .

Namaste.
In the local setup, I see a good opportunity for execution, with a risk/reward ratio of 1 to 5, which is very favorable. However, the risks here are quite high, so I will enter with a small portion. Reasons for entry. Based on the structure, it‚Äôs clear that we are retracing to 0.382 or 0.618 and then heading down. You can check this yourself. Since my portfolio is long, I won‚Äôt have any significant losses. If we drop, I‚Äôll reinvest part of it.Reasons for entry.

If we compare the stock market drops at August 05 and September 03, we can say that the crypto market is still holding up very well.
 But we shouldn't relax, because there are a lot of events coming up in September that will set the tone for the Autumn: 
1Ô∏è‚É£ September 6 - data from the labor market. July 5 and August 5 were extremely volatile downward after the data release. Now the market interprets and considers the most important indicator of the health of the US economy to be not inflation but the number of jobs created. Based on this data, on August 5, the market plunged into a not so pleasant weekend when  CRYPTOCAP:BTC   went below $50K.
2Ô∏è‚É£11 September - publication of the CPI and inflation data in the United States.
3Ô∏è‚É£18 September - the results of the two-day Fed meeting, the announcement of a rate cut. It's elegant that this day is also a full moon, conspiracy theorists are on the base)
4Ô∏è‚É£20 September - a hat trick - a day when stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options expire on the same day. This happens only four times a year - on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, which can lead to a sharp increase in trading volume and volatility.

Hello, I'm Whale_signal

First of all, it's the 1H-BTCUSDT chart I uploaded last time

Exactly $2500 uplift beam from the orange whale indicator

Congratulations to those who are profitable


I also bought from the orange whale index and took my earnings off the purple whale index
It was a place where everyone was able to make a big profit


BTCUSDT - I think it's a section where we're pulling together by breaking through the 1H falling channel upward


In addition, we think that if we break through a certain price range in the future, we can show the possibility of a trend change

It will be a very important position for investors

The section will be shown in the *whale indicator real-time chart sharing below

Nice BTC Bitcoin short confluence scalp trade setting up. Daily level, golden pocket, and pivot point all lined up for a strong resistance.
Hello All,

Welcome to the quick update of  BTCUSDT . We have seen BTC touch the levels of $ 52500  and retrace a bit until $ 58000  but couldn't hold it.

We can see it dumping and is currently trading around $56100.

The next levels to watch out for are  $54700 and $53800 . If this holds, we can see BTC pump again and might make a new high in a few months.

 Support levels: $54700. $53900, $49600 in the long run.

Resistance levels: $58027, $61100, $64000, and $72000 in the long run. 

Let's wait and see how this pans out. Until then, stay tuned and trade with caution, ensuring strict  STOPLOSSES !!

Bitcoin can slowly move towards 60,800, but it is expected to decrease in the two targets of 57,000 and 5,3800. Closing the candle above 61,200 can cancel this decrease.
Hello everyone, let's look at the current BTC situation considering the one hour interval.  In this situation, we can see how the price has moved higher from the local downtrend line above which it remains.
  Let's start by setting goals for the near future, which include:
T1- 60252$
T2- 62340$
T3- 64922$
  Now let's move on to the stop-loss in case the market continues to decline:
  SL1 = $58,076
  SL2 = $56,190
  SL3 = $555,256 AND
  SL4 = $54,044

  Looking at the RSI indicator, we see a movement at the upper limit, which may influence an attempt to recover or give a temporary sideways trend.
On a smaller timeframe, we see a pattern has repeated itself where we had a small fakeout above 200 EMA. 

As the new week has started and we are back below that EMA, we are looking for further movement to lower zones from here!

Bitcoin bounced off the ascending trendline and bounced off the support level. Bullish movement to resistance level at 60420 is expected to happen.
üëâ In My Idea At Current BTC Situation There Is No Worry About The Market And We Are At The Corrective Phase At Low Timeframe Before Breakout The Trend Line

üìà 57500$ Is a PRZ That I Named It As a Wave 2 From Main Impulse Or Wave A From Main 2, At Both Scenarios We Are At The Correction Wave Not a New Bear Trend And At Worst Scenario We Will See 56k Area As a Wave 2 Low Before Break The 60700$ Resistance
I‚Äôm shorting a very interesting setup here on the BTCUSDT 4H chart. We have an untapped 2H and 4H Order Block (OB) sitting above the current price, coupled with an untapped VWAP, both of which are significant points of interest for me. These untapped areas often act as strong magnets for price, drawing it towards them before a potential reversal.

Given the current market structure, this setup presents a high-probability short opportunity. The price has been showing signs of exhaustion as it approached these levels, and the confluence of the Order Blocks and VWAP makes it a very appealing zone to initiate a short position.

What adds to the strength of this setup is the clear Break of Structure (BOS) visible in the previous price action. The market has been creating lower highs and lower lows, indicating a downtrend, and the current move up might just be a retracement to mitigate the OB before continuing the trend downward.

I‚Äôm entering this trade with a tight stop loss, as the OBs and VWAP should ideally cap the upward movement. The stop loss is placed just above the OB, ensuring that the risk is minimal in case the price unexpectedly breaches these levels.

As for the final target, I haven‚Äôt set a specific level yet. I‚Äôll be closely monitoring how the price reacts after entering the OB and the VWAP. If the price rejects sharply, I‚Äôll consider holding the position longer, potentially trailing the stop to lock in profits as the trade progresses. However, if the reaction is weak or if I see signs of reversal, I might close the trade early.

The goal here is to capitalize on the anticipated price reaction from these high-probability zones while keeping the risk contained with a tight stop. This is a classic example of a mean reversion trade, where the price could revert back to the mean after tapping into these untapped areas.
I was on spot in see the movement in 2023, see > 

Now I see a clear path to 100k in January 2025!!! 

I see 3 steps:
# one testing the ATH at 73k,
# small correction,
# 80K ATH,
# 100k in January 2025!
BTC double could play out. 

In worst case scenario, BTC will form a double top on M, and then correct back to its major support which is around 33K. 
If BTC did not form double top, rather broke its previous ATH, then there will be a price discovery and we may see a new ATH.
In this analysis of the Bitcoin/USDT daily chart, we observe several key technical patterns and indicators that guide my trading decisions. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $60,532.70, showing a significant increase of 3.98% on the day.

Firstly, the resistance levels (R1 and R2) and support levels (S1 and S2) are crucial in understanding potential price barriers. The first resistance level (R1) at approximately $56,715.30 has been recently breached, suggesting a bullish momentum. The next significant resistance level (R2) is at around $65,272.36, which could be the target if the bullish trend continues.

Conversely, the support levels (S1 and S2) at $48,629.92 and roughly $49,000 respectively, provide areas where price pullbacks might stabilize and potentially reverse.

The price has recently broken out of a downward trend, indicated by the red trendline, and has moved upward, crossing this boundary, which is a bullish signal. If the price can maintain above this breakout level, it would confirm the continuation of the bullish trend.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also indicative of growing bullish momentum, as the MACD line (blue) crosses above the signal line (orange). This crossover, coupled with a positive histogram, supports the idea of increasing buying pressure.

Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46.21, though closer to the middle, shows that there's room for upward movement before the asset becomes overbought. This indicates potential for further price increases before hitting overbought territory.

In conclusion, my analysis suggests that Bitcoin is currently on a bullish trajectory, having broken key resistance and showing strong signals on both MACD and RSI indicators. My strategy will involve closely watching the $65,272.36 resistance level for potential sell signals, while maintaining vigilance on the support levels for buy opportunities should any pullbacks occur.

Buy in incomming dips in important support and ejoy from upcoming bullrun.
Current Range: BTC is trading within a significant horizontal range between approximately $52,000 (support) and $68,000-$72,000 (resistance). This range has been respected since March 2024, with several bounces between these levels.

Descending Channel Breakout: Recently, BTC has broken out of a descending channel pattern (marked by the white lines). This breakout suggests a potential shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. If this breakout holds, BTC may see a continuation of upward movement.
 Around $54,000 (near the green trendline), which has acted as a strong support level throughout this range.
The upper boundary of the range near $68,000-$72,000 remains the key level to watch for any potential breakout to the upside.

If BTC continues to hold above the breakout level and gains momentum, the next major resistance will be the upper range boundary near $68,000-$72,000. A successful breakout above this level could potentially target higher levels around $76,000.


If BTC fails to maintain the breakout and falls below the descending channel, we could see a retest of the lower support around $54,000. A break below this level would likely lead to a test of the lower range boundary around $52,000 or even lower levels.
Momentum indicators like RSI or MACD were not included in the chart, but adding these could confirm the breakout's strength.
BTC/USDT shows potential for further upside following the breakout from the descending channel, with key levels to watch at $68,000-$72,000 for resistance and $54,000 as immediate support. As long as BTC maintains above the breakout level, the bias remains bullish, but caution is warranted near the upper boundary of the range.

üìä#BTC reaches the target zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural point of view, the double bottom bullish structure constructed near the buying zone has all the target zones achieved, so we need to be alert to the risk of a pullback.

‚û°Ô∏èFrom a wave theory perspective, if we start the Elliott Pulse Wave from here, then we can expect wave 5 to occur

‚û°Ô∏èSo, if you are involved in some long transactions, you can lock in the main profits and look forward to more. Unfortunately, yesterday's pullback did not touch our entry price, so we can only wait patiently for the next opportunity to come.

Bitcoin is positioned to break through the $60,000 resistance, supported by bullish momentum and strong technical indicators. A sustained move above this level could propel the price to $63,000, with the 0.618 Fibonacci level providing solid support around $55,300 in case of a pullback.
Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price rose to resistance 2, which coincided with the resistance zone and broke this level. Then it rose a little higher than the resistance zone and some time traded near until it reached the trend line and then BTC started to decline. In a short time price declined to resistance 1, which coincided with one more resistance zone, breaking resistance 2. As well, the price started to trades inside the wedge, where it rebounded from resistance 1 and tried to grow, but failed and soon dropped back. Some time later BTC fell to the resistance zone and at once rebounded to the trend line, which is the resistance line of the wedge also, and then declined to the support line of the wedge, breaking resistance 1. Recently price bounced up to this level and tried to break it, but failed and now trades below. In my mind, BTCUSDT will make a small movement up and then continue to decline to support line of the wedge. Therefore I set my goal at 54800 points.

TL;DR for Busy Readers

 
 95% confidence that Bitcoin has bottomed at $52.5k, with the worst possible scenario at $50.4k.
 The USDT Dominance Chart is showing resistance levels not seen since the last bear market when Bitcoin was around $27k.
 For Bitcoin to hit $44k, USDT dominance would need to enter bear market territory, which is highly unlikely.
 A 30%+ downside move in USDT dominance suggests more capital will flow into Bitcoin, signaling a bullish uptrend.
 The odds are heavily in favor of Bitcoin moving upward from here, and I expect it to play out over the rest of the month.
 

I‚Äôm 95% confident that we‚Äôve bottomed out at $52.5k, and the worst case scenario would be $50.4k. Additionally, I‚Äôm 95% certain we won‚Äôt see a drop to $44k or anywhere near it. Here‚Äôs why.

 The USDT Dominance Chart: A Key Indicator 
One of the most reliable charts for predicting Bitcoin tops and market reversals is the USDT Dominance chart. This chart tracks the dominance of Tether (USDT) in the market, and right now, it‚Äôs showing levels not seen since the last bear market when Bitcoin was trading around $27k.

Currently, USDT Dominance is at critical resistance, touching levels that are typically only observed during bear markets. Historically, when USDT dominance hits these levels, it signals a bottom for Bitcoin and the beginning of an uptrend.

Additionally, the USDT dominance chart indicates we could see over a 30%+ move to the downside in USDT dominance, meaning more capital will flow out of stablecoins and back into Bitcoin and other cryptos. This is a strong indicator that Bitcoin is bottoming out and preparing for a bullish move.

 Why $44k is Unlikely 
For Bitcoin to drop to $44k, USDT dominance would have to enter territory that we‚Äôve only ever seen in true bear markets. If this happens, it could break the higher timeframe (HTF) structure on both the USDT dominance chart and the Bitcoin chart, and ultimately, we wouldn‚Äôt just stop at $44k‚Äîwe‚Äôd probably end up around $30k.

 That‚Äôs why if you‚Äôre hoping for $44k , you‚Äôre really wishing for a major bear market that could pull Bitcoin down much further. This scenario would mean a shift in the current market structure, which doesn‚Äôt align with the probabilities we‚Äôre seeing.

 Upside Probability is Much Higher 
While there‚Äôs always a chance that USDT dominance could break higher and push the market lower, the probability of this happening is very small in my opinion. Investing is all about probabilities, and when we assess the entire market situation, it‚Äôs clear that the upside is heavily favored right now.

Based on the data, the market structure, and the USDT dominance chart, the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing upward from here is very high. It‚Äôs important to monitor how the market behaves in the coming weeks, but all signs point toward a bullish move.

 My years of experience kind of Opinion 
In summary, the USDT dominance chart is signaling that we‚Äôve likely seen the bottom at $52.5k, and the chances of Bitcoin falling to $44k or lower are extremely slim. If anything, this level of USDT dominance typically indicates that a Bitcoin rally is on the horizon. Stay cautious, but it looks like the market is gearing up for an uptrend. Let's see how the rest of the month plays out, but from where I stand, the upside looks very promising.

TLDR: 
The prevailing concept in CT is that once the Fed begins a QE cycle, prices of financial assets immediately shoot up. 
The data from two previous cycles tell a different story. The market doesn‚Äôt immediately react to rate cuts, if at all. It is after the rate cuts ended that the uptrend begins. 
 2007/2008 Rate Cut Cycle: 
Based on historical data from 2007 and 2008, Nasdaq 100. The first month of QE resulted in a bullish response. However, it was followed by a downtrend until the rates were zero. 
    
 2019/2020 Rate Cut Cycle: 
Based on the BLX chart. Excluding the initial bullish reaction, this QE cycle did not affect Bitcoin‚Äôs price. After rates were at zero, Bitcoin‚Äôs uptrend began. 
  
 Takeaways From Previous QE Cycles 
1. Fed cuts don‚Äôt change the trend. At least until the cutting cycle is over. 
2. Even if we assume a bullish reaction, it is short-lived. 
3. The Fed is late in responding to market conditions. 
4. The chances of a 50% rate cut in September are low. 
5. The Fed overreacts to recession conditions.
6. When the markets begin to tumble, it is a dumpster fire. The fed cannot put out the fire with rate cuts. 
 Bitcoin Cycle Analysis: 
My macro-outlook for Bitcoin remains that Bitcoin is in the process of completing a wave four correction, after which I expect a continuation of the bullish trend to at least 80K.
Within the wave four correction, the two primary scenarios are:
  
 Complex Correction: 
This scenario presumes that Bitcoin is in a wave four correction. According to this scenario, the final leg down in wave C of Y is missing. 
If this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, Bitcoin should begin wave C to the downside after hitting the reversal zone between 0.618 and 0.786 retracements. 
  
 ABCDE Triangle Breakout: 
According to this scenario, Bitcoin‚Äôs wave four bottom was on August 5th. Bitcoin consolidates in an ABCDE triangle before breaking out to the upside in the final 5th wave. 
If this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, Bitcoin is close to the 0.618 retracement. I expect it to be rejected between 61.1K and 62.5K (wick) to complete the final E wave. This will become the primary scenario if it can find support at around 54K and break out of the triangle. 
  
 Direct Breakout Scenario: 
This scenario assumes that Bitcoin finished the correction process on September 6th and is now on the verge of a breakout. Even if this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, I expect a pullback to 57K - 58K before continuing. 
 High Probability Support and Resistance Levels: 
1. 65K. Resistance.
 2. 62.5K. Resistance. 
3. 61K. Resistance.
 4. 58K. Support.  
5. 56K. Support. 
 6. 54K. Support.

on Sunday and Monday morning BTC reached a deep discount, opening on Monday with a big gap and a new decline but not lower than the opening on Friday
At the top there is an unclosed gap - with a mark of the middle of the gap
Hello there,

BTC went down to 49221.93 and rallied up to 64133.59 for appears to be a B in a corrective wave. The higher low at 53315.24 creates the impression that price will continue bullish since to 49221.93, but that will need confirmation above (B) where in sits a supply zone.

Current candle structure does not support a strong bullish momentum but the break below of 57642.58 will be meaningful for any indication of bearish continuation.

The sentiment right now is highly bearish with two price targets for a bias of 31265.28

 Summary  : Current trend shows weak bullish momentum, and a drop below 57642.58 could indicate further bearish action, leaning strongly bearish toward even lower lows.

Happy Trading,
K.
We retested our long POI on very strong momentum caused by SPX flow.

We could look for shorts at a sweep of our local highs around 58.1k, but I'd expect it to overshoot and give us 59.1 or the 59.8-60.6 zone where value got capped a few times in the past weeks.

I'm still not ruling out new lows, but the reaction at this 60k zone will be important to monitor and determine the next few weeks of price action possibly.

Hi traders,

Last week Bitcoin followed exactly my analysis. So did you profit from this? 

Next week we could see another upmove from the 4H FVG.

Let's see what the market does and react.

Trade idea: Wait for a change in orderflow to bullish, a small correction down on a lower timeframe and trade longs.

If you want to learn more about my analysis, please make sure to follow me, give a like and respectful comment.

This shared post is only my point of view on what could be the next move in this pair based on my analysis. I do not provide signals.

Don't be emotional, just trade!

Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we had a strong day for Bitcoin, with a solid move to the upside, indicating positive momentum from the bulls. However, Bitcoin is now facing strong resistance at $60,800. If it breaks through this resistance level, we could see a push all the way up to $64,800, which is the next major resistance. However, it's more likely that Bitcoin will hit this resistance and pull back to around the $58,700 area. As I‚Äôve mentioned before, we‚Äôre not out of the woods yet. There's still downward momentum, and I‚Äôll keep you updated in the coming days and weeks.
Dated today,  PHEMEX:BTCUSDT.P   had dropped 33% from it's All-time High $73851 at 14th March 2024. Despite the overall bearish sentiment in the market, Bitcoin's recent creation of a Higher Low $52500 at 6th September suggests a potential bullish reversal.

Today, we will delve into how the price of BTC might move in the next few days.

 1. Bullish Breakout.  
If Bitcoin can break above its previous high near $65,000, it would signal a strong bullish reversal. Following this, a period of accumulation might occur, to accumulate more buying power before a push towards the next resistance level around $72,000.

 2. Bearish Drop.  
Alternatively, Bitcoin could continue its downward trend, potentially retesting support levels at $50,000 and $41,900. To assess whether these levels offer buying opportunities, consider the trading volume and Relative Strength Index (RSI) during the decline.If the trading volume is lower than it was on August 5th and the RSI is higher, $50,000 might be a good price to buy the dip. However, if the volume is higher and the RSI is lower, $41,900 could be a better choice for buying low.

 3. Consolidation.  
Given the recent volatility, a period of consolidation between $65,000 and $52,500 is possible. This scenario might present opportunities for traders to employ Phemex Neutral Grid bots to profit from price fluctuations.

 Conclusion 
Bitcoin's price action suggests a potential bullish reversal. However, it's important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and technical analysis should be used in conjunction with other factors when making trading decisions. By carefully analyzing the technical indicators and considering potential scenarios, traders can develop informed strategies to navigate the market.

btc to 72k, 40k then massive run to 130k with a blow off top. then we crash to 10k
Based on the monthly and weekly timeframes, I believe we will break the August low. A consolidation above the 65 level will invalidate shorts, but for now, we are seeing lower highs in a sideways movement.

If the markets react positively to the actual 0.25% rate hike, I expect the opposite reaction to the rhetoric that follows.
CRYPTOCAP:BTC  looks like it‚Äôs losing momentum with being overbought on stoch Rsi. My thesis is that price will drop to support around 58.5k, reset the stoch Rsi and then smash through 60k
I keep seeing people talk about the BTC price consolidating. 
It's not consolidating.
We're seeing a series of lower highs and lower low's, and there's really not much support until we hit $44k. 
Next buying range is between $38k and $44k in my opinion.

ETH is looking a little stronger; it wont fall as far, but BTC looks really weak here....
In this video, we dive deep into the current bearish market structure
Focusing also on ETH/BTC and Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). Understanding these key indicators is crucial for gauging the broader market trend and positioning yourself for potential moves ahead.

We‚Äôll start by breaking down ETH/BTC, analyzing the weakness in Ethereum‚Äôs price action relative to Bitcoin, and what this could mean for altcoins in general. Next, we‚Äôll examine the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which is showing a shift in capital allocation within the crypto space. This movement could signal Bitcoin's growing dominance as altcoins lag behind.

Lastly, we discuss two critical Bitcoin price targets: the near-term resistance at $44,000, and the potential downside scenario to $15,000. These levels could define the next big moves for Bitcoin and the overall market direction.

Make sure to watch until the end to get a complete picture of the market‚Äôs current state and how to navigate it!

üìö Welcome to the Educational Content Section of Our Channel: Technical Analysis Training
We aim to produce educational content in playlist format that will teach you technical analysis from A to Z. We will cover topics such as risk and capital management, Dow Theory, support and resistance, trends, market cycles, and more. These lessons are based on our experiences and the book The Handbook of Technical Analysis, as well as our learning and insights from the Trade City Pro channel.

üé®  What is Technical Analysis? 
Let‚Äôs talk a bit about technical analysis and patterns in life. Technical analysis is not a science; rather, it is an art. Therefore, there is no right or wrong in art. Instead, we apply rules we have created through experience in this lawless market.

üìä  Introduction to Dow Theory :  
Today, for the first part of our lessons, we will begin with Dow Theory, which was developed by American journalist Charles Dow. Many traders still use this method for analysis and trading.

üìë  Principles of Dow Theory :  
1 - The Averages Discount Everything (Not applicable to crypto)
2 - The Market Has Three Trends
3 - Trends Have Three Phases
4 - Trend Continues Until a Reversal is Confirmed
5 - The Averages Must Confirm Each Other
6 - Volume Confirms the Trend

üíµ  Principle 1: Price is All You Need 
Dow's theory operates based on the "Efficient Market Hypothesis," which assumes that the price of assets reflects all available information. In other words, this approach contrasts with behavioral economics. Factors like earning potential, competitive advantage, management competence‚Äîall are accounted for in the price, even if individuals do not know all the details. In more precise readings of this theory, even future events might be reflected in the current market price.

üìä  Principle 2: The Market Has Three Types of Trends 
According to Dow Theory, price movements in the market are trend-based, and these trends can be divided into three types:

1 - Primary Trend: This is the main movement of the market, dictating the long-term direction, and can last for years.

2 - Secondary Trends: These are corrective movements that run opposite to the primary trend. For instance, if the primary trend is bullish, the corrective trend will be bearish. These trends can last from weeks to months.

3- Minor Trends: These are the daily price fluctuations in the asset. Although minor trends can last for weeks, their direction will always align with the primary trend, even if they contradict the secondary trend.

üí°  Final Thoughts for Today : 
This is the end of this part, and I must say we have a long journey ahead. We will continually strive to produce better content every day, steering clear of sensationalized content that promises unrealistic profits, and instead, focusing on the proper learning path of technical analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please remember that these lessons represent our personal view of the market and should not be considered financial advice for investment.

#Bitcoin Update ‚Äì Wednesday, 11.09.2024

Assalamu Alaikum and good evening to all brothers and sisters,

#Bitcoin has closed the daily candle above our key resistance level marked by the black line on the daily time frame. However, today‚Äôs session has been somewhat bearish. On the 4-hour chart, we can observe that the price has just retested the support line (as shown by the black circle). In my opinion, the price still remains bullish.

What‚Äôs next?
If the price continues to hold within the current resistance zone and stays above support, the bullish trend could remain intact. However, if it breaks below the support level, we may see a reversal in the trend.

#ALTS Update
The altcoin market has shown mixed signals today. While some altcoins are performing well, others have experienced significant drops in line with Bitcoin‚Äôs pullback. Nonetheless, all of our signals in the group are performing well, Alhamdulillah.

I wish you all a very pleasant day ahead! Stay informed and trade wisely.
Hi Everyone 
There is another Short Opportunity for BTC , looks bearish to me 

Best of Luck
Hope everyone gets rich. Wishing everyone a great trading year. Q4 let‚Äôs go

The key is whether it can rise above the important section of 60672.0-61099.25.

However, if the StochRSI indicator is located below the overbought section and the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA continues, it is highly likely that it will eventually fall, so caution is required when trading.

If the price is maintained near the M-Signal indicator (above 59053.55) on the 1W chart, it is expected that there will be a challenge to rise above the 60672.0-61099.25 section again.

If it falls below 59053.55 this time, it is expected to fall to around 56K.

The reason is that the StochRSI indicator is likely to fall below 50.

-
We cannot tell how much the StochRSI indicator will rise or fall, but I think it tells us that there will be a change in the trend.

Therefore, the way to use the StochRSI indicator is:
- When the StochRSI indicator enters the overbought or oversold zone and a change in slope is detected

- When the StochRSI indicator intersects and is maintained with the StochRSI EMA indicator

We need to find a way to respond when the above two conditions are satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------------

(Example of how to draw and interpret a trend line)

If you look at the trend line from a short-term perspective, you can see that the low trend line and the high trend line intersect in an 'X' shape.

This shape appears when a trend change occurs.

The drawing of the trend line is
1. Low point trend line: Connect the low points when the StochRSI indicator makes the lowest point of the oversold zone.
2. High point trend line: Connect the high points when the StochRSI indicator makes the highest point of the overbought zone.

However, after making the lowest or highest point, it leaves the oversold or overbought zone and then enters the oversold or overbought zone again to make the lowest or highest point.

The intersection of the trend line drawn in this way and the support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts is likely to be a period of volatility.

However, you should be able to select an important point among the support and resistance points.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

Take the high and take the low. We are about to approach the red line. The middle of the range, which I think will serve as resistance. We could move to $61.4k by Wednesday, but the FOMC will shake the markets a bit then. On Friday, it will also be interesting to see if the Bank of Japan decides to raise rates.
BTC can touch the 48189 . it's a big support to make new high for 102000$.

üìä#BTC Bull Flagüìà

üß†From a structural point of view, the double top bearish structure at the weekly level is still intact, so the weekly level is a bearish trend, and its ideal target area still has a chance to be realized. We need to be alert to this possibility. If we can break through the turning point of 65,000, it means that the reversal structure of the same period will appear, and the double top bearish structure will most likely fail. If that happens, then we have a chance to challenge all-time highs.

‚û°Ô∏èFrom a graphical perspective, we have gone through a complex consolidation phase for about 6 months, and we can clearly see that the prototype of the bull flag has begun to take shape. I believe that it will not be long before we can see good performance again.

Btc will Go Down 
i may be wrong 
do your own  Research
Bitcoins has not been really moving above the range of  55k-62k  for a longer time now. Also Bitcoin broke below the crucial support at around  58k  and is currently getting rejected from it on the weekly chart.  I think the fed interest rate cut decision will be  extremely important  for Bitcoins midterm future. If the cut isn‚Äôt way higher than the expectations, Bitcoin will drop horribly. The decision could end the current bull market, furthermore because the strength of Bitcoin let loose a lot since the bit higher ATH.  Bitcoin could retrace to 32k-42k . But Bitcoin could also break above the lying above resistances and continue the Bullrun that could finish at  120k in April 2025 .

 Bullrun continuation probability: 60%
Bullrun ending probability 40%
if we are looking to go for a long then wait for the  r line breaks also wait for retest...
waiting for a breakout to trade long...since we saw a rejection from a support level....d1 chart is looking for a trend to break....if it breaks and closes above...we can go for long after retesting.
On a smaller timeframe, Bitcoin is now at the major EMA line, where this is the last zone to get the rejection from.

If everything plays just like we need, we should see a nice rejection from here.

The other scenario would be breaking from 200EMA and forming yet another fakeout like we had before (which would also touch 200EMA on the bigger timeframe of Daily).

It was a bit boring day, so I decided to have some fun here on top of the mountain. I got a bit sick probably because of the hights
Bitcoin has been putting is some near term lower highs and lower lows. 

The daily chart trend is starting to breakdown and show signs of distribution. 

The weekly chart trend is still ok but even if we had a flush to 40k the Weekly chart would still display higher lows. 

The point of this higher low excercise is to define trend and know that trends can often have a large range. 

That being said I think a short setup in BTC is brewing. a retest of the 50 & 100  MA will likely prove to be very strong resistance as we keep losing the key larger term MA's. 

As banks and potentially the stock market lose some momentum its going to be interesting to see how crypto is going to hold up.

Hello, everyone.

Today, I‚Äôm excited to share the second part of my educational series on chart patterns.

In this post, we‚Äôll be focusing on the 'Head and Shoulders' and 'Inverse Head and Shoulders' patterns.

 For those who missed the first part, you can catch up here: 
  ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì


As always, I‚Äôve kept the explanations simple and beginner-friendly. I hope this guide provides you with valuable insights!

Here‚Äôs today‚Äôs outline:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Inverse Head and Shoulders

  Examples
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


 1. What is the "Head and Shoulders" pattern? 

 1) Definition 
 The Head and Shoulders pattern is a well-established reversal formation that appears after an uptrend and signals the potential start of a downtrend. It indicates that buying pressure is weakening and selling pressure is gaining momentum. 

 2) Key components 
 
 Left Shoulder:  The initial peak, where the price rises and then pulls back.
 Head : The highest peak, situated between the two shoulders, representing the final bullish push.
 Right Shoulder:  The third peak, which is typically lower than the head but similar to the left shoulder, signaling diminishing buying interest.
 Neckline:  A key support line drawn across the lows of the left and right shoulders. A decisive break below this neckline confirms the reversal and the beginning of a downtrend.
 
 3) Characteristics 
 
 Reversal signal:  The Head and Shoulders pattern marks a transition from an uptrend to a downtrend.
 Easy identification:  The structure is visually distinctive, with three clear peaks.
 Neckline significance:  A break below the neckline serves as a confirmation signal for the downtrend.
 Volume dynamics:  Volume typically rises during the formation of the left shoulder and head, decreases during the right shoulder, and surges again when the neckline is breached.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


 2. Head and Shoulders (Reversal from uptrend to downtrend) 

 1) Basic features 
 End of an uptrend:  The Head and Shoulders pattern forms at the end of a bullish phase, signaling a weakening in buying strength.
 Distinct peak heights:  The head is always higher than the shoulders, which are generally symmetrical, though the right shoulder may sometimes be slightly lower, enhancing the pattern‚Äôs reliability.
 Neckline as a trigger:  The neckline acts as a critical support level. A break below it confirms the pattern and signals the onset of a bearish trend.
 Volume confirmation:  Volume increases during the left shoulder and head formations, weakens during the right shoulder, and spikes when the neckline is broken, confirming a potential sell-off.
 Price target:  After the pattern completes, the expected price drop is typically equal to the distance between the head and the neckline, providing traders with a target.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 In this example, we see a fakeout at the right shoulder, followed by a sharp decline. 
 After a brief retest of the neckline, the price broke through and continued its downtrend.
 


 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this chart, a fakeout occurred when the price dropped from the head and formed the neckline, misleading many market participants. After forming the right shoulder, the price successfully declined. There were two retests, which confirmed the reliability of the pattern.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Reverse Head and Shoulders (Trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend) 

 1) Basic features 
 End of a downtrend:  The Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern typically forms at the end of a downtrend, signaling a potential reversal to the upside.
 Formation of lows:  Like the standard Head and Shoulders, this pattern consists of three lows‚Äîleft shoulder, head, and right shoulder‚Äîwith the head being the lowest point.
 Neckline significance:  The neckline is drawn across the highs of the left and right shoulders. A break above this line confirms the reversal and acts as a strong buy signal.
 Volume pattern:  Volume tends to decrease during the formation of the pattern but surges when the neckline is broken, signaling strong buying momentum.
 Target setting:  After the pattern is confirmed, the expected price rise is often equal to the distance from the head to the neckline, which helps traders set profit targets.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 After the Head and Shoulders pattern formed, the price broke above the neckline, successfully reversing the downtrend into an uptrend. A buy strategy would have yielded profits at the breakout point.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this example, a smaller Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern formed within the head of a larger pattern (see Example 3). After two successful retests, the price reversed into a strong uptrend.
 

 2-3) Example 3 

 
 This example showcases the smaller Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern mentioned in Example 2, located within the head. After two successful retests, a buy strategy could have led to profits as the price reversed into an uptrend.
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Conclusion 

 "Charts are the maps of the market." 

 The Head and Shoulders and Reverse Head and Shoulders patterns we‚Äôve covered in this post are key signals that frequently appear in the market. Charts aren‚Äôt random‚Äîthey are visual representations of market psychology and investor behavior. As traders, our role is to interpret these maps, navigate the market, and make informed decisions.

Investing is more than just buying and selling. Sometimes the market may move contrary to our expectations, while other times we seize opportunities and achieve success. Each experience is a chance to learn and grow. The more experience you gain, the more paths you‚Äôll recognize on the chart.

Success in this market requires persistence, patience, and continuous learning. Understanding and analyzing chart patterns like the ones discussed here is just the beginning. I hope this post has helped you gain a deeper understanding of the market and make more informed decisions.

The market is always evolving, but within that evolution lies opportunity. The key is developing the ability to spot those opportunities. With knowledge, experience, and confidence, you‚Äôll find greater success.

Stay prepared, and always listen to what the market is telling you.
I am aware that BTC is totally bullish on MTFs ( Monthly, Weekly, Daily ) but I will not be surprised if bearish momentum kick in upcoming days when ( if ) price reaches to Daily POIs which marked on the chart. $62.700 - $65.000 and $67.000 - $70.100 are two good supply zones to look for sells targeting down to $48.800 min.
Bitcoin has reached again the line of 100EMA, where historically we have had pretty good rejections. 

We are looking to get another rejection from here and a possible further downward movement toward $50K. 

But if somehow we break the EMAs, then there is a chance to see another fakeout form.

Understanding the Business Cycle and the Strategic Importance of Holding Bitcoin Through Economic Phases 

The four phases of the business cycle‚ÄîEarly Expansion, Maturing Expansion, Late Expansion, and Recession‚Äîeach play a crucial role in shaping economic activities, investment trends, and asset performances. For those engaged in crypto trading and investment, particularly within the Global Miranda Miner Research Group, it's essential to understand how Bitcoin fits into these phases and why holding onto Bitcoin, especially during the Recession phase, can be a strategic move.

Early Expansion: The Foundation of Growth
The Early Expansion phase is marked by the economy's recovery from a recession. During this phase, employment rates start to rise, business profits increase, and consumer confidence is restored. This period is characterized by heightened investments in sectors like Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Industrials, Information Technology, and Real Estate. Notably, Bitcoin, as a technology-driven asset, tends to attract investors looking for growth opportunities in innovative markets.

Coach Miranda Miner, a respected figure in cryptocurrency education, emphasizes the importance of recognizing Bitcoin's potential during this phase. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group highlights that as investor sentiment shifts towards growth and innovation, Bitcoin's role as a pioneering asset becomes more prominent. Those who invest in Bitcoin during the Early Expansion phase can potentially benefit from its growth trajectory as the economy continues to strengthen.

Maturing Expansion: The Peak of Economic Growth
As the economy moves into the Maturing Expansion phase, growth reaches its peak. Inflation pressures begin to emerge, and the economic environment becomes more complex. Investment strategies typically shift towards sectors such as Communication Services, Financials, Industrials, Information Technology (including Bitcoin), and Real Estate.

According to insights from the Global Miranda Miner Research Group, this phase is a critical juncture for Bitcoin investors. Coach Miranda Miner advises that while the market may experience volatility due to inflation concerns, Bitcoin's inherent properties‚Äîsuch as its limited supply and decentralized nature‚Äîposition it as a potential hedge against inflation. Investors within the crypto community are encouraged to maintain their Bitcoin holdings during this phase, as it can serve as a safeguard against traditional market fluctuations.

Late Expansion: Navigating Slowdowns and Strategic Positioning
The Late Expansion phase is characterized by a slowdown in economic growth. Interest rates may rise in response to inflationary pressures identified during the Maturing Expansion phase. During this period, investments often shift towards more defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Energy, Financials, Health Care, Materials, and Real Estate.

For Bitcoin investors, this phase requires a strategic approach. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group suggests that while traditional markets may start to feel the strain of rising interest rates, Bitcoin‚Äôs unique attributes could provide a buffer. Coach Miranda Miner points out that as economic conditions become more uncertain, holding Bitcoin can serve as a valuable counterbalance to more traditional assets, potentially offering protection against economic slowdowns.

Recession: The Opportunity to Accumulate and Hold
The Recession phase, where economic activity contracts, is often viewed with apprehension by investors. Jobs may be eliminated, and interest rates typically begin to decline as the economy attempts to stabilize. During this phase, investments generally focus on defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples, Energy, Health Care, and Utilities.

However, the Global Miranda Miner Research Group views the Recession phase as a prime opportunity for Bitcoin accumulation. Coach Miranda Miner strongly advocates for holding Bitcoin through this phase, emphasizing that historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience during economic downturns. The Recession phase often leads to a flight to safety, where investors seek assets that are less correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized and finite nature, stands out as a potential store of value in these uncertain times.

The Strategic Importance of Holding Bitcoin
Across all phases of the business cycle, the consistent theme promoted by Coach Miranda Miner and the Global Miranda Miner Research Group is the importance of holding Bitcoin. While the Early Expansion and Maturing Expansion phases may present opportunities for growth and profits, it is during the Late Expansion and Recession phases that the strategic value of Bitcoin becomes more apparent.

Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to act as a hedge against inflation, its independence from central bank policies, and its limited supply make it a unique asset in an investor's portfolio. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group advises that by maintaining a long-term perspective and holding Bitcoin through various economic cycles, investors can position themselves to benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs potential appreciation, particularly in post-recession recoveries.

Coach Miranda Miner often underscores the value of patience and conviction in cryptocurrency investment. The cyclical nature of the economy suggests that downturns are followed by recoveries. Investors who hold Bitcoin during challenging economic periods are often rewarded when the economy rebounds, and Bitcoin‚Äôs value appreciates in response to renewed investor confidence.

Conclusion: Navigating the Business Cycle with Bitcoin
Understanding the four phases of the business cycle is essential for any investor, particularly those involved in the cryptocurrency space. For members of the Global Miranda Miner Research Group and followers of Coach Miranda Miner, recognizing the strategic importance of holding Bitcoin through these phases is crucial. While each phase presents its own set of challenges and opportunities, the consistent advice is clear: Bitcoin, with its unique characteristics, should be held as a long-term asset.

By embracing this strategy, investors can potentially safeguard their portfolios against economic uncertainties and position themselves to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs growth as the economy moves through its cycles. In the words of Coach Miranda Miner, "In the world of crypto, patience is a virtue, and holding Bitcoin through the storm often leads to brighter days

Buckle up, dear humans. If the stars align, or more accurately, if the charts, whales, and market dynamics align, Bitcoin might indeed be setting its coordinates for the $40,000s. But in the grand cosmic joke that is the market, always be prepared for a plot twist. Here's to hoping your digital wallets are ready for the ride, whether it's to the moon or just a scenic tour around the current orbit.

As you can see in the chart, after breaking the Triangle, the price fell to the support zone, and from now on, the price can follow the butterfly pattern and go up. Maybe...

 As I Wrote yesterday we had to wait till price dip down to the DP.i point of interest box.
then we got a confirmation signal to get into a buy position.
as you see my chart, we have a SCOB type confirmation signal.
then we can buy here on a 2.6 Risk to Reward (R/R) position.
 
Hope you enjoy the ride..

I will update Bitcoin regularly..

#BTC #Crypto
September is not historically a great month for BTC, but occasionally it does great, if 2024 be the case, BTC sure gonna reaches ATH still this year.
I took a long shot at the level where there was the most volume in this bitcoin uptrend. First Tp has already been hit. We can move sideways, up or down. let's see what will happen.

I leave it to the market to determine what the price will do.
By analyzing the #Bitcoin chart on the weekly timeframe, we can see that over the past two weeks, the price dropped from $65,000 to $52,500 and is currently trading around $54,400. If the price remains below $57,870, we will likely see further declines in Bitcoin. The potential targets for this drop are $50,750, $49,000, and $44,100. After a short corrective wave, we may witness a significant upward move in Bitcoin, with targets above $80,000.

 Please support me with your likes and comments to motivate me to share more analysis with you and share your opinion about the possible trend of this chart with me !

It seems that funds are flowing into the coin market through USDT or USDC.


We need to check if the USDT dominance can fall below 5.55.

If not, the key is whether it can meet resistance near 5.89.

-

Looking at the NAS100USD chart, it rose to the important point of 19582.6.

The key is whether it can rise above 19582.6 and receive support.

If not, we need to check whether it can receive support near 19143.2 in the first round.

-------------------------------

** Information on support and resistance zones is explained in the previous idea.

(BTCUSDT 1D chart)

I think this volatility period has just begun because it was set on the 1W chart.

This volatility period is expected to continue until September 29, so caution is required when trading.

-
It is rising near 60672.0-61099.25.

The important thing now is whether the price can be maintained above the M-Signal indicator on the 1W chart.

To do so, the key is whether it can rise above 61099.25 and receive support.

-
Since the StochRSI indicator has changed its slope in the overbought zone, it appears to be currently forming a high point.

Therefore, even if the price rises, a pullback pattern may occur, so we need to think about a response plan for this.

Therefore, whether there is support around 60672.0-61099.25 has become important.

Since the sell line of the superTrend indicator is formed around 60672.0, it highlights the importance of the 60672.0-61099.25 range.

-
If a pullback pattern is shown, the key is whether it can receive support around the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator and rise.

Accordingly, we need to check whether the price can be maintained above 57889.10.

-
If it rises above 61099.25, it is important to see whether it can break through the 63118.62-64000.0 range.

If it fails to break through, it will form a high point and fall like after July 15.

At this time, if the price is maintained above the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator, there is a high possibility that it will turn into an upward trend.

-
I am talking about analyzing the BTCUSDT chart with several charts.

This is because I think that the fund flow in the coin market can be briefly judged by the movement of USDT, USDC and the flow of the stock market according to the launch of the ETF.

I think that it can be used to check whether the current support and resistance zone of BTC is supported based on the identified fund flow.


I think the Renko chart that I sometimes show you is excellent for checking support and resistance zones and trends.

However, since it is difficult to trade through the Renko chart, I think it is good to use it for checking trends or support and resistance zones.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin when it rises above 29K.

The section that is expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41

4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

Hello everyone!

  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  We can see that the recent decline is continuing, which is consistent with the breakout from the bullish channel that I outlined earlier.

Therefore, today I will focus on selling and targeting lower profit levels.
After the long and short played out exactly as I thought. Can we now look further into an outbreak? Whether this is downwards or upwards, it does not matter. I think from experience that if we close a 4 hour candle below the 59656.7 level. that you are more likely to make a move down. If we close a 4-hour candle above the 60366.2 level, I expect that there is a greater chance that we will go higher. The last option is that we continue to move sideways. However, I think it is less likely that a long or short at the same level entails a greater risk. That's why I'm waiting for myself or one of the moves I just mentioned.

I leave it to the market to determine what the price will do.
Hi 
There is some sellers  gonna be quick sell opportunity for BTC ... 
But i be quickly in and out again !

I wasn't even looking at Bitcoin but opened this chart to check some numbers in relation to ETCBTC, which is ultra-bullish right now and what do I see?

Bitcoin just lost ALL support on the weekly timeframe.

There is only the wick from the 5-Aug. week that's been lower since February. Bearish bias, bearish potential, bearish continuation confirmed for the 300th time.

What is happening is nothing new. This is something that has been in the making for the past six months. Bitcoin gave the first massive, impossible to ignore signal on the 5th of March, six months ago, with the highest bearish volume session on the daily timeframe in years.

The action has been bearish, sideways, down, lower highs and lower lows... The chart tells us the tendency, the market will make up the event that will be the catalyst that produces the crash that we've been seeing developing for so long.

‚ûñ What to make of this situation?
‚ûñ Where do go we from here?
‚ûñ What about Crypto?

This is a positive situation. We are seeing the natural workings of the market first hand. The market grows and shrinks. Money flowing out of Bitcoin will reach other portions of the market and all is well. Everything is as it should be and life is good.

From here, we move to the Altcoins. We enjoy the Altcoins and profit from their rise as Bitcoin crashes. When Bitcoin hits bottom, we can either move back to Bitcoin or continue with the Altcoins, but, when the bottom is hit, the opportunity to buy again presents itself. Better prices, more people, new participants will join. All the gambling, all the weak-hands, all these things will be "corrected," erased, removed from the market and only those that are ready for the long-term will stay in the game. This is again positive, there has always been corrections and corrections will continue to exist for as long as we humans live in a world of duality with good and bad, night and day, left and right, pleasure and pain. This is exactly what the market does. Energy from the moon (down), energy from the sun (up).

Crypto as a whole is becoming better. Crypto as a whole is evolving. What about Crypto?
Cryptocurrency is doing great and will continue to do great. The Cryptocurrency market is evolving and will continue to evolve.

Think of the 2022 bear-market. When Bitcoin crashes, everything crashes. Bitcoin would only hint at moving lower and everything would be down 20-30%. Now we are seeing the lowest prices in months and many pairs are staying strong, ready to move ahead.

Imagine billions upon billions moving from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin, Tron and the rest, to the smaller Altcoins, what do you think will happen? A major bullish wave.

So, when one side of the market is depressed, the other side can grow. We are here, we are adults, we are advanced, we are smart; we can see this dynamic and instead of letting our Bitcoins lose value, we can take action and profit all day long.

‚ûñ What action to take now?
‚ûñ How to survive the correction?

Sell the pairs that are trading high. High can be those trading near March 2024 prices or February 2024 or near their recent peak. Those are no good, for now. Sell those.

Buy those trading low. Low can be those trading near a strong support. Can be a support that is 1 year old, 2-3 years old, etc.

Buy those trading at All-Time Lows or those trading near their October/September 2023 low/support. These are good now and set to grow.

The Tether (USDT) pairs are risky no matter how they look. They will crash when Bitcoin crashes. Period.

The Bitcoin (BTC) pairs are the only way to succeed at this point. Plenty of time we had to take action, plenty of time to prepare. There is still time now because, while Bitcoin has been going down, some of these Altcoins, most of them, are still at their lowest level in 3,4,5 or 6 years; it can't get any better than this. These will grow long-term and it will be a win-win-win.

‚ûñ What happens if you are wrong?

This is not financial advice.

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Namaste.

Buying Bitcoin (BTC) with a target of $70,000 implies that you expect the price to rise significantly from its current level. Here are some key points to consider:

- Current Price: Check the current price of BTC to determine how much it needs to increase to reach your target.
- Market Trends: Understand the current market trends, sentiment, and factors influencing BTC's price.
- Technical Analysis: Look at technical indicators, charts, and patterns to identify potential support and resistance levels.
- target $70000
Bitcoin‚Äôs Bullish Momentum is Losing Ground‚Äî60% Bullish vs. 40% Bearish Probability

The bullish case for Bitcoin has weakened slightly due to several conflicting signals across different timeframes. Here's the breakdown:

Bullish Factors:

  
üö´ Monthly PCL disrespected
‚úÖ Monthly Bullish FVG respected

  
üö´ Weekly swing low disrespected
‚úÖ Weekly Bullish FVG respected

  
‚úÖ Daily Bullish FVG respected
üö´ 4H swing low disrespected
üö´ 4H swing low swept
Bearish Factors:

  
‚úÖ Daily swing low respected
‚úÖ Daily swing high respected
‚úÖ Daily Bearish FVG respected
üö´ Daily Bullish FVG disrespected (so far)
Given the mixed arguments, it‚Äôs crucial to wait for further confirmation before making any moves. Strong economic factors expected this week could shift the market. Don‚Äôt get liquidated‚Äîpatience is key! üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Master it to stay profitable. üèÜ
After a significant downtrend, The market is in a consolidation phase between 56,000 USDT (support) and 60,000 USDT (resistance). The price shows signs of indecision around 58,750 USDT, awaiting a breakout. A break above 60,000 USDT could trigger a bullish move toward 62,000 USDT, while a break below 56,000 USDT might lead to further downside towards 52,000 USDT.
The Bitcoin is expected to form a Harmonic Butterfly pattern at the price level of 62,000. In a more optimistic scenario, if the upper limit of the Butterfly pattern is exceeded, we could see a rally up to 67,330
This is it, how do you determine bearishness, when the bot you hope will hold is now your top you hope will break, in this case is 58300

This is even reinforced by the break of the major yellow trend which we now find an bear AADI, that is what I call support break resistance, exactly what we see here, A SUPPORT ON THE TRENDLINE, A BREAK OF IT, A REISTANCE ON IT. 

CETERIS PARIBUS THE MARKET SHOULD DROP FASTER THAN YOU CAN BUY. 

CONSIDER THAT TRENDLINE IS UPWARDS SO MORE PRESSURE ON BULLS TO KEEP UP

INVALIDATION IS SUPPORT ON 59400 AND A BREAK FROM THE BLUE DOWNWARD LINES THAT CAN EXPLODE BTC TO ATHs.

Sneak peak, notice the blue,red,yellow meetup point. Interesting.

In 1980, the Hunt brothers set off a financial earthquake, driving the price of silver from $6 an ounce to a jaw-dropping $50. At their peak, Nelson and William Hunt controlled over a third of the world‚Äôs privately owned silver, igniting a frenzy that reverberated throughout the financial world.

Their story began quietly in the early 1970s. With a vast oil fortune behind them, the Hunts grew increasingly concerned about rising inflation and a faltering U.S. dollar. They saw silver as a reliable investment that could safeguard their wealth and potentially yield enormous profits.

What started as cautious buying quickly escalated into a full-scale market takeover. From 1973 to 1979, the brothers amassed an astonishing 100 million ounces of silver. This massive accumulation sparked a rush among other investors, driving silver prices to unprecedented heights. By January 1980, silver had surged to nearly $50 an ounce, and the Hunts stood at the pinnacle of market power.

But their dominance was short-lived. As their influence grew, regulators took notice and introduced new rules and higher margin requirements. The Hunts, now heavily leveraged and unable to meet these new demands, faced a critical situation. On March 27, 1980‚ÄîSilver Thursday‚Äîthe market crashed, with silver prices plummeting by over 50% in a single day.

The aftermath was catastrophic. The Hunts were forced to liquidate their massive silver holdings, triggering a market panic that led to billions in losses. Once the kings of silver, the brothers found themselves bankrupt and disgraced, their audacious attempt to control the market ending in dramatic failure.
When the BTCUSDT 4-hour chart is examined; It is observed that the price movements continue on the trend line with the formation of the Inverse Head and Shoulders Formation. As long as the crypto's level of 55554 is not broken down, it is evaluated that the price movements above the level of 58753 can exceed the level of 65022 and target the level of 69969.
Hello Traders!
What are your thoughts on BITCOIN ?


BTCUSDT
get ready for a big move now.  I believe Bitcoin price can reach 65K soon and even more.

How can we take this trade?   I'd showed you the best entry to take this trade on the chart.  take the trade only if BIG VOLUME appeared on the chart,  Otherwise there is a chance that price go even lower.

Good luck !

üÜïIt's certainly concerning to see BlackRock, a financial giant, experience its first outflow from its Bitcoin Trust. This could indeed exert downward pressure on Bitcoin's price, especially in the short term, as it may signal a shift in sentiment among institutional investors.

‚≠êHowever, it's important to consider the broader context. While BlackRock's outflow is notable, other major asset managers are still seeing inflows. Furthermore, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond short-term capital flows.

‚≠êFor instance, developments like the partnership between Merlin Chain and BitcoinOS, aimed at improving network scalability and efficiency, could significantly bolster Bitcoin's long-term prospects. Such advancements have the potential to drive increased demand and adoption.

‚úÖUltimately, while short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, it's crucial to maintain a long-term perspective. Technical analysis, combined with a deep understanding of fundamental factors, can provide valuable insights into Bitcoin's future price movements. The market will ultimately decide, and it's wise to stay informed and adapt to evolving market dynamics

üíéDaily #Bitcoin Analysis
üöÄIn our previous analysis, we predicted a bullish move from the weekly timeframe channel's bottom, which successfully occurred, reaching our initial target of 57877.90‚úÖü§ë

‚ö†Ô∏èAs previously mentioned, this target represents a significant resistance level (daily timeframe pivot: monthly resistance)‚ùóÔ∏è

‚úÖContinuation of the bullish-Trend Scenario:
If the 57877.90 resistance is breached on the daily time-frame, we anticipate further growth towards targets of 63002.85, 66755.85, and ultimately 74537.70üöÄ

‚úÖLower Price Entry Scenario:
Given the strong resistance at the monthly level, a pullback is possible before a breakout.
However, if a correction occurs, we remain bullish and expect #Bitcoin to find support at one of the following levelsüëá
55743.20 (weekly support), 51676.75-52489.40, or 48483.55-50096.10, from which it can resume its upward trajectory towards the aforementioned targets

‚ùåStop-Loss for the Bullish Scenario: Our bullish view would only be invalidated if a weekly candle closes below 49000.00üîªüîª
üîÑIn such a case, we will provide an updated analysisüßê

...............................
üíé#Bitcoin Analysis: ‚è±4-Hour Timeframe

üìåBased on the price touching the daily pivot point (monthly resistance) and the subsequent temporary weakness:

üëâIf the price breaks down on the 4-hour timeframe due to this contact and reaches the support zone of 55059.97 - 55743.20:
üí∞We can use the formation of a head and shoulders pattern to determine the subsequent direction of movement on this timeframe.

‚úÖbullish scenario: If the price reaches the mentioned support zone, bounces, and breaks above the neck-line of the head and shoulders pattern, it confirms a continuation of the uptrend from this area.

‚úÖtemporary bearish scenario: If the 4-hour timeframe breaks below the head and shoulders pattern, it indicates a continuation of the bear-trend towards the second and third support levels of the main analysis. The price is expected to attempt to form a bottom at one of these support levels.


üíé4-Hour Timeframe Analysis(
‚ùóÔ∏èThere is also a possibility of a temporary rally to the resistance zone of 58556.01 - 58936.40, followed by a decline to the support zone of 55059.97 - 55743.20.

‚úÖIn this scenario, the head and shoulders pattern should be drawn with a positive slope, and we would wait for a breakout below the lower boundry or above the upper boundry to signal a temporary decline or a continuation of the growth.

‚ùåThis scenario remains valid until a significant breakout above the monthly #Bitcoin resistance occurs, which would confirm the continuation of the bull-trend from this level on the daily timeframe.
In today's analysis of Bitcoin, we talked about its most important resistance, which is currently facing this resistance. 
If this important resistance is broken, we can see Bitcoin grow in the first step to 70,000, which we discussed in this video about how to reach this price. 
On the other hand, we examined Dominance Tether in this analysis and talked about the fact that nothing special has happened yet because Dominance Tether is still on its support. 
We talked about today's news, what effect it will have on Bitcoin and the possible movement of Bitcoin in the next 24 hours.
BINANCE:BTCUSDT 

WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

OBVIUSLY, it's not confirmed, but the price is printing a pretty nice moviment in the chart.
Just as predicted, #BTC started to drop from the identified zone and crossed below the trendline. Over the past 24 hours, it has dropped by 5% so far.

The first stop for this dump is probably in 55,000 - 56,000 zone.
BTC USDT
D.Tether is in an ascending channel and has a rise again for the ceiling of the channel, which causes a 10% BTC
target  BTC 52K ...
Bitcoin has broken the falling trend channel in the short term and reacted strongly up. For the time being, it is difficult to say anything about the future trend direction. The currency is approaching support at 58000 points, which may give a positive reaction. However, a break downwards through 58000 points will be a negative signal. The currency is assessed as technically neutral for the short term.
Price action has been crab walking for the past 6 months. this broadening wedge has been violently tested through the blue resistance and purple support lines. We can only say we are still in a bull market if price manages to break and close above the blue resistance trend line. breaking down and closing below the purple support line imo is an indication of a bear market. for now we have had a nice reversal pattern formed, but reversal patterns can be deceptive sometimes if higher highs are not seen in price action,

For hours  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  moves near the VAH. I think BTC is ready for a big move to 61500 and even more.

Right now there is no entry for taking Long position but in case  BINANCE:BTCUSDT   reach the VAL and Volume increased, then I say it is a good opportunity to open Long position.

Be careful guys, Opening position in this scenario is risky.

Greetings traders!

Using inverted charts can be useful to avoid being too biased, and see things from a different prospective.

There's many bears out there that refuse to see a possible BTC bull flag/bullish consolidation.

I bet they won't hesitate to call this a bear flag ready to continue down.
There is a strong horizontal level being retested from beneath, and the price seems to be rejecting.
There is no major higher high, and the price is still capped below the trendline.
Everything points to bearish continuation.

Back to regular chart, it goes without saying, if BTC breaks that trendline and makes new lower low, it would be very, very bearish. For real.

Good luck everyone!
hello trader's
here is your new update that you will miss 
so don't wait go and share and follow that page
It's totally new for all of you only
Macro Overview

Easier withdrawal options have kept Bitcoin balances on exchanges stable, signaling investor hesitation near key levels. Miner transfers to exchanges have hit their lowest point of the year, while illiquid supply has increased, reflecting a lack of selling intent. Investors in ARKB are leading the way in spot Bitcoin ETF purchases.

Technical Analysis

BTCUSD corrected to 55,650 before retesting 57,800. The price remains within an upward channel and above both EMAs, indicating continued bullish momentum. If BTCUSD extends its rise beyond 57,800, it may retest the psychological level of 60,000. On the other hand, if BTCUSD pulls back before continuing upward, it may correct to around 56,500.
BTC is set for another down trend . watch closely for better sell opportunity if all confirmations hold

The key is whether it can rise above the important section of 60672.0-61099.25.

However, if the StochRSI indicator is located below the overbought section and the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA continues, it is highly likely that it will eventually fall, so caution is required when trading.

If the price is maintained near the M-Signal indicator (above 59053.55) on the 1W chart, it is expected that there will be a challenge to rise above the 60672.0-61099.25 section again.

If it falls below 59053.55 this time, it is expected to fall to around 56K.

The reason is that the StochRSI indicator is likely to fall below 50.

-
We cannot tell how much the StochRSI indicator will rise or fall, but I think it tells us that there will be a change in the trend.

Therefore, the way to use the StochRSI indicator is:
- When the StochRSI indicator enters the overbought or oversold zone and a change in slope is detected

- When the StochRSI indicator intersects and is maintained with the StochRSI EMA indicator

We need to find a way to respond when the above two conditions are satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------------

(Example of how to draw and interpret a trend line)

If you look at the trend line from a short-term perspective, you can see that the low trend line and the high trend line intersect in an 'X' shape.

This shape appears when a trend change occurs.

The drawing of the trend line is
1. Low point trend line: Connect the low points when the StochRSI indicator makes the lowest point of the oversold zone.
2. High point trend line: Connect the high points when the StochRSI indicator makes the highest point of the overbought zone.

However, after making the lowest or highest point, it leaves the oversold or overbought zone and then enters the oversold or overbought zone again to make the lowest or highest point.

The intersection of the trend line drawn in this way and the support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts is likely to be a period of volatility.

However, you should be able to select an important point among the support and resistance points.

Have a good time.
Thank you.

Accounting for manipulation to the upside, the general sentiment from the crypto as a whole is bearish so anticipating a relief rally before a continued sell-off into $50,000 seems reasonable right??
BTC price has been in an uptrend after the release of CpI news of Wednesday, Invalidating my Short setups just the day before. As I said their was a Bullish setup which I didn't really take serious because I hadn't gotten the confirmations I needed as the time.
Even though I still took them, hit SL and reentered again

Also these are the results of my short trades, even though both the short setups hit SL ' closed 1 earlier' which is part of trading as we know it.
Hello trader's
here is new update that you when you don't follow my page
so go and follow both page for learning 
and comment if you want any analysis of any other coin or other markets..
The bullrun started in November 2022 - and has been increasing in price ever since.

It has been following the Fib Speed Resistance Fan along the .382 perfectly since then, only briefly dropping below, but never more than 7%... 

I would say, After nearly two years of following this, This is a fairly perfect "Floor" line to follow.

Between March and October 2023, We had 216 days of consolidation before a major pump to the upside, So far, Between March 2024 and today, we have had 191 days of consolidation, Leaving a rough estimate of 25 more days before we could get a major move to the upside (If history repeats)...

We are in a descending parallel channel, Bouncing off the bottom, Once again - Off the .382 Fib Speed fan... We have an Inverse H+S Forming, disguised cleverly, within this channel.

We have formed a beautiful Long term C+H, from the previous Bullrun cycle, with a handle down to  GETTEX:49K , giving us a target of $100k Bitcoin

Everything is bullish here, and it is screaming to let rip. But are you?
Hi guys, this is my overview for BTCUSDT, feel free to check it and write your feedback in commentsüëä

Recently price entered to rising channel, where it rose until to resistance line, breaking $64400 level.

Next, price turned around and made downward impulse to $49000 points, breaking two levels and exiting from rising channel.

After this, price started to trades inside pennant, where it at once bounced up from support line.

Price broke $55300 level and later rose to resistance line of pennant, which coincided with resistance level.

But a not long time ago BTC bounced and fell to support line, where at the moment continues to trades near.

Now, I think price can bounce from this line to $61600, exiting from pennant pattern.

FOLLOW MM And RM
Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a critical zone as it struggles to hold above the $57,000 support level. The daily chart suggests that the cryptocurrency is losing momentum, with multiple technical indicators pointing towards a potential bearish breakdown.

### 1. **Price Action and Key Levels:**
   - Bitcoin is currently trading at **57,776 USDT**, down **2.29%** in the latest session. The price has ranged between **59,210 USDT** (high) and **57,493 USDT** (low), reflecting increasing selling pressure.
   - The price has failed to break through the strong resistance around **60,000 USDT**, and the downward sloping trendline indicates that sellers are controlling the market.

### 2. **EMAs Acting as Resistance:**
   - BTC is trading below all key EMAs (20/50/100/200), indicating that the bulls are losing control in both short- and long-term trends. The **20-day EMA** (58,323 USDT) is acting as immediate resistance, followed by the **50-day EMA** (59,523 USDT). The price consistently failing to reclaim these levels reflects persistent bearish sentiment.

### 3. **Descending Trendline Pressure:**
   - A clear **descending trendline** is visible on the chart, connecting recent highs. BTC has been unable to break this trendline, suggesting continued downward pressure and potential for further declines. This trendline acts as a psychological barrier for the bulls, preventing any significant breakout.

### 4. **Support Levels and Bearish Targets:**
   - The key support at **57,000 USDT** is being tested. A break below this level could lead to a sharper decline, with the next major support resting around **49,024 USDT**, which coincides with a previous consolidation zone. Traders should be cautious of a close below this support, as it could signal a prolonged bearish phase.

### 5. **RSI and Momentum:**
   - The **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** is currently at **47.34**, suggesting neutral momentum but edging closer to oversold territory. This indicates that while Bitcoin is not yet in an oversold condition, a continuation of the current trend could push the RSI below **40**, confirming further downside risk.

### 6. **Volume and Market Sentiment:**
   - The **volume** sits at **24.775K**, which is relatively low. This implies that the current move down might not yet have the momentum of a full-scale sell-off, but if selling volume picks up, it could accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs decline towards lower support levels.

---

### **Conclusion:**
Bitcoin is at a crossroads, with key support levels in danger of being breached. If the price fails to hold above **57,000 USDT**, the next target could be **49,024 USDT**. The inability to break through key EMAs and the descending trendline further signals a bearish outlook. Traders should keep an eye on volume and RSI levels to gauge the strength of the selling pressure. A breakdown could signal a prolonged bearish trend, while a bounce from these levels would provide temporary relief.
Bitcoin buy side analysis got SL 20 pips yesterday 
Due to volatile momentum SL hit and ran out towards the profit side
Hello everyone, let's look at the current BTC situation considering the one hour interval.  In this situation, we can see how the price has moved higher from the local downtrend line above which it remains.
  Let's start by setting goals for the near future, which include:
T1- 60252$
T2- 62340$
T3- 64922$
  Now let's move on to the stop-loss in case the market continues to decline:
  SL1 = $58,076
  SL2 = $56,190
  SL3 = $555,256 AND
  SL4 = $54,044

  Looking at the RSI indicator, we see a movement at the upper limit, which may influence an attempt to recover or give a temporary sideways trend.
Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken
Volume slowed down as we went higher. HTF is printing hidden bear divs. Only 4hr is bullish MS wise. Although the daily could be considered as well.
Volume slowed down as we went higher. HTF is printing hidden bear divs. Only 4hr is bullish MS wise. Although the daily could be considered as well.
I think bulls want to keep grinding up here, or at least defend 56k region if we retest it.

Going below 55.5-56k, we have some untested npocs, but there is not a lot volume to support price there, so I would wait for 53.6k or 52.5 before considering being a buyer.

If bulls are successful and keep momentum going, I think 60-61k is going to be an interesting area to watch. It has proven to be a pivotal level, with almost no volume traded at 60k but decent HVN right above and right below it.
Hello, this is full-time trader full_time_trader88.

Here‚Äôs the Bitcoin market analysis for September 10.

Let‚Äôs dive right in.




 (Ascending Channel Perspective)

üî¥ Ascending Channel 1 

This is the first short-term ascending channel (pink).
 Bitcoin has broken out to the upside and even completed a support retest.

The price was already trending upwards within the channel, but this breakout further solidifies the bullish outlook.

 üîµ Ascending Channel 2 

This is another smaller ascending channel, which has also broken to the upside‚Äîanother positive indicator.

As long as these ascending channels hold, the overall trend remains bullish.





 (Descending Channel Perspective)

üü† Descending Channel 

This descending channel had been in place for about a week. After breaking down through the lower boundary, Bitcoin has rebounded and is now testing the upper resistance.

Currently, it‚Äôs facing resistance for the third time.
A breakout from this channel would be a significant move.




 (Both Channels Together) 

Here‚Äôs what the combined view of both the ascending and descending channels looks like.





 (Bollinger Bands Perspective)

üî¥ Lower Bollinger Band Break 

Recently, the candles broke below the lower Bollinger Band.

Historically, when this occurs, the price tends to rebound towards the middle band, and it has done so recently.

Given this pattern, we can expect a potential rise to the middle Bollinger Band,
currently sitting at $58.9K.





 (Angle Perspective)

üîµ Gradual Decline Followed by a Steep Drop 

If you observe recent downtrends, they tend to begin with a gradual decline before accelerating sharply, which often marks the bottom.

The early September drop follows a similar pattern, suggesting we may be in a potential bottoming area.

In such cases, Bitcoin has historically rebounded beyond the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. For the recent drop, this would take us above $60K, indicating a possible short-term rally to that level‚Äîan encouraging signal.

(Of course, no chart pattern guarantees certainty.)





 (Symmetrical Triangle Perspective)

üü£ Mid-sized Symmetrical Triangle 

This is a mid-sized symmetrical triangle spanning 43 days.

As it hasn‚Äôt broken out yet, it could potentially extend to a 50‚Äì60 day consolidation period.

This is one of the largest symmetrical triangles we‚Äôve seen this year.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Volume 

The volume within the triangle is inconsistent, making the pattern less reliable.
However, due to its size, I‚Äôm watching it closely.





 (Large Descending Channel Perspective)

üü¢ Large Descending Channel 

This large descending channel has been in place for about six months, dating back to March 2024.

Bitcoin has stayed within this channel throughout, with every candle contained inside. It‚Äôs quite a persistent structure.

The recent bottom coincided with a bounce off the lower boundary of this channel, making it a key support level.

(Previous attempts to break below were unsuccessful, as the daily close remained inside the channel. The daily close is, therefore, an important indicator.)






 (Major Support Zone Perspective)

üü£ Consolidation Before a Major Rally 

Historically, Bitcoin consolidated for around 10 days before a 50% rally.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Major Support Zone (50.5‚Äì53.0K) 

I‚Äôve highlighted a rectangular box at this consolidation area, which now serves as a major support zone.

This area has provided key support during Bitcoin‚Äôs lows in July, August, and September.

I view the 50.5K‚Äì53.0K range as a critical support zone.





 (Combined View of Symmetrical Triangle + Large Descending Channel + Major Support Zone) 

Here‚Äôs what the chart looks like when we combine these elements.






 (CPI Schedule)

‚ö™Ô∏è CPI (Consumer Price Index) 

The CPI data will be released on September 11 at 8:30 AM.

It‚Äôs essential to observe whether this data impacts the crypto market. 

Historically, CPI releases have had a significant influence on crypto prices, so be cautious as we may see increased volatility during this period.

-


 

1. The uptrend is still intact.

2. The outcome of the mid-sized symmetrical triangle and large descending channel will be pivotal.

3. Be prepared for potential volatility during tomorrow‚Äôs CPI release.


This is a simple summary of my thoughts. 

Please use it as a reference, and I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your follow and like.

Thank you!

Hello traders and investors! 

For a month, I followed the previous analysis. Now, I‚Äôve decided to create a new one. Let me remind you of the setup. 
Quotes:
 On the 8-hour time frame, a sideways range has also formed. The lower boundary is at 53,485, and the upper boundary is at 71,997.
On the 2-hour timeframe, the seller's vector 8-9 has reached the target of 56078. The volume and delta are conducive to gathering stop losses below the level. The quick recovery by the buyer after the breakout and the candle closing above 56078 increase the likelihood of the price dropping below the local low of 55606. For the buyer's range vector 9-10 to play out (with a potential target of 62745), it would be prudent to accumulate volume and push the price below the local low of 55606. 

In fact, the price followed the assumptions. What‚Äôs next? 

On the daily and 8-hour timeframes, the buyer absorbed the seller's candle and formed a buyer's zone. At the same time, on the 8-hour timeframe, the seller touched the lower boundary of the range at 53,485, from where the buyer resumed. 


On the 2-hour timeframe, the seller manipulated the level of the beginning of the buyer's last impulse (56,078) at point 7 of the range. The price is currently above this level. 


All these factors favor searching for buy opportunities. 

I f the buyer defends 56,078 , potential targets are 
 
 58,519, 59,005, and 62,745, 65000 on the 2-hour timeframe, 
 61,166, 62,198, and 70,079 on the 8-hour timeframe, 
 and 61,166, 62,745, 70,079, and 72,797 on the daily timeframe.
 

Good luck with your trading and investments!
hello guys.

 Range-Bound Market:  Price is moving within a range, with resistance at $66,813.59 and support around $56,200-$54,650.

 Upside and Downside Hunting:  Failed breakout attempts suggest a potential liquidity grab; price may dip below the current range (downside hunting) before reversing.

 Key Levels:
Resistance: $66,813.59
Support: $56,200 - $54,650 

Outlook:  Short-term bearish with a potential reversal from lower support zones.  Watch for a breakout above the range.

Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Observing the chart, we can see that the price some time ago entered to the range, where it at once reached the top part, which coincided with the resistance level and then dropped. BTC fell to the bottom part of the range, which coincided with the current resistance level, and at once rebounded and started to move up. In a short time, the price reached the 61800 level, and broke it, thereby exiting from the range also. Next, the price made a small movement up, after which turned around and started to decline inside the downward channel, where BTC broke the 61800 level one more time. Later, the price declined to the support line of the channel, and at once rose to the resistance line and continued to move down. Price fell to the 56600 level and broke it, after which made a retest and continued to decline. For this case, I think that Bitcoin can make a small movement up and then continue to decline inside the downward channel. Therefore I set my TP at 51000 points.

If we see a 1d candle close under 53k we should expect more bearish momentum

If we continue to move to the upside this will be our first Higher Low on HTF
According to TA Bitcoin is in Reversal Zone. If Price breaks above $57000 with high Volume, Then I'll Consider BTC is Bullish & ready for New High.

Note :
Do your own Research and Trade Wisely Never rely on my opinions.

Good Luck folks
All indicators point to a continued decrease in the price of BTC. Funds are withdrawn from spot ETFs every day, and the mood on the market continues to be short. Looking at the graphs of altcoins, in most cases they are also aimed at continuing the fall. I think that we are in for a strong acceleration, after which a reversal and the beginning of growth is possible.

I consider the range for entering a long position in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã45000-47000
What more can I say than sorry for your dreams and hopes for Bitcoin Halving that you thought was going to change your life and make you  a millionaire and all the coins you bought and waited for Bitcoin to rise so they'll rise too, find the courage and heal and get back to work, you cant cheat your way out of structure, 1D has broken the previous high there will be a pull back before any higher prices, do yourself a favour and look for shorts only. Always remember I want you to win too.
"After the Tokyo swing high is updated, I expect a price correction to the Tokyo swing low following the distribution phase."
I've reviewed hundreds of coins in the past few days, and I can confidently say ‚Äî they're in a tough spot right now 

The charts have dropped so much that many no longer believe in the success of these coins. As an analyst, I see global descending wedges starting to form ‚Äî a phenomenon I observed before the previous bull market.

As for BTC, I‚Äôm seeing prolonged consolidation with the removal of all levels. Experience tells me that autumn is the "golden time" for crypto, so the BTC fractal might play out, as I‚Äôve shown in detail on the chart.
The BTC/USDT daily chart displays a descending channel pattern with a recent test of the lower trendline, indicating a key support area.
The price has recently bounced from the lower boundary near $52,408, showing a potential reversal toward the upper trendline.
The critical support level is highlighted at $52,408. A successful defense of this level could serve as a strong foundation for a bullish move.
The nearest resistance is the descending upper trendline of the channel, currently around $66,000. A breakout above this level could signal the start of a new bullish phase.
Potential Bullish Scenario:

The chart suggests a possible rally from the current levels, with the price potentially moving towards $66,000.
If the price breaks above the channel resistance, it could trigger a larger bullish momentum targeting previous highs or beyond.
Bearish Consideration:

A failure to sustain above $52,408 could lead to a downside continuation towards the next significant support levels around $50,000 or lower.
Monitoring for false breakouts or rejections near the resistance trendline will be essential to manage risk.
Pattern Analysis:

The ongoing consolidation resembles a broadening formation, with increasing volatility at the boundaries of the pattern.
The large upward arrow on the chart indicates a projected move higher, suggesting optimism among traders for a breakout.
Key Takeaways:

A sustained move above the $54,000-$55,000 range with strong volume could validate the bullish scenario.
Positioning should account for both scenarios with stops below $52,000 to mitigate downside risk if the support level fails.
This analysis points towards a cautious optimism for BTC, with critical resistance levels needing to be cleared to confirm a bullish continuation. Keep an eye on the volume and price action around the resistance trendline for further confirmation.

No analysis but wanted to share this color scheme I have concocted. It's nice to look at a beautiful chart if you're going to be staring at it for hours on end. 

I like to avoid very bright or jarring colors on my charts. I also avoid red as much as possible because it's not ideal for keeping a calm collected mind required for trading (IMO). 

I went for a cool modern look with complimentary oranges and steel blues.

Hi traders,

Last week Bitcoin went a little more up and then dropped just like I've said in my outlook.

Now we could see some upside again. So for next week we could see this pair go to the Daily BPR.

Let's see what the market does and react.

Trade idea: Wait for a change in orderflow to bullish, a small correction down on a lower timeframe and trade longs.

If you want to learn more about my analysis, please make sure to follow me, give a like and respectful comment.

This shared post is only my point of view on what could be the next move in this pair based on my analysis. I do not provide signals.

Hey everyone!

Appreciate a like and follow if this analysis helps!

Welcome to this BTC update. BTC is trading inside a broadening wedge pattern in the daily time frame and currently hovering near the lower trendline of the wedge. 

Every time the price tested the lower trendline, it formed a new lower low but, the first time, it made a Lower high, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. This could signal the end of the downtrend and the beginning of a new uptrend.

A potential bullish outcome includes a new all-time high by the end of the year.

Invalidation: Daily close below the previous lower low. 

What are your thoughts on BTC's current price action? Share your analysis in the comments!
Btc/Usdt can give us relief rally pump from current support level, this is the last support of btc to must HOLD. I am expecting relief rally here towrads 58k or 60k then will check charts again and decide direction of the market.
I want to answer this question right away, for me it's only a matter of time. Of course it will be and even higher

In my opinion, we are seeing consolidation after a strong uptrend, which is normal for financial instruments. And this is even more normal than the volatility we have seen in previous years


At the moment, to continue growth, it is important for us to keep the price above 50,000. If this does not happen then we will go to the next level of support and this is 40,000 and this may mean that we will change the consolidation and go into the downtrend. And I don't think it's the job of big money to let the price go so low 

As we can see from the current test of the support level, the volumes are already much smaller, that is, there are fewer people willing to sell.


Locally our task with the current one is to return and make another attempt at the 60,000 test 


On one of the senior timeframes we can observe a convergence that has not yet formed but has been playing for a very long time 

For now I assume that the support level will hold and we will be able to make another approach to exit the consolidation breakout point is 65.000 and this breakout can send the price to new highs


I wish you all good trading, stay safe and try to use spot))
Hi Everyone 
could be some seller come into market , looks bearish for while
hello guys.

as I published before.



 Descending Channel:  The price is trading within a downward channel, indicating a short-term bearish trend.

 Upside Rejection:  Attempts to break above the upper boundary near $59,000 failed, suggesting resistance.

 Downside Target:  If the price continues to follow the channel, it may target the lower boundary near $54,000.

 Key Levels: 
 
 Resistance: $59,000
 Support: $54,000
 Outlook: Bearish momentum with potential downside extension towards the lower support zone. Watch for any break below $54,000 or above the channel for trend reversal signals.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen, more than 30,000 Bitcoins have been transferred to Binance earlier today...

In a previous article, we mentioned the best case scenario and the idea of ignoring the worst case scenario, this can be a mistake. The truth is that Bitcoin, the Cryptocurrency market, tends to surprise, always, either on the bullish or bearish side. Regardless of what happens, it is always wise to consider all scenarios.

The altcoins are correcting below our baseline, which we defined as the price level at which these projects traded around January 2024. The truth is that most altcoins are going back to October 2023 price levels. This is the same price at which the market traded before the major 2023/24 bullish wave; after the long consolidation phase.

Some altcoins did even worse and went lower to break below their June 2023 low and others broke down even further, including big and highly recognized projects, and crashed below their May/June 2022 low reaching new All-Time Lows. Bitcoin is currently trading at the same price it traded back in April/March 2024; very high by all standards.

The higher it trades, and the longer it takes to drop, the stronger the strength of the bearish move. This is called bearish consolidation, which in turn is a distribution phase. The distribution phase is termed so because the big players and large Bitcoin holders distribute their coins to the rest of the market.

Just as a long six months bullish consolidation (accumulation) phase led to a massive bullish rise. In reverse, a long six months bearish consolidation (distribution) phase can lead to a massive bearish crash.

Bitcoin grew just like certain altcoins, it did better than most. Only a few projects grew more than Bitcoin in terms of previous past action. Meaning, only a few projects moved to hit new All-Time Highs. It was Bitcoin and these few. The rest produced a strong wave in late 2023, others minimum growth.

While we know and assume that Bitcoin isn't likely to crash as the altcoins, because of its size and fame, look what happened to Ethereum... And Ethereum is gearing up for another round of the same. The same dynamic where Junk-base is buying billions of Ether to sell to Spot ETF holders at a low price continue. They are accumulating to sell en-mass.

Hope for the best; prepare for the worst.

The best scenario puts Bitcoin at $40,000 as the correction bottom. This can easily still be true.

A stronger correction would send Bitcoin lower toward the $33,000 - $36,000 price range.

A doom scenario and things getting really bad, for whatever reason because things tend to develop always as a surprise, would be Bitcoin between $33,000 and $26,000 on a wick. $26,000 is the price at which Bitcoin traded in October 2023, which is before the final impulse that led to our newest and latest All-Time High of $73,777.

Regardless of the general perception, such a move wouldn't change much in how Bitcoin continues to grow and evolve in the long-term. This can happen if some unforeseen event hits the market. Also because we have about 3 weeks of continued bearish action, which is plenty of time for everything to show up. The least expected scenario is always the one that comes to pass.

There is always good news... The stronger the correction, the stronger the recovery that will follow.

The stronger the panic, the stronger is the lesson that the market participants will learn.

The bigger the shock, the stronger the market reaction and after the recovery happens, more confidence in the system develops and everybody will know for certain, forever that Bitcoin is here to stay.

I am not saying that we will necessarily see $26K but, prepare for the worst... Just in case.

Namaste.
Trade Idea: Bottom for Bitcoin Might Be In

This chart suggests that Bitcoin may have found its bottom, with the potential for a bullish reversal. The following elements highlight this outlook:

 1. Liquidity Zones: 
   - Liquidity/TP1: The chart highlights a take-profit zone (TP1) near the $64,000 level, where liquidity is expected to reside. This is the target area for the long trade.
   - Prev. Monthly High: This is noted above the $70,000 level, potentially acting as a higher resistance level and extended target if momentum continues after TP1.

 2. Entry Zone: 
   - The gray shaded area near the $55,000 level represents the entry zone, with liquidity around this price. This suggests that the price may have tapped into an important liquidity pool before starting its upward movement.
   - External Liquidity: This region below the current price might have acted as a liquidity sweep, further confirming the bottoming pattern.

 3. Fair Value Gap (FVG): 
   - The chart identifies a FVG (Fair Value Gap) around the $56,000 level, which could act as an area of interest. Price has filled this gap, possibly signaling the completion of its downward move.

 4. Market Structure: 
   - The market appears to have tested lower liquidity levels and rejected them, potentially signaling that a local bottom has been established. The price action shows consolidation in the entry area, indicating accumulation before a potential upward move.

This trade idea would be well-suited for traders anticipating a medium-term bounce after Bitcoin‚Äôs recent downward movement.
BINANCE:BTCUSD  is not falling below 50K, which is expected by many. The flagship continues to consolidate ( which has been going on for half a year now ) and accumulate potential at the expense of some traders or another, mostly at the expense of sellers. Why am I being positive? 

  .

In the second half of August, BTC tried to move into the realization phase and headed towards 70K, but ran into a block of limit orders ( resistance ) at 65K - MM is not ready to let the price go. Having formed a double top, the price returns to the range confirming the fact of false breakdown and liquidation, as a consequence of such actions MM has an interest - liquidity from below ( for this reason I am waiting for initial decline with subsequent growth ). The chart above shows the key zones and possible scenarios to pay attention to when forming your strategy

There is no constructive reason for the formed fall and therefore this movement can be considered purely manipulative, the purpose of which may be to buy up the asset through panic selling as well as prolonged accumulation before realization. 

 Resistance levels: 59600, 60500
Support levels: 58700, 57900, 57736, 56078 

  .

The market is still strong but in a range. Any attempts to sell-off are aggressively bought out by whales ( liquidity withdrawal ). On W1-M1 a stop is forming after a strong rally, which is considered as a controlled consolidation within the bull cycle, which is far from ending. The high probability scenario of that technical nuance is an upward distribution of accumulation. 

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:BTCUSD   ;) 

 Regards R. Linda!
2 years have passed since the detailed analysis of the bottom of Bitcoin. This is my last analysis of Bitcoin until the price ceiling is reached. In these two years, I tried to make a profit by including my analysis point of view. I personally do not expect Bitcoin to fall and expect I have a one-year bullish move from Bitcoin. The hold is much harder than I thought. In these two years, my hold has affected my psyche. Try not to follow the analysis of others who talk about the fall, because there is no information about They do not have the nature of Bitcoin. I hope that Bitcoin will move according to my analysis like the last two years. This year I will celebrate the 150,000 dollar Bitcoin celebration. Remember that God is with those who are patient. I wish you health, peace and profit. Good luck.
#Bitcoin : 10/10 So far! Bounce seems highly likely at this level. 
RSI Bullish divergence in the hourly chart.
But of course, no one knows for certain in this kind of market!
Invalidation:- Daily close below $54018.18!

If you're looking for a swing Trade, $54890 to 56150 is a good range to accumulate long on spot!

Futures Setup Here:- There's a higher chance of this setup getting invalidated if we lose 55500 again so be careful to try to keep your entry as low as possible to keep your Stop Loss small.
Always use leverage below 5x!

Entry:-

$56150,  (50% entry)
$55700, (20% Entry)
$54890  (30% Entry)

Targets:- 

$57155
$57855

gm,

as we continue to consolidate and fear begins to rise, it becomes blatantly clear to me as to what is truly going on.

we're clearly in a fourth wave.
fourth waves are notorious for creating fear, uncertainty, and doubt. they make you question weather the trend is truly over, they bore you with sideways price action which makes you hand over your hard earned coin to the one who is re-accumulating, in preparation for the next mark-up phase.

the person who is accumulating will buy everything you have to sell, 1:1. not a penny more.
whenever you run out of coin to sell, the accumulator will begin the mark-up phase, and you will likely begin to fomo back into the market after awhile, which will cause an aggressive \ parabolic push up.

this is a time for accumulation,
not for capitulation.

Analyzing the Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) 4-hour chart gives a clear view of the market's recent activities and provides insight into potential future movements:

Overview of Current Market Conditions:

Bitcoin is currently trading around $56,590, following a significant downtrend from its recent highs. This movement has positioned Bitcoin just above a major support level at $54,319.86 (S1), which is critical to watch in the short term.
Support and Resistance Levels:

Immediate resistance is identified at $58,672.95 (R1). This level could act as a short-term barrier for any upward movements. Further resistance is seen at $65,731.15 (R2) and $70,387.98 (R3), which align with previous price consolidation zones and peaks.
Key support levels are $54,319.86 (S1) and a more substantial base at $48,745.21 (S2). These levels could potentially hold further price declines if the current support fails.
Technical Indicators:

The MACD is currently below the signal line and hovering near zero, indicating a weak momentum and a bearish market stance. This suggests that there might be continued downward pressure or consolidation in the near term.
The RSI is at 43.44, which is neither in the oversold nor overbought territory. However, it leans towards a bearish sentiment, aligning with the MACD's indications.
Trading Strategy:

Given Bitcoin's proximity to the $54,319.86 support level (S1), my immediate strategy would be to monitor this level closely. A bounce off this support with increased volume could signal a potential buying opportunity, targeting the first resistance at $58,672.95 (R1). Conversely, a break below this support could see Bitcoin testing the next major support at $48,745.21 (S2), presenting a short position opportunity.
Entering a trade, I would place a stop-loss just below $54,000 for long positions, to mitigate risk in case of a sudden downturn. For short positions, a stop just above $54,500 after confirming a breakdown would be prudent.
Risk Management:

Considering the volatile nature of Bitcoin, maintaining a strict risk management strategy is crucial. Adjusting stop-loss levels to break-even when prices move favorably can protect gains and reduce potential losses.
Regularly reviewing upcoming economic events and news that may affect market sentiment is also vital, as crypto markets can be highly responsive to such stimuli.
Overall, this analysis aims to leverage technical insights to capitalize on Bitcoin's price movements, balancing between cautious observation and readiness to act on clear market signals.
There is a possibility of the asset continuing to decline until it reaches the discount zone of the order block. After that, I anticipate a strong markup.
Bitcoin is in a downward channel - trade after big SL hunt

during this inviermanet better to trade after clear liquidation events 

at this meant i have 2 key zones for trade

1st  - at $55 300 
2nd - at $54 260  


Short possible if price consolidate our from value for 2 -3 days
BITCOIN Growth up to 65K 

Currently BTC consolidating and prepare for its next significant move the key resistance level at $59600 is important for Bitcoin to overcome again Futher upside momentum.

Technical analysis:
59600 price level has been indified at significant resistance point.
Breaking thorough this zone could Signal strong bullish trend which can push Bitcoin up to 62500 which crossponds to another strong Zone. 

Continue for interest for institiual investor's can provide the necessary capital inflow to push BTC past these resistance levels.

Positive regulatory developments can boast market confidence  aiding in the upward movement of Bitcoin.

Global economic condition including inflation rats and monitary policies will also play a significant role in the Bitcoin price trajectory.

Based on the new economics data we received the past week I expect a further dump for BTC at least till the FED rates day (19th). However, based on the all-in short mentality by traders, I expect some nice spikes during that time.
BTC is likely headed for a correction, with potential targets at $38K or even $30K. Keep an eye on key support levels and market sentiment for confirmation of this short trade setup. Be prepared for volatility as the market adjusts! üìâ #BTC #Bitcoin #CryptoCorrection"
Welcome back future demons

Let's jump right into the TA. 

We have a potential short trade here. This might not qualify as the perfect example of a Head and Shoulder formation in Classical Charting, but the over all structure and pattern is bearish.

Also yesterday we saw a significant drop combined with huge volume increase.

Kind Regards

Hello Everyone 
Hopefully going to be profitable week ahead of us
Expecting some sellers on BTC 1 hour chart But there is support reaction will be there first

Just now open bitcoin short.


Potential early close/partial $55000

70% profit target $54000
Potential full close at $51000

Eventually I anticipate market to reach back to the $47000-45000 area to create a potential bottom.

And for this week I think we'll probably hit 50k. So this short right here could be the potential start of the move.

For me its a matter of when at this point not if bitcoin will make new lows. Its all about probabilities and based on my analysis that's where price is likely to go.
The whales trading bots and algorithms have been updated again and this time the feature has been set to "sideways." This is the best possible scenario for the Cryptocurrency market as a whole.

‚ûñ If Bitcoin crashes too strongly, too fast, the Altcoins cannot recover.
‚ûñ If the Altcoins cannot recover, the market can die because it has been red for too long.

‚ûñ If Bitcoin moves up and rises too fast, the neglected Altcoins section of the market cannot grow because Bitcoin would suck all of the energy.

‚û¢ When Bitcoin is sideways at a high price, the entire Altcoins market can shine.

The Altcoins we've been looking at produced a major low followed by the initial bullish breakout. After this initial bullish breakout, ALL, produced a higher low and are now resuming their bullish action.

Imagine, if Bitcoin crashed today, instead of a higher low and the resumption of the bullish move everything would crash together with it. Instead, if Bitcoin stalls and goes sideways, say for 10-14 days, the Altcoins can produce a huge bullish wave. We are talking between 100% and 300% growth in such a short-period of time.

This is enough for energy to reach all sectors of the market... After this phase whatever needs to happen will happen and then the market will continue with its major flush before the next full blown bull-market.

There is a second benefit for the market owners. When everybody's attention goes to the Altcoins, they will forget about the capitulation event, and this will make it 1,000 times easier for the surprise, unexpected, highly predictable, 6 months in the making crash to take place.

Nothing changes... We buy and hold focusing on the long-term.

It doesn't matter how far down it goes;
It doesn't matter how long the recovery after the crash will take;
We are in the accumulation phase and we focus on the Altcoins for massive gains.

Knowing that there will be a recovery after the fall, we can just look at those that already hit bottom and buy them up.

When Bitcoin completes is bearish cycle, we can catch the bottom and with Bitcoin too go LONG!

Thank you for reading.

I am always grateful for your amazing and continued support.

Hi Guys
I Can see some Buyer into Market , I like to see What they can Do
so looks some Bullish At the moment . Possibly some  profit taking from seller side . 
But market could  bonce down a bit before go up . 

Best of Luck
I would love for Btc to take out Weekly liquidity and get everybody bullish before the real bloodbath begins
BlackRock is nowhere to be found... And I noticed that lately Michael Saylor hasn't been buying any Bitcoins. What to make of this information?

One way to look at the Bitcoin market from a rookie bullish perspective, is through the story that Bitcoin is strong and cannot move lower because (1) the Spot ETFs (aka. BlackRock) will buy everything and (2) Michael Saylor "bought Bitcoin."

This is a true story.

Bitcoin is still trading at $57,700.

Now, what if you are one of those Spot ETFs and MS Bought Bitcoin kind of person, how are you feeling now that these people are nowhere to be found? Does this lowers your confidence in Bitcoins ability to maintain its current price, or, are we still aiming for 100K next?

The correction is on! and has been ongoing for almost six months now.  We are about to experience what traders call the final "leg down." 

It is very intriguing, I can feel the suspense in the air... But we have bearish action, lower lows and normally, when you are about to experience a very strong rise everything is green, day after day. Right now I am only seeing red.

What do you make of the current situation?
Is Bitcoin going up or down?

Prepare for the crash.

We are trading the altcoins but remember, and this is very important, at first, everything can experience a very strong negative reaction but everything soon stabilises. The smaller ones will recover sooner, some will not even flinch. Others will grow... We looked at this many times through hundreds of charts. 

The big ones, the giants, are going to crash together with Bitcoin. You already know about those.
The altcoins trading against Bitcoin, some are safe but prepare to hold strong for a few days.

The tether pairs are mixed. Each chart should be considered individually.

I am wishing you the best.

Once the correction is over, we will be sharing bullish charts, LONG, until late 2025.
It will be awesome.

I love you.
You are truly appreciated.

Thanks a lot for your amazing support.
I love life.

Namaste.
üîç Technical analysis:  Ascending diamond pattern 

- According to the  latest analysis presented , Bitcoin made a correction based on the predicted path to the second green box area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe $50,000 correction range.

- In the recent modification, a double zigzag has been formed. The second zigzag is a flat correction.

 According to the formation of an ascending diamond pattern in the green box area, after the failure of the dynamic trigger, the diamond pattern will be confirmed and it can expect to climb up to the specified areas according to the previous analysis.

üíé  Note: Also, if a failure occurs from the bottom of the template, this template is invalid and must be checked and updated again.

Hi Guys 
Hope you ding well.!
I can see some buyers coming into market that probably move market up next Couple of hours
Best of luck !

Remember quick in and out .



Please note that this is not investment advice this is just my thought to share
POSSIBLE MOVE UNTIL FEB NEXT YEAR

 In January 2024, BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, launched two spot Bitcoin ETFs ‚Äì the BlackRock Bitcoin Trust and the BlackRock Bitcoin Private Trust. These funds offer institutional and individual investors regulated access to Bitcoin, marking a significant milestone for BlackRock in the crypto space. With over $8 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock‚Äôs entry was seen as a major endorsement of Bitcoin and a sign of growing institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have garnered over $60 billion in assets under management (AUM) so far.
I think the Market is Bullish but
I think we will have a short nice setup in NY session!
Lets see
Happy Trade!
Money flowing out of Bitcoin will flow to the Altcoins?

How are you feeling today my dear reader?
I am hoping you are having a wonderful week.

Just as a friendly reminder, Bitcoin's correction is not yet over and $40,000 is likely NOT the bottom of this corrective phase.

How low it truly goes it is an open ended question but it is something that will surprise most participants, as usual.

Why would Bitcoin move lower?
Why not 100K?

The market moves in cycles and it tends to seek balance.

A prolonged bullish wave, 16 months, is matched by a strong correction.
It is just the way it works.

This is normal market action and this should not discourage anybody... We are full green for 2025 and the only troublesome period is between now and October.

The "trouble" period for Bitcoin is August 2024 and September 2024.
October 2024, November 2024 and December 2024 is neutral and recovery.

January 2025 and February 2025, is back to high prices and green.  Then we will see massive growth in 2025 until we hit a new All-Time High of around $190,000.  More or less.

Hold strong throughout the correction.

Consider the altcoins. Many hit bottom. It is wise to buy those trading low and sell those trading high. Trading 101. Simplicity is key.

Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions.

Namaste.
The price of Bitcoin is likely to return to around 58K and 60K and then fall again to 48K.
According to the picture, we also have 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci.
These are the plots of pivot boss I created for almost 8 months, based on Renko chart and volumetric patterns, generally BTC will move along yellow-dash and blue-dash with red line as amplifier effect. Looking at this direction we have new hope by mid Sept on the 16th to hit 61K again, however the next drop will determined a new course of the ship. Hopefully I'm still as highly accurate on predicting BTC movement.
short entry: $60,700 -- stop: $64,000 -- target: $43,000

mean-reversion followed by forced liquidations
When the BTCUSDT daily chart is examined; It is observed that the price movements continue in a downward trend. It is evaluated that the crypto can target the 64835 level by passing the 59867 level in price movements above the 53657 level, but it is evaluated that it can retreat to the 43817 level by breaking the 49071 level in price movements below the 53657 level.

üì£ Kazuo Ueda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, announced that if the economy and inflation progress as expected, the bank will continue raising interest rates. In a statement to a government panel led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, he noted that the economic environment remains favorable, and adjusted interest rates for inflation remain negative, even after the main rate hike in late July. This increase, the first in decades, led to the unwinding of yen carry trades and volatility in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

üìä Market Impact:
Ueda's comments increased demand for the yen, bringing the USD/JPY exchange rate down from 147 to 145.85. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures dropped by 0.5%, and Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell by 0.4%. The Bank of Japan's tightening policy contrasts with expectations of rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, which could further strengthen the yen against other currencies.

üåç Global Ripple Effects:
This scenario may force traders to sell risky investments and repay yen-denominated loans, impacting global markets.

üí° Yen Carry Trade Unwind:
The unwinding of yen carry trades, a strategy of borrowing yen and investing in higher-yielding assets, has already disrupted markets, contributing to Bitcoin's decline from $70,000 to $50,000 in the past month. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, warned that the continued unwinding of these trades could destabilize markets unless central banks increase money supply by expanding their balance sheets. Japan's long-standing low-interest policy had fueled widespread yen carry trades, with the Japanese government involved in around $20 trillion of such trades as of last October, according to Deutsche Bank.

Looking at the daily chart of BTC, I expect a fake upside moves in the London session that will lead to a dump in the NY. Area of interest are marked on the chart
Bitcoin  is moving near the  Support zone($58,000-$56,600) .

Regarding  Classic Technical Analysis , Bitcoin seems to have succeeded in breaking the upper line of the  Falling Wedge Pattern . It is also possible to form the  Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern .

Regarding  Elliott wave theory , Bitcoin seems to have completed the  Double Three Correction(WXY) . This wave is part of  Corrective Waves .

Also, we can see  Regular Divergence(RD+)  between  Consecutive Valleys .

I expect Bitcoin to go  UP  to at least the  target of the   Falling Wedge Pattern .

My previous post titled " Bitcoin Analysis==>> Pumping Again==>>Short term
 " is  still valid 

 Note: If Bitcoin loses the Support zone($58,000-$56,600), we should expect Bitcoin to fall to $55,000(at least).

DISCLAIMER: This is not trade advice. This is for educational and entertainment purposes only to demonstrate how I intend to participate in this market. Trading involves real risk. Do your own due diligence.

People like myself (with average-to-below average intelligence) need a simple strategy. 
My "Ducks in a Barrel" strategy is exactly that. Simple. Clear. Rules Based. Effective. Zero Discretion.

BTC (and several other cryptos, for that matter), are setup for "Ducks in a Barrel" long trades. Lets review the process for identifying these setups. To be clear, this is not a "long now" post. This market is SETUP. This is not a timing tool. We get into the market once we get a technical long TRIGGER on the Daily timeframe. From there, we FOLLOW THROUGH on the trade by managing risk and maximizing profit. Without the TRIGGER, we have not trade.

 STEP 1:  Identify a market with a strong trend on the weekly timeframe. I utilize the 39 and 52 period MA. For uptrends, we want to see both MA's sloping up and pulling away from each other. We see on BTC that the two MA's are still upward sloping and pulling away from each other. This confirms step 1, that we are in a strong uptrend.
 
STEP 2:  We need at least 2 of the following to be in unison with the direction we want to trade (in the case of BTC, we need 2 of these to support the long idea).
VALUATION: For longs, we need an undervaluation vs Gold &/or Treasuries.
STOCHASTIC: For longs, we need to see the market is oversold.
SENTIMENT: For longs, we want to see Bearish advisor sentiment (we fade the public sentiment).

 STEP 3:  We see that BTC is Oversold on the Stochastic and is Undervalued vs Gold & Treasuries. This meets our criteria of 2/3 indicators supporting our idea. This market is now SET UP for longs. Now we wait for the TRIGGER.

 STEP 4:  We are waiting for Step 4 in Bitcoin right now. We need to see an entry TRIGGER on the daily timeframe via one of the following entry techniques.
18 Period MA Entry
10 high 8 close MAC w/ Williams Acc/Dis 57 MA Confirmation Entry
Stop either 150% of 3 Period ATR, or 2 times the width of the MAC, whichever is greater.
There are other entry techniques, but they are higher risk. The two entry techniques above will not catch the absolute bottom, but will ensure that you are buying into a confirmed trend change. Other entry techniques come with the risk of trying to "bottom/top" pick, which increases your odds of several losses prior to the real move occuring.

If you have questions about the "Ducks in a Barrel" strategy, feel free to shoot me a message.

I hope you all have a great week.

And as always.....

Good Luck & Good Trading.
Elliot Wave Theory is an absolute favorite of mine, combined with Wyckoff Method and chart analysis (trendlines and technical indicators). If you've been following; you'll know I've been speaking of a multi-month cycle, specifically a multi month corrective wave before the final impulse wave up (4-5).

Considering we're still in that corrective phase, let's take a look at TWO options from here:

 Option 1 , is we retrace around -50%, same as last time. However, this would pose an issue - if we drop lower than (1), it invalidates the Elliot Wave Theory, and also invalidates the bullish cycle. The second problem, is that the previous cycle's increase (2-3) was MUCH bigger than the current 2-3 we are observing. This brings us to option 2.


 Option 2 , is that we retrace around the same ratio as the previous cycle. To calculate the ration, we need to see what % we retraced and compare it to the % increase. 
We increased 1533.92% (2-3)and retraced 55.25% (3-4). That means it's a 3.6% correction compared to the increase.
For the current cycle, we increased 357.27% (2-3) and retraced 33.76% (3-4). This gives us a 9,45% correction - three times as much as the previous cycle.


You can take this two ways -  either we're following a 50% correction, OR we're not falling lower than the current point 4 which is around $49K. 

 Share your thoughts!

This area had held as support previously but it needs to hold this time around too, failing that $50,000 is the bottom of the daily downtrend channel. 

US CPI (Wednesday) & PPI (Thursday) this week, as with big news events we can potentially see volatility, this will be the last US CPI before rate cuts begin in the US, in Europe rate cuts are forecast to begin on Thursday, predicted to drop from 4.25% to 3.65% according to invesing.com, a 60bps cut.

Another major news event this week is the Trump v Harris Presidential debate. I'm not expecting a whole lot of crypto talk in this debate, if I'm being completely honest I can't see it being an adult debate about political policy at all. However, I do think it will have an effect on the markets one way or another, obviously Trump is the better outcome for crypto if he stays true to his plans set out during the Bitcoin conference compared to the plans for the Harris administration to tax un-realized gains which is not very pro-investment. Again, I'm not holding my breath for any information on crypto but it is a major news event all the same.

So in conclusion this week is full of news events that could create volatility, with BTC at its current level nearer the bottom of the daily trend. It does feel like we're maybe coming to an end of the chop with monetary policy pivot taking place soon.
Bitcoin can reach up to 56,000 and maybe with a little optimism up to 57,800 in the second stage, for a stronger climb, you have to be a little patient so that the conditions are met.
Bitcoin bounced down off the descending trendline and the resistance level. The decline to support level at $53.5k is expected to happen
If BTC has truly found it's bottom, this structure could be the start of a 5 wave elliot wave structure.

Using fib extensions as well as time fibs to mark out a potential 5 wave bullish structure from where BTC is currently.

Interesting thing shows confluence with the end to a bullish trend towards the end of November before we have a correction.
I'm spotting a Inverted head and shoulders pattern on 15m. Hopefully we should get a measured move to $54,900 and then possibly short from $55,500. We will see.
I just entered a bitcoin scalp long.

Target is $57500.

I do think we are going lower but the bulls might have enough demand left for another attempt to push price higher....which I think will be temporary
üìä There Is Nothing New Happened For The BTC, The Price Is Playing At 53900$ To 57300$ Range

üëâ57300$ Is a Range High And Any Breakout From This Level Will Lead The Price To The 66k Area

üëâ53900$ Is a Range Low And Any Breakdown From This Level Will Lead The Price To The 44k

üì• Still I‚Äôm Out of The Market And Will Enter After Breakout From 57300$ Or At The 44k
Bitcoin  has entered September 2024 under pressure, following a broader pattern seen in previous years where the month tends to be bearish for the cryptocurrency. Historically, Bitcoin has faced average declines of about 4-7% in September, often driven by a combination of market sentiment and broader macroeconomic factors, such as changes in U.S. monetary policy.

As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $54,700, reflecting a slight rebound after testing lower levels near $52,950, which aligns with the lower Bollinger Band. The market remains largely cautious, with key indicators reflecting mixed signals:

Bollinger Bands and Volatility: Bitcoin is trading between the lower and middle bands, which shows that while it‚Äôs under bearish pressure, it hasn‚Äôt yet fully broken down. Historically, a move below the lower band often signals oversold conditions, leading to a bounce, and we see the price now holding above $53,000. However, volatility remains high, as shown by the ATR (Average True Range) at 958.80, indicating that the swings in price are likely to remain large, adding to the uncertainty.

 Momentum Indicators: 
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) stands at 39.29, signaling mildly oversold conditions. This level suggests that Bitcoin may not face heavy selling pressure from here unless broader market conditions worsen, but it‚Äôs not low enough to confidently call for a strong rebound either.
The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) remains in bearish territory, with the MACD line at -1,017 and the signal line at -944, indicating that downward momentum is still present but might be slowing. The negative histogram at -72.85 further confirms ongoing selling pressure but suggests it‚Äôs not accelerating.
Parabolic SAR and Stochastic Oscillator: The Parabolic SAR is hovering at $54,988, just above the current price, reinforcing that Bitcoin is still in a short-term downtrend. However, the Stochastic Oscillator at %K: 46.27 and %D: 37.77 is showing early signs of a possible bullish crossover, hinting at a potential recovery if buying interest picks up from these levels.

 Short-Term Outlook 
Given the overall technical setup, Bitcoin appears to be in a consolidation phase after a sharp sell-off earlier in the month. The $52,950 level is acting as strong support, and as long as Bitcoin holds above this, the immediate threat of a more significant breakdown seems to be avoided. However, it needs to reclaim the $55,853 middle Bollinger Band to challenge higher resistance levels, especially the upper band at $58,758, which would signal a shift in momentum.

 Market Sentiment and Broader Trends 
In terms of broader sentiment, the market remains cautious due to ongoing speculation about a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could introduce more volatility. Analysts at Bitfinex have pointed out that a rate cut could trigger a deeper correction to $55,000 or lower, potentially pushing Bitcoin as low as $45,000 in a worst-case scenario.

That said, some analysts, including Rekt Capital, expect Bitcoin to consolidate through the rest of September and potentially break out in late September or October, a historically more favorable month for the cryptocurrency. If Bitcoin can hold support and gain momentum heading into October, there‚Äôs potential for it to reverse its current downtrend and push toward higher levels in the mid-to-high $60,000s, particularly if macroeconomic conditions stabilize.

 Conclusion 
Bitcoin‚Äôs current market behavior reflects its usual September weakness, with mixed technical indicators suggesting a period of consolidation. With a key support zone around $53,000 holding firm, the market appears to be waiting for clearer signals, potentially from economic data or broader risk sentiment. A short-term recovery is possible, especially if Bitcoin can clear the $55,800 level, but traders should remain cautious given the historical volatility and upcoming macroeconomic events.
üì£ Kazuo Ueda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, announced that if the economy and inflation progress as expected, the bank will continue raising interest rates. In a statement to a government panel led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, he noted that the economic environment remains favorable, and adjusted interest rates for inflation remain negative, even after the main rate hike in late July. This increase, the first in decades, led to the unwinding of yen carry trades and volatility in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

üìä Market Impact:
Ueda's comments increased demand for the yen, bringing the USD/JPY exchange rate down from 147 to 145.85. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures dropped by 0.5%, and Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell by 0.4%. The Bank of Japan's tightening policy contrasts with expectations of rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, which could further strengthen the yen against other currencies.

üåç Global Ripple Effects:
This scenario may force traders to sell risky investments and repay yen-denominated loans, impacting global markets.

üí° Yen Carry Trade Unwind:
The unwinding of yen carry trades, a strategy of borrowing yen and investing in higher-yielding assets, has already disrupted markets, contributing to Bitcoin's decline from $70,000 to $50,000 in the past month. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, warned that the continued unwinding of these trades could destabilize markets unless central banks increase money supply by expanding their balance sheets. Japan's long-standing low-interest policy had fueled widespread yen carry trades, with the Japanese government involved in around $20 trillion of such trades as of last October, according to Deutsche Bank.

Market Analysis: 

The current market structure for Bitcoin (BTC) is exhibiting bearish tendencies. The price is approaching a significant high level, and there are potential selling pressures near the Order Block and Point of Interest (POI). Additionally, the Fibonacci Golden Zone is a critical area to watch.

 Trade Recommendation: 

If the price breaks below 55,100, it could indicate a surge in selling pressure. To capitalize on this potential downtrend, consider a short position.

 Trade Details: 

 Entry:  Sell BTCUSDT below 55,080
 Target:  54,400 - 54,000 - 53,800
 Stop Loss:  300-500 points

 Rationale: 

 Bearish Structure:  The overall market structure suggests a bearish trend.
 Order Block and POI:  These areas often act as resistance levels, and a break below them could trigger a sell-off.
 Fibonacci Golden Zone:  This zone represents a significant price level that could offer resistance.
 Liquidity:  The presence of large liquidity levels at 54,400 - 54,188 could provide support for a potential price decline.
 
Note:  This is a general recommendation based on the current market analysis. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any trading decisions.
The long that was taken has played out well. And the short are tucked out. This does not mean that the short was a bad trade. But that we have broken a level. We have now gained and retested the level that Bitcoin has brought down.

Unfortunately, the breakout has already happened
it is very clear to me that this year bear cycle is not going to be like covid crash since the FED has announced IT IS TIME TO ADJUST POLICY from being restrictive to easing. fill your bags with the good ones and for sure BTC is one of them.
The BTC/USDT weekly chart shows Bitcoin currently trading near $54,996, testing a descending trendline and a key horizontal resistance zone between $60,000 and $65,000.
There is a significant support zone between $43,000 and $46,000, which Bitcoin has respected in the past. This zone could serve as a strong base for a potential bounce if tested.

The highlighted resistance zone around $60,000 to $65,000 remains a critical area that Bitcoin needs to break above to confirm a bullish continuation.
The green support zone between $43,000 and $46,000 is the immediate downside target if Bitcoin continues to face selling pressure. Below this level, the ascending trendline offers additional support around the $40,000 level.
Potential Scenarios:

 If Bitcoin can hold above the $55,000 mark and push through the overhead resistance, we could see a rally towards the next psychological level of $70,000 and beyond. The upper arrow on the chart suggests optimism for a potential breakout.
 A failure to hold above current levels might lead to a retest of the lower support zones around $46,000, and potentially lower if market conditions worsen.

A weekly close above $65,000 would provide a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential continuation toward all-time highs.
Monitoring volume and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD on the weekly timeframe could provide early signals of a trend reversal or continuation.

The presence of a descending triangle pattern indicates potential consolidation before a major move. Market sentiment will play a key role in dictating the direction of the next breakout.
Broader market factors, including macroeconomic data and overall crypto market health, will influence BTC's price action.

Traders should watch the key support levels closely and consider stop-loss placements just below the $43,000 zone to manage risk effectively.
It's important to adjust positions based on Bitcoin's price action around these critical zones, especially near major support and resistance levels.
This weekly update provides an overview of the key levels and potential scenarios for BTC/USDT. With Bitcoin currently at a crossroads near important resistance, market participants should closely monitor for breakout or breakdown signals in the coming weeks.

Yello Paradisers! Are you prepared for what's next? #Bitcoin has been in a persistent downtrend, and the pattern of lower lows and lower highs continues to define its movement on the major time frames. However, recent price action hints at a possible shift. 

üíé#BTCUSDT, After the latest lower low, we saw a brief relief bounce. But don‚Äôt get too comfortable just yet‚Äîthis bounce could be short-lived. The pair is currently eyeing a bullish order block in the $55,945 - $54,865 range. From here, the price is likely to head toward the next resistance zones, which could merely serve as another relief bounce.

üíéLooking ahead, the next significant move could see BTCUSDT revisiting the daily demand zone between $52,769 and $50,505. If the volume supports this move, expect the price to face resistance around $60,245. Should volume remain strong, the next crucial resistance zone lies at $64,371. Flipping this level could propel BTC toward $68,246.

üíéAll bets are off if BTCUSDT closes below 45,594. This would invalidate the bullish outlook, signaling a deeper decline.

Stay sharp and remember Paradisers , patience and disciplined trading are key in this volatile market. Stay alert, trade smart, and keep a close eye on these crucial levels. This market could swing either way‚Äîdon‚Äôt get caught off guard!

On the above 10 day chart a bull flag is identified. In addition RSI has recently confirmed the 52 level as support. This is an important indication on this timeframe, look left.

When does 128k strike? Don‚Äôt know. No one does. However it happens before June 2025 or not at all. When it happens, that is the market top. Exit all crypto positions by this time.

Is it possible price action continues downtrend? Sure.
Is it probable? No.

Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken
The most obvious move are the ones that will make u wealthy bitcoin is in a flag that also translates into a cup and handle the weekly stochastic is exhausted this setup is a 1:10 but as we know it‚Äôs going to be a bullish move we could compound trades on the way up eg ¬£2000 1:2 = ¬£6000(total) ¬£6000 1:2= ¬£18,000 total ect I believe there is at least 6 moves in  this big move up
I go over my thinking for nailing the 6% drop and the rise back up to 58k for Bitcoin. In the same idea I had shared and I talk about the need to be patient right now as we potentially have over-speculation causing tight choppy waves. We need to let the chart speak to us and right now it's not saying anything.
Bitcoin's looking bearish short-term. Key supports to watch: 54,800 and the CME gap at 54,000. I expect a bullish reversal around 53,500-54,000. Resistance is strong at 58,000 and 59,000. My take: we'll see a dip before any upward movement.
I see this D-wave in the3 VRVP could go sown to $55,247 That is all.
which level of Fibo can be entry for short?
What do u think?

Happy Trade!
Not much has changed here for Bitcoin, even though we did get a decent move up yesterday back into the range.

What ‚Äúmay‚Äù be important is that Bitcoin has potentially put in it‚Äôs first higher low since the all time high. As you can see, we have had bearish market structure - a series of lower highs and lower lows. This higher low would be conrirmed by a break above $65,000 - the last lower high.
Strong weekly support at $56,000-$54,927 has been respected on several occasions. This suggests accumulation of buyers in that area and the possibility of a bullish rebound. Recent candles indicate a double bottom and little selling pressure, reinforcing the idea of a potential rise towards $58,000 or higher. However, if the support is broken, the price could look for lower levels around $52,000.
In the range of 53,600 to 55,400 dollars, you can think about a position to buy bitcoin. Get confirmation of this position in 1H time frame.

BTCUSD have been moving on a falling wedge we have a breakouts and retest and now i want to see the price closes above 58k today then more of swing  is expected till we arrive 65k.
I want to know your view on this...............

I can see big players buying this level.  I expect a reversal and movement to around 58k.
We are going back to basics. These are the lessons I used to share in 2018.

The black line stands for MA200.
The magenta line stands for EMA55.

MA200 is a slow moving moving average. 
EMA55 is a fast moving moving average, in comparison to MA200.

‚ûñ The bullish cross

When EMA55 moves above MA200 we have a bullish cross. This is a bullish signal.
Here it happened in January 2023 and October 2023, in both cases this signal preceded a major rise in prices.

‚ûñ The bearish cross

When EMA55 moves below MA200 we have a bearish cross. This is a bearish signal.
Here it happened recently, mid-August 2024. This signal points to a major decrease in prices.

These basic signals support all the more complex analyses I've been sharing.

There are many of these. I can find literally hundreds.

‚û¢ If you have experience or have been with me for many years you will find this boring.

‚û¢ If you are new, you might find this useful.

‚û¢ If you've been burdened by too much information, too many opinions and complexity, you might find this enlightening and soothing for your mind.

In any case, please support this trade-idea with your comments and boost.

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.
Any deviation from the variables outlined here cancels the scenario and requires reassessment.

From $57,000, I expect a correction to the 4-hour imbalance, followed by an impulse up to $61,000-$62,000, where short positions can be considered. The target would be the imbalance likely forming around the $56,000-$57,000 range, from where we could fuel up for a move to $65,000. At $65,000, it's highly probable a short position with a target of $49,000 will be the best option.

However, if during the rise to $65,000, an area of interest forms on the weekly timeframe, I will not enter a short at $65,000 and will wait to see how things unfold with the new variables in mind.

Bitcoin price is moving in a descending channel on the 4-hour frame and is largely adhering to its borders.

The price has touched the lower limit of the channel, which is considered a support area in green at $53,000.

The price is now 54,600, which is the entry point.
The price is expected to reach the upper limit of the channel at $56,730.

Hey guys. Keep it simple. Here are the major trendlines. We have a bullish "wideing megaphone" pattern formed, in addition to bouncing off the trendlines a higher low has formed. Look for long entries here
K3 close below the consolidation channel,
It seems that the following candles will accelerate.

On the other hand,
If the following candles close upon K1,
I will change my plan.

Short-55.1K/Stop-57.1K/Target-42K
Yes, the title is correct.

I anticipate a massive sell off this weekend and by the time you read this post I will already be in the trade. In fact am already in a short from previous Idea this will be a big scale in position.

Briefly put, the bears are in control whether you like it or not. I don't care which side is in control like many of you in the chat, I just want to be on the right side. Long term we bullish but right now we correcting and as such bearish on lower timeframes

Weekly, daily, 4hr and 1hr timeframe are all trending down. Which means the odds are significantly in favor of the bears-We don't get easy markets like this all the time. Its that simple guys. Trade probabilities, why would you want to go against the trend, or rationalized it...that's futile. If the market was to flip bullish, you don't have to ask me twice if am a look for a long, if plan says long then go long.

Now, the bull market is safe as long as we don't break below 26k area. Let me just state that quickly because I see many in Tv chat calling bear market and that's because you guys don't understand market structure and trends properly. Believe it or not all this down movement is just one big correction...until it's not, that's why 26k is important to hold but I don't think we'll fall that low. 47-45k is my prediction for bottom, if that fail then 31k.

Anyways, just wanted to give a bit of context. For this trade:

potential early close at $53500...I doubt here will be enough demand there but its a potential reversal area to monitor.

Main tp is $51500, I will for sure take at least 75% off since it's so close to final tp which is $50,000 where I will fully close the position.

That's the plan given all goes well. The odds are in my favor and checks all the boxes in my trade plan.

I Just now entered short and posting this idea right now. I'll update in the comment if I decide to make any adjustments.

Overall RR to 51500 is roughly 10 RR which would be a fxcking blessing for my accounts.

This post is longer than usual but such a bold prediction deserves it.
Bitcoin Update ‚Äì Monday, 09.09.2024

As-salamu alaykum and Good Morning to All Brothers and Sisters,

This past weekend, #Bitcoin made some impressive moves, but we are still below the first resistance level on the 4-hour timeframe. As the U.S. markets open today, there's a possibility that #Bitcoin could break through this initial resistance and move towards the second one. I've updated the support and resistance levels according to the recent dump, and these lines will help us track the market's next move.

What's Next?

If Bitcoin manages to break through these resistance levels, we could see a solid uptrend forming from this point. However, if it fails to do so, we might experience another pullback. At the moment, we're sitting at the bottom of our designated yellow area, which I believe could act as strong support for now. The price may hold in this zone, but it's crucial to watch closely as the day unfolds.

#Alts (Altcoins)

As I mentioned in my last analysis, I'm waiting for the first resistance breakout before giving any new buy signals for altcoins. Right now, the movement is uncertain, and it's best to remain cautious. I recommend waiting for today's candle to close before making any new entries. Insha‚ÄôAllah, once the market gives us a clearer direction, we can proceed accordingly.

I wish everyone a very profitable and successful week ahead. Stay patient and keep your eyes on the charts!
after sideway action i am expecting leg down, there is no catalyst in near future and effect from FED loosening policy we will se later

disclaimer: not financial advice
BTCUSDT continues its downward trend, with a noticeable lack of buying pressure since late August. The price action has been characterized by consistent lower lows and lower closes. Even on the daily chart, we see this pattern persisting, despite a recent false breakout below the July low, with the price hovering near that level again. Historically, September tends to be a difficult month for Bitcoin, often resulting in negative performance. This pattern suggests that the price could drop further, potentially breaking below the 50,000 mark and aiming for the support zone between 48,000 and 45,000. If the price reaches this zone, a strong rebound could occur, potentially sparking a new bullish trend. The target is the support level at 51,220.00
Our gameplan on the weekly timeframe remains the same, and we‚Äôre still hovering around the resistance zone after several tests.

As the price starts to pull away from this zone and sellers gradually take control, we‚Äôre now setting our eyes on the $40K neckline zone. Ideally, this move would bring the RSI into the oversold territory, creating a potential buying opportunity that could push the price towards $50K.

This gameplan will continue to be our guide over the next few months as we monitor how the market behaves.

This trade is based on Power Variation for measuring volatility, Gaussian Kernel Smoothing EMA, and Value at Risk, nothing else. Since volatility is increasing and trending up, meanwhile the Gaussian Kernel Smoothing EMA is trending down, I expect bigger price moves that are bearish and bet that my take profit is hit.

The Cumulative Volume Delta Divergence is an indicator that helps traders visually assess the buying and selling pressures in the market by analyzing volume divergences over time. This indicator overlays directly on the price chart, offering insights into how volume shifts correlate with price movements.

Utility and Trading Benefit
Divergence Detection
The primary utility of this indicator lies in its ability to detect divergences between volume trends and price movements. Such divergences can signal potential price reversals, providing traders with early warnings about shifts in market sentiment.
Enhanced Decision Making
By integrating volume analysis directly with price action on the chart, the indicator aids traders in making more informed decisions regarding entry and exit points. This can be crucial for capitalizing on trends or avoiding potential losses.

hi guys.
In my opinion price should be pumped for short time ,and the resistances as u can see are:
58k
59k
61k
and62k 
but remember the main direction is bearish.
I'LL  post the main direction.
$BITSTAMP:BTCUSD. Should we be worried or be exited about the price action of #Bitcoin. Looking at the price action of BTC we  can see that there is a lot going on in the market and some traders are really worried about the next move for Bitcoin. So looking at the current price action, we can clearly see that Bitcoin is forming a falling wedge pattern which is a bullish continuation patten, also if we look at the current price level of 53k, we can see that price has been experiencing some rejections at this area. If Bitcoin should bounce off from this price zone, we should see a retest of the 60k area but if fails and breaks below we should see a proper rejection from the 50k area.
Now the question is should we be worried about the 40k which stands as demand zone  which we could definitely see Bitcoin retest that area if it fails to hold support around the 50k level. looking at the price action and the fundamental activities like CPI, UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM  and many more, we should probably expect some huge volatility which either push the price down to 50k or up to 60k levels respectfully.  My suggestion to any who want to invest in Bitcoin or any other Cryptocurrency is for them to wait for proper rejection and support for Bitcoin.

I think the gapped up is a sign of funds flowing into the coin market.



The rise in USDT dominance is likely to lead to a decline in the coin market.

However, since funds flow into the coin market through USDT, I think that USDT dominance will show an upward trend in the medium to long term when considering it from a medium to long term perspective.

When funds flowing into the coin market purchase coins and tokens, USDT or USDC flow back into the exchange, which is expressed as a decline in USDT dominance.

Therefore, I think that in order for a large bull market in the coin market to begin, USDT dominance will start to decline after a large rise.


In that sense, the 4.97 point of USDT dominance is expected to be an important turning point.

If USDT dominance rises above 6.39, the coin market is likely to show a large decline.

I think that if it rises above 6.39 and then falls to the 4.97-6.39 range, the coin market is likely to form a bottom range.

My personal hope is that it will fall after receiving resistance near 6.39 ~ Fibonacci ratio 0.75.

If that happens, I think the coin market will already be on an uptrend before it is recognized as a bottom.

We need to see whether individual investors will recognize it as a bottom and give them a buying opportunity, or whether they will not give them a buying opportunity.


In that sense, I expect the volatility period around September 13 to be a meaningful period.


In fact, this volatility period is the period set on the 1W chart.

Therefore, the actual volatility period is the week before and after September 16.

In other words, if expressed as a 1-day period, it corresponds to September 9-29.

The strong support zone is expected to be around 42K-43K.

I think this is the zone that most people are expecting.

Therefore, if we give individual investors a buying opportunity as I mentioned earlier, I think it will touch around 42K-43K.

If we do not give individual investors a buying opportunity, it is expected to turn upward near the M-Signal indicator on the 1M chart.

In other words, it is expected to touch around the Fibonacci ratio of 0.707 (48064.07) ~ 0.786 (51606.42) and turn upward.

-

When looking at the NAS100USD chart, we need to check if the StochRSI indicator enters the oversold zone again when a new candle is created.

The important zone is the 17854.8 point.

If it falls below this point, it is likely to touch the Fibonacci ratio 0.618 (17141.4) on the right.

Therefore, I expect the trend to form after the volatility period of BTC that I mentioned earlier.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after it rises above 29K.

The expected range to touch in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23

5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

-----------------
TLDR: 
My base case is that next week, Bitcoin will make another LL. I expect volatility and at least one shakeout. Ultimately, Bitcoin will reach a low between 47K ‚Äì 49K. 
After making the low, bitcoin will begin a relief rally, lasting until after the Fed meeting on September 17th. My analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs reaction to the previous rate cut in 2020 points to a temporary relief rally and a resumption of the downtrend. However, this rally can be savage and even go beyond the previous high of 65K. 
If I am correct, next week will be extremely difficult to trade. My best bet is to wait for 49K to get hit and buy with low leverage or wait for a trend reversal confirmation. 
I realize I strayed from the conventional interpretation of a corrective WXYZ. Some of you were kind enough to reach out and offer your opinion. I will include these as alternative scenarios. 

 Bitcoin Macro Outlook: 

I believe Bitcoin is in the final stages of a complex wave four correction. After This correction period, I expect a continuation in wave five to around 80K. 
 Where do I draw the line? 
Price: A weekly close below 43.6K, which is the 0.618 of wave 3.
Time: if this correction lasts after October 2024.  
Figure 1: Macro Outlook. 
  
Figure 2: Bitcoin Correction Price & Time Limits. 
  

 Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook: 

The selling pressure on Bitcoin is close to exhaustion. However, I still expect the price to make an LL next week. 
I outlined the path the price will take. ‚ÄúNo plan survives first contact with the enemy‚Äù (Helmuth von Moltke). The vital part of the plan is for the price to make a double-bottom scenario at around 49K. Invalidation is next.
Figure 3: Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook. 
  

 Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook Invalidation: 

Bitcoin holds the trendline and advances in a triangle breakout. 
This scenario is less likely for two reasons:
1. Because of the violation of the Gann Angle (2/1). 
2. The daily wick from August 5th has yet to be filled. 
Figure 4: Bitcoin Short-Term Invalidation. 
  
Figure 5: Gann Angles & Wick Fill. 
  

 Time Over Price:  

Gann believed that "Time is the most important factor of all." He argued that when sufficient time has elapsed, it could overbalance price, leading to a change in market trends. 
My premise is that we are due for a short relief rally after next week. Whatever happens after September 14th, I will look for long trades. 

Best Wishes
I expect to see btc above 58k. Btc has rejected from Bullish break-out OB  on 50k and we have liquidity swap and bearish sentiment after NFP news. Let s see what happens $$$ . Good luck !

Is BTC aiming for another high? Looking on higher timeframe, bitcoin is creating a massive bullish flag and aiming 80k ne all time high. Will this create a massive move of the bulls? Still looking for some fundamentals that will trigger on this kind of move
We've been in this flag for a while. I am looking to capitalize on a retrace to past previous support zones on the weekly timeframes, 50-52k.

The last weekly candle had a strong engulfing close.   
The current weekly candle started pushing upwards which brings me to the overall play, a short once the weekly candle flips on itself and breaks the current low.

The current H4 chart is starting to align with the overall vision, same engulfing candle driving price down to the entry point zone. I usually expect the same "movement conditions" as the last time we were in a determined zone and from 57,000 to 54500 we should have a somewhat similar clean move down. My goal is to clear my risk once we go down to 54500. 

  

I am expecting the US rate cuts to drive the price further down to retest the 50-52 thousand range. The overall idea in the rate cuts is rather simple. A rate cut implies that more investment opportunities will then be "profitable" when compared to other investment vehicles, therefore a lot of people/banks that are holding to BTC for hedging purposes, will now be tempted to resume with other investments and thus driving down the price of BTCUSD.

Other major economies are expected to lower their marginal lending rates as well, so this can easily play out for a while. 

Interest Rate Cut dates:
 
 EUR / 12 Sept 2024
 CAD / 4 Sept 2024
 USD / 18 Sept 2024
 

If the first target is hit, then partials are to be taken out and a residual position will be left as a runner with a trailing stop.
The important support level at $53,600 should be kept for now.

 If the price reclaims $55,500 and consolidates, this will open the gates for $60,000

 If Bitcoin loses the $53,600 support and the price consolidates here,. $52,000 - $50,000 is just a matter of time.

 At worst, Bitcoin will retest $48,000 - $46,000

Looking at BITCOIN at rhf ytf, it zeems that its creating a massive hns pattern. Will this price action continje to a massive move? Sept will be a great month cor bitcoin? Lets see the next move
Unfortunately, despite having a bullish divergence in 4H timeframe and reaching the support zone of 54,600 - 56,100, #BTC didn't show the small pump that was expected! there's probably an underlying reason for this that we don't know yet but  maybe something is going to take place in the coming days!

Anyways, since the bullish divergence didn't work and BTC crossed below the lower trendline and the mentioned support zone in one big candle, it can be said that the sell pressure is indeed strong. The main scenario is that any upward move towards the mentioned area which is now a resistance is considered a retest and Sell/Short strategy should be applied. Secondary scenario is crossing above the resistance zone which isn't very likely at the moment.

As it's been stated over and over for the past few weeks, the overall trend/sentiment is indeed bearish and BTC is most probably heading for 45,000 and then 42,000 zones!
The color levels are very accurate levels of support and resistance in different time frames.
A strong move requires a correction to major support and we have to wait for their reaction in these areas.
If the BTC chart does not react to close levels, this analysis will be invalid.
So, Please pay special attention to the very accurate trend, colored levels, and you must know that SETUP is very sensitive.

BEST,
MT
My expectations from the previous post have materialized, and the price of Bitcoin has dropped again into the price imbalance zone below 53,500. My expectations for Bitcoin's price next week are as follows: due to negative economic news, the stock market will likely continue to decline for several more days starting on Monday. Since Bitcoin's price correlates with key indices like the S&P and Dow Jones, there is a high probability that Bitcoin will continue to decline, potentially reaching as low as 48,900.

If we look at the Long-Term Holder Realized Profit/Loss Ratio 7D indicator, which unfortunately is not yet available publicly on the TradingView platform, based on this data, Bitcoin is currently in an accumulation phase before a major growth season. Similar patterns occurred during the 2011 and 2021 market seasons.

i've used the Bitcoin chart on Binance because data shows me on coingecko it has the highest trading volume. 

**On the Monthly timeframe,**  ,  bearish divergence on the WaveTrend is spotted. even when Using another indicator like the RSI or MACD it will reveals the same divergence. This downward pressure is reflected in the current price action. The Fibonacci retracement from the last Higher Low to the Higher High gives us levels that are often respected; the first orderblock has been mitigated and coincides with an old Monthly level, which triggered an upward reaction. The support line, aligned with the 50 EMA, is a "critical" level that could be tested. Losing this level could cause a drop towards the  GETTEX:25K , it may sound unrealistic but is quite possible, given similar moves in the past and the current macroeconomic times globally. Yes i know its a +60% from ath but go check nov ‚Äò21 till nov ‚Äò22. like Mark Twain would say:  "History does'nt repeat himself but it often rhymes"  my message would be that its something you should keep in mind, just in case. 

**On the Weekly timeframe**,  , the WaveTrend shows that once it moves into the negative, strong upward moves often follow. The Stoch RSI is at low levels, which may create buying pressure. Although volume remains low, but previous price increases have also occurred under low volume conditions. The price still seems to be moving within the broadening wedge, and the support line could be retested. The price targets of the broadening wedge and the potential cup & handle formation are close to each other, though the volume for the cup isn't ideal, but I still want to consider the formation.

**On the Daily timeframe, **https://www.tradingview.com/x/SwOlrpl9 , after the All-Time High (ATH), a clear Change of Character (ChoCh) is visible, with lower highs and lower lows confirming the downtrend. What you're looking for is the break of this downward trend‚Äîthink of an upward break in structure by printing higher highs and higher lows. The previous two highs haven't been tapped yet, so I expect reactions at those levels.

**Conclusion:**
Depending on the support and resistance levels that are tested. Indicators like the WaveTrend and Stoch RSI suggest that a reversal is possible, but I still expect the lower support level to be tested as well. be Looking for the break of this downward trend‚Äîthink of an upward break in structure by printing higher highs and higher lows.

**Resistance levels:**
- $69,000 (a point of resistance)
- $73,777 (ATH)
- $85,300 (bullish TP from broadening wedge)

**Support levels:**
- $48,950 (Fibonacci 0.382)
- $47,000 (Weekly support/FVG)
- $37,330 (bearish TP from broadening wedge)

So, here we are. Hope these updates helped a little in navigating what has not been an easy market at all. Predicting these moves is near impossible, but we can look at possible zones and levels where we might interact with price and prepare for multiple scenarios.

We have cleaned up a lot of bad lows we had, only to sweep a previous low by $10. Technically that's a sweep, in reality it's not a very convincing one.

Open Interest declined a little bit, but not by any meaningful amount: there are still 30-40k contracts that opened during the $55-60k range, that's a bit troublesome still.

Previous plans:

It's a bit unclear, so we'll have to monitor as we go. Going by the squiggles, we lost GP and are now in the red path. On the other hand, we can see it as yellow that just went a little deeper.

It will depend a bit how much time we spend down here, but I'd disregard anything that happens over the weekend since price is just naturally drifting up to fill the imbalance we left.

Ideal scenario is the blue path I've added: sweep the recent low on Monday or Tuesday, but quick reclaim, then take out the bad highs around 60k. Then we take it from there.
the price is draining energy under fail value zone, Last night Daily candle closed as a low momentum green candle, it means the price is getting required to have a correction to low levels
BTCUSDT / 1D TIME FRAME

 HELLO TRADERS 

Tendency , prices is under upward pressure until prices trading above 52.047 .

The current upward pressure on prices is supported by the fact that they are trading above the key level of 52,047. Staying above this level signals continued bullish momentum, with projections suggesting potential gains toward 57,112 and eventually reaching 64,853, a key supply zone where sellers may step in. For the uptrend to be confirmed, prices need to break through this supply zone. 

However, if prices drop below the turning level of 52,047 and a daily or 4-hour candle closes beneath it, this would indicate a potential reversal. In such a case, prices could fall to 46,981, with further downside potential to 44,019. A confirmed downtrend would require prices to stabilize below the 46,981 support level, signaling stronger bearish sentiment.

 KEY LEVELS : 
 
 Turning Level : 52,047.
 Resistance Levels : 57,112 , 64,853.
 Support Levels : 46,981 , 44,019.
I suggest you sell all your bitcoins
The market is extremely bearish!
The annual candle has always been red after the halving! I emphasize always.
In the best case, he will see the price of 25,000 dollars and in the worst case, the price of Bitcoin will be 10,000 dollars.
After this, we can think about bitcoin above 100 or 150 thousand dollars!
Majority of retail traders are bullish for Q4, stating that the US Election will be bullish as Trump will be elected. 
Many are forgetting that leverage in the crypto market remains high according to Glassnode On-chain analytic data. 
Hedge funds and leveraged funds still remain majority short, whereas retail traders have added to long positions according to the latest CME COT report. 
As retail traders remain overwhelmingly bullish, trying to long every single falling knife, real capitulation has yet to happen. 
Although we may get a small bounce in the short term, I think this will be minimal. We will likely see 48k in September and then 41k later in October/November. 
Expecting Q1 2025 to be bullish and ATH may be exceeded in mid-2025 which goes against current consensus.
As Mentioned earlier,
It took a pullback till $52500 and formed a small resistance around $58500.

Breaking of $58500 resistance will lead it to $62k -  GETTEX:64K 

Otherwise,
It will again test $55k
If Bitcoin can break the middle line of the channel upwards, then it can be expected to break out of the channel for the first time.

Please note, this analysis is in a 4-hour time frame, and in higher time frames (1 day) stabilization should be done.

Currently, the market shows a greater desire for the price to be stable and not to fall further.

Right now the price needs to either get back inside the wedge it spilled out from, or create a lower low so we can rise to 66,000 to 70,000 range for the first half of September, and from there tumble down to create a lower low from $49,000 which should ideally complete this long, complex corrective pattern W-X-Y-X-Z for wave 4.
Nice to meet you. I'm Whale_signal

I updated 1H - BTCUSDT yesterday, and there's over $1,000 upside from orange whale indicators

Up to the peak of 58K, it's more than $3,000, and I've posted exactly this elsewhere


Today's 1H - BTCUSDT update

Even if it breaks above the 58K purple whale index, the direction will likely be different depending on the flow from the purple whale index around 59K to 59.2K

It looks like you need the power to break through 59K to 59.2K to get a foothold on the rise
It's an important whale indicator section


I'll stop here for today

this is a case for more sideeways well into 2025. this pennant ends in april 2025! scary stuff for hodlers and swing traders alike. only the best day traders who can somehow beat the bots (meaning no one on here) will survive. 

what do you make of this?

and bonus points if you can tell me the subject reference without googling...
Though bad news and bearish indicators, BTC still has possibility boost its price upto 68,500 

About Altcoins, you should refer the BTC.D seems likely make downturn trend that helps boost Altcoins
Bitcoin Update:

BTC closed below  GETTEX:54K  on the daily chart, bringing the price close to the support trendline. As expected, BTC has made a bearish move.

What‚Äôs next?

The $50.6K support, or around $50K, must hold to help BTC rebound and rally. The RSI is attempting to form a bullish divergence; if successful, it could be positive for BTC.

For now, all eyes are on the support range between $50K and $52.5K.

Hope this helps. Trade safely.

Best regards,

4H candle is closed very bullish!

The next important levels for BTC: 56,900 and 59,900
If we see bearish signs up there, we prepare for Sell/Short positions.
I have not charted in awhile as I got really busy doing some tech stuff, but as per the chart and some indicators, BTC going dip before pumping. Well, that's my perception only. Anything can happen from now.

But Let's attract BTC from now  :)
Btc has been in a downtrend, which moved into a parallel channel recently, Today it broke downwards out of that channel again, and continued along the downtrend trajectory.

However it has hit a point of consolidation, and now looks to be bouncing back up.

I predict we will come back up around $55k to retest the previous area of support, to confirm as resistance, therefore a quick scalp is on the table to the upside...

What I expected during the week and especially mentioned in yesterday's idea, happened today.
What was I looking for?
I was looking for a short sharp and fast position.
I only trade Sol, but I put the price action of Bitcoin as a reference.
For example:
Sol and Bitcoin prices were in the discount area before the New York session.
According to ICT concepts, the starting point of a good and sharp short (trigger point to enter the trade) is when the price is in the premium area.
In the New York session (between 10 and 11), the price of Bitcoin had touched 50% Fibo, but the price of Sol was a little far from reaching its 50% Fibo.
Therefore, when the price of Bitcoin reached 50% Fibo and its price started to go down,
In the Sol price chart, I looked for short setup and entry into the trade.
And as I expected, the price reached the target (122).
The duration of this trade was about 8 hours.
Wish you enjoy your trades in this week!
Happy Weekend!
That move was necessary and clears the way to move back up to 58k. It may even do it over the weekend. It's been holding price for a while and I feel like they may actually carry it out. The crypto market often does the unexpected. See you Monday!

 Hello Traders, 
 
 Despite positive economic sentiment, BTC still fluctuating inside the box.
 If the price stays above the yellow area, the green scenario is valid and after that if price breaks above the 65K level and stabilize there, 66690 and 70100 levels are the next price resistances.
 According to the recent market heatmap, some shadows may occur inside the circle area for some market liquidation.
 

 Stay tuned for more updates.

‚û°Ô∏èAt present, we are near the resistance zone and the downward trend line, and there is an expectation of resistance and a fall, so even if we are bullish, we need to wait for a period of correction before participating. The next strong resistance is near 57.3k.

Hi there,

BTCUSDT appears bearish on the H1 chart, indicating a bias of 54001.88 below 55825.34. The nearest support line is at 54862.55.

If the price breaks above 57666.36, the setup will be considered invalid.

Technical Analysis of the Chart by Bla≈æ Fabjan: 

 Descending Trading Channel: 

BTC is trading within a descending channel, showing lower highs and lower lows, which typically signals a downtrend. However, it is nearing the bottom of the channel, often a zone for potential reversal.

 Support and Resistance Zones: 

Support: The two orange zones indicate strong support areas around $51,000 and $50,000. BTC may find buying pressure in these regions, especially as it touches the lower bound of the descending channel.
Resistance: The current resistance area is around $55,000. BTC will need to break through this level to confirm a trend reversal.

 Indicators: 

RSI (Relative Strength Index): RSI is currently around 55, indicating a neutral trend. However, it is slightly moving upwards, suggesting potential bullish momentum, though not overbought yet.
Stochastic Oscillator: This is showing a crossover at 74, indicating upward momentum, but it‚Äôs close to the overbought region. This may signal some resistance to immediate bullish continuation.

VMC Cipher B Divergences: This indicator is showing bullish divergences at several points, signaling potential reversal zones. Divergence with price action suggests a potential trend change in the near term.

 Trading Plans: 

 1. Intraday Trading Plan: 
Strategy:
Trade within the current channel. Watch for a breakout from the descending channel, especially on the 1-hour chart.
A breakout above the $55,000 level could confirm a short-term bullish move.
Look for pullbacks towards the $53,500-$54,000 region to enter long positions, targeting $55,500.
Place a stop loss just below $53,000 to protect against fake breakouts.
Indicators to Watch:
RSI trending above 60.
Stochastic Oscillator maintaining bullish momentum.

 2. Scalping Strategy: 
Strategy:
Focus on small price fluctuations within the support and resistance zones.
Look for quick entries near the support zones (around $53,500) and exits before it hits resistance ($55,000).
Scalping in tight time frames (5 to 15 minutes) around these price levels.
Key Levels:
Enter around $53,500 and exit at $54,500.
Place tight stop-loss orders around $53,000 to manage risk.

 3. Swing Trading Strategy: 
Strategy:
If BTC continues trading within this descending channel, wait for a breakout confirmation to take a long position.
A breakout above the channel and $55,500 would signal a strong move upwards, potentially to $58,000 or higher.
Enter long positions if BTC breaks and holds above the $55,500 resistance level, targeting $58,000 and beyond.
In case of a further dip, enter long positions around $50,000 support, which appears to be a strong reversal point.
Stop Loss: Below $50,000.

 Conclusion and Long Position Advice: 

Near-Term (Intraday): BTC could break above the descending channel, leading to a short-term bullish move towards $55,500. Watch closely for a breakout confirmation. You could consider entering long positions on pullbacks or a confirmed breakout.

Medium-Term (Swing Trading): A solid break of the $55,500 resistance could lead to a potential rally towards $58,000. Be cautious of potential false breakouts and place stop-losses below support levels.

Scalping: For those aiming for quicker profits, you can take advantage of price fluctuations within the $53,500-$55,000 range.

Overall, the chart shows signs of a potential bullish reversal, especially if BTC breaks out of the descending channel. For now, conservative traders may wait for a breakout confirmation before entering long positions. However, aggressive traders can consider buying near support levels, keeping in mind the risk of downward movement in case of failure to break resistance.

Hello traders, today after the US data released, crypto market collapse started, and reached around 53k, and my analysis for crypto is to touch 48k then moving towards 80k or above... after breaking the high of 74k ...


enjoy trading!
Market filled its inefficiency resting at 55.3k as weekly closes.

Late shorters are getting stopped out. 

If traders keep on shorting, a squeeze toward 56k area is very likely.

Reaction at 56k level will be really telling and where the FOMO buyers would be piling in.

 Area of Interest: 
Wait for a valid retest on ltf demand 53.7k to 53.3k targeting single prints/poor highs or if price can get toward resting liquidity above marginally lower highs.

 Possible Targets: 
56.7k
58.3k
60.2k
According to the chart, it seems that Bitcoin has completed a flat correction pattern. Two high-probability support areas consisting of overlapping different Fibonacci percentages are marked with green areas on the chart. This flat pattern will likely end in one of these areas. Given that the price has entered the first support zone, any price increase above the end of wave iv confirms the start of the third bullish wave of Bitcoin. I expect the start of a powerful uptrend in the coming days and even hours.
The open interest at 54K is weak chances this will fall through to 48K before pulling back to 52K by tomorrow. However September bleeding just repeat the history again. Nothing new.
BTC is in a range before market opening and i think there is correction to higher level after this bearish trend,and next we will dump to low levels
Real traders know that we never say never. These are real levels with many touch points of data that we want to use when looking left. Its possible we come down to 30 k or lower. I know im going to get heckled by the moonboys. "oh bro jus hodl. 1 billion dollar btc programmed bro" uh no little timmy. Btc and crypto need to stitch together real levels of support and put in a base before any real movement higher. 
Just remember dont get cocky kid. It can crash harder and can soar higher thn any other asset . its completely tied to liquidity and rn. Things look bad in the markets on a global scale. A time will come when we go to new highs, but rn its not. I do prefer the gold chart as it paints the real picture. Bitcoin has set in a lower high against gold. I would pay attention to that chart as well.
Crypto is all momentum. remember that. both to the up and down
Technical Analysis: 

 1. Key Support and Resistance Levels: 
 
 The price is approaching a key support zone at $55,000, which has acted as a crucial level in previous bounces. A hold at this level could signal a potential bullish reversal.
 On the other hand, the $65,000 resistance level serves as the next critical barrier for the price to break. A confirmed breakout above this zone could open the door for a stronger bullish continuation.
 

 2. Price Action and Consolidation: 
 
 The current price action shows that the price is consolidating near the bottom of a defined channel, which has historically acted as a zone of strong support.
 If the price remains above $55,000, it could signal that liquidity at previous lows has been taken, clearing the path for a bullish push towards the $65,000 level.
 

 3. Momentum Indicators: 
 
 The momentum indicator shows signs of a previous bullish regular divergence, suggesting that although momentum has decreased recently, a bounce from the $55,000 support could reignite bullish momentum.
 There is also a prior crossover around the zero line, indicating that momentum could shift back in favor of the bulls if the price stabilizes and rises from current levels.
 

 4. Bullish Scenario: 
 
 The bullish scenario depends on price maintaining above $55,000. If the price bounces from this support and gains enough momentum to break through $65,000, we could see a stronger bullish continuation toward higher levels.
 It's important to wait for confirmation of the breakout above $65,000 before entering long positions, as this would solidify the bullish reversal.
 

 5. Conclusion: 
 
 BTC/USDT is in a critical position, with the $55,000 support level playing a key role in determining the next move. If the price holds and rebounds, the bullish scenario becomes more likely, with $65,000 as the next resistance target.
 Traders should closely monitor the support zone and look for potential confirmation before taking positions. A break below $55,000 could invalidate the bullish setup, requiring a reassessment.

The current market setup can be described as 'Waiting for Godot'. But in contrast to the Samuel Beckett play, markets are awaiting the Federal Reserve to finally start cutting interest rates. And hopefully, also unlike in the actual play, the wait will not be eternal.

Over the past week, market sentiment dropped even further. Jitters about the slowing US economy and rumours, later denied by the company, of a subpoena by the Department of Justice issued to AI stock darling Nvidia over antitrust matter led traditional markets downwards. Crypto markets quickly followed suit. Bitcoin has foreshadowed the slow slide downwards of the wider crypto market.

Ever since Bitcoin lost its parabolic momentum earlier in the year, it has trended down, first towards the $60k support. Once Bitcoin breached through the $60k level, and in the absence of any new positive momentum, we are now looking at the $50k price mark. Optimism right now is hard to come by for most traders.

The upcoming US jobs report for August has created further expectations of possible doom and gloom. Economists expect that the August jobs report will show that the labor market is cooling, but not dramatically. Consensus estimates are for a net gain of 160,000 jobs, which would be an increase over July‚Äôs estimated 114,000 gain according to FactSet estimates.

The outcome of the August jobs report will be an important driver for the extent to which the Federal Reserve will cut rates. The decision is both critical and difficult. Cut rates too much and markets could start raising inflation expectations. Do not cut them enough and the economy could weaken further as businesses reel from high rates on their debt. Whatever they do, the impact of lower rates will take time to show effects. In the meantime, markets can continue to struggle.

A final unknown variable in this setup are the upcoming US elections. It is likely that weaker economic performance will hurt the chances of the incumbent administration. Crypto markets clearly favour a Trump presidency due to his recently discovered pro-crypto stance. Not even the best analysts can predict the full extent of the the 2nd and 3rd order impacts of a weakening economy, possible rate cuts and a US election that is on knife's edge. Markets hate uncertainty. Unfortunately there seems to be plenty more of it to come before traders can finally start to look upwards once more.

üîªüîªFor the price to continue its decline towards the first target (50096.10-52489.40), the daily candle must close below 55606.00‚úÖ

‚ÄºÔ∏èTarget 1 aligns well with the bottom of the weekly bearish channel, and there is potential for a bearish divergence confirmation at this support zone if the price declines.

üôÖTherefore, we consider Target 1 as the maximum drop potential. There is a high probability of a bottom forming and an bull-trend starting from this area‚úÖüöÄ

üîªüîªüîªHowever, if the divergence is negated, meaning the MACD forms a lower low, Bitcoin could continue its decline towards Target 2 (41218.20)üòê

This is my idea of possible will happen to BTC

The price is currently creating liquidity at the ltf and possible to touch the breaker Order block at demand zone. Once the price taps into the order block to the demand zone, there's a possible to bullish.

Or 

If the price will continue go up to make break of structure, I think the price will tap the 4H order bock
Btc correction in weekly  and ready for heavy Pump üöÄüöÄ
Bitcoin Mid-Term Analysis If the interest rate cut is done and the US economy does not stagnate, and of course President Trump wins the US election, I will share other possible scenarios for Bitcoin in the coming days.
Reason for entry:

1. Structure breakdown (bos 1h)
2. Fair value gap (fvg 1h)
3. Momentum (9 bar short, 20 long).
Strength on the seller's side.
4. Liquidity capture within the fvg 4h interest zone.
Technical Analysis: 

 1. Price Rebound and Market Structure: 
 
 The price action shows a clear bullish rebound within a significant demand zone, aligning with the 61.8% - 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels of the previous bullish impulse. This area has historically acted as a strong support, and the current price movement suggests a potential continuation to the upside.
 The overall market structure remains bullish, as confirmed by the recent break of structure (BOS), indicating that buyers are still in control of the trend.
 

 2. Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs): 
 
 The EMAs are aligned favorably for a bullish continuation, acting as dynamic support for the price. The price has consistently bounced from these EMAs, suggesting that they remain critical for the continuation of the uptrend.
 As long as the price holds above the EMAs, the bullish structure remains intact, and the trend is likely to extend further.
 

 3. Momentum and Hidden Bullish Divergence: 
 
 A hidden bullish divergence is evident on the momentum indicator, indicating that while momentum has decreased slightly, price action remains strong. This suggests a continuation signal despite the temporary slowdown in momentum.
 Additionally, there is a potential bullish crossover forming, which could act as another signal for upward movement. This confluence of signals points towards further gains in the near term.
 

 4. Key Levels and Fibonacci Zones: 
 
 The Fibonacci retracement zones (61.8% and 78.6%) are crucial levels where price has found support. As long as these levels hold, the probability of a move towards new highs increases.
 Potential upside targets include previous resistance levels near $85,000 and further towards $92,000 if the bullish scenario plays out.
 

 5. Conclusion: 
 
 With strong support from EMAs, bullish market structure, and key Fibonacci levels acting as support, the outlook for BTC/USDT remains bullish. Momentum indicators also suggest that this trend is likely to continue.
 Traders should keep an eye on potential breakouts from resistance levels, with possible targets at $85,000 and $92,000. However, should the price fall below the current support levels, a reevaluation of the trend would be necessary.

Hello, traders.

Have a nice day today.

The key is whether it can rise after receiving support around 56150.01-56950.56.

Even if it doesn't rise, if it doesn't fall below the short-term downtrend line, I think it has a chance of rising.

If it falls below 56150.01,
1st: 52137.67
2nd: M-Signal on the 1M chart
You should check for support around the 1st and 2nd above.


Due to the rise of USDC, the trend of the coin market is moving in line with the stock market.

I think the launch of ETF products is affecting the coin market.


Looking at the Nasdaq 100 futures chart, the key is whether it can be supported near the important section of 1.902 (18788.2) ~ 0.786 (18898.9).

If it is not supported in this section,
1st: 18250.3
2nd: 17854.8
We need to check whether there is support near the 1st and 2nd sections above.


If the decline continues, it is expected to ultimately fall to around 16000-17000.

I think the launch of ETF products has laid the foundation for the coin market to transform into a sound investment market.

However, I think that this has led to irregular effects on the coin market, which had been reflecting the flow of indicators well.


The BW indicator touched the 0 point on the BTCUSDT chart.

And, with this decline, it was about to change to the state of StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, but it has changed back to the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA.

Because of this, there is a possibility of movement after June 18, so caution is required when trading.

The next volatility period is around September 13, so if it moves sideways around 56K before that, it is judged that there is a possibility of a trend reversal.

Have a good time.
Thank you.

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after rising above 29K.

The section expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

Since I think it can create a new trend in the overshooting section, I need to check the movement when this section is touched.

#BITCOIN

Bitcoin is moving in a descending channel on the 4-hour frame and the price has reached a strong support area in green at $57,200

There are rising loads from the current support level but it needs upward momentum to be able to reach the targets

Entry price $58,000

First target $60,257

Second target $62,236

Third target $64,000

The pattern is canceled if the support level in green at $57,200 is broken

In that case, the price will be heading to $54,100, which is a strong support level

wxy-abc-wxy corrective waves are a lesser known waveform that should be familiar to the og Elliot wave traders from the 2000s. The current chart of BTC is following the same Elliot counts as the charts of SPX and NDX from 2009-2011. 
Often times, hedge fund trading algorithms 'map out' price patterns following these waveforms and if this is correct, the wxy pattern should end soon, and the final y leg has likely started or is about to start. 
If this is true, the bottom should be below 49k, and as per my OB analysis, this lies between 41k to 43k.
#Bitcoin Update | Saturday, 07.09.2024

Good Morning to All Brothers and Sisters,

#Bitcoin dropped as predicted in my last analysis, touching nearly all support levels. It found support at the bottom of our yellow area, and the working week closed there. Now, the key point is where the Sunday weekly candle will close. In my opinion, it's time for a trend reversal.

What's Next?

In my view, the price will likely remain within the FRD line until tomorrow. After that, we may see a retracement. If the price crosses the second resistance (blue and black lines), this will confirm the trend reversal. Otherwise, if the price breaks below the yellow area, it could drop further.

#ALTS

There has been significant bleeding in altcoins, but after Bitcoin breaks through the first resistance, I will start providing new signals on #ALTS. Make sure to activate your notifications and stay tuned.

Wishing you all a great weekend!
I think BTC will retest to Weekly and Monthly Open levels. If its move that, i will make a short setup.
Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase this September, with a Descending Broadening Wedge pattern forming on both the weekly and daily charts. This pattern typically signals potential volatility, and we are now approaching the descending support trendline, which also aligns with the wick from the sharp price dump on August 5th. This region, around 48K, is likely to be tested in the coming days as the market seeks to sweep liquidity.

 Key Support Zones to Watch:  
Crucial Support Zone 1: The first line of defense. If Bitcoin holds here, we could start seeing signs of bullish momentum returning.
Crucial Support Zone 2: A deeper level of support. Breaking below this zone could lead to a more extended bearish trend.

In the event that these levels are broken and confirmation bearish candles start forming, we could see Bitcoin testing 42K, 40K, and even 36K in the weeks ahead. However, if Bitcoin holds these zones and begins to print higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL), it would be an early sign that the downtrend might be over.

Also an important element in this setup is the 100-day EMA, which aligns perfectly with Crucial Support Zone 2. This adds a layer of confidence that the price may find strong support here. The confluence of the 100-day EMA with this key support level suggests that a touch of this zone could trigger the next major move, potentially kickstarting a rally.

 Strategy for Traders: 
Swing Traders/Spot Traders: Pay close attention to the support zones, as these levels could present excellent buying opportunities. A bounce from these areas might indicate the start of a new rally, so it‚Äôs time to prepare and fill your bags.

Scalpers: Be mindful of the resistance zones. The price may spike slightly before retesting lower levels, providing potential shorting opportunities. Watch closely for a "soft" or "hard" landing around 50K-48K.

 Caution: Bull Trap Alert 
If Bitcoin encounters a pump in the near term, be cautious about falling into a bull trap. All signs currently point to a retest of the 50K and 48K zones as highly probable, so don‚Äôt get caught up in premature optimism.

#Bitcoin  is holding above the 54k support level.
As long as we remain above this level, we're in a good position. However, if BTC breaks below 54k, the next support is around 42k.
Hello, this is Chartist.

Bitcoin has been in a continuous downtrend since reaching the $65,000 level, without any significant rebound. 

Currently, it has declined by around 19% from its previous high, forming a bottom around the $52,500 level.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has remained in the "extreme fear" range at 22-23 over the past two days, highlighting heightened market anxiety.

Now, the key question is whether Bitcoin can stage a rebound from this point. 

Based on the current technical indicators, I believe there is potential for a recovery.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the analysis.

 < Chart Analysis > 



I‚Äôve used RSI, CCI, and Stochastic indicators on this chart, and all three are showing positive signals after exiting oversold conditions.

1. RSI(Relative Strength Index) : An indicator measuring buying pressure. Currently recovering from oversold levels, signaling a possible price rebound.

2. CCI(Commodity Channel Index) : Used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. It‚Äôs moving out of the oversold zone, which indicates upward momentum.

3. Stochastic : A short-term indicator that predicts price reversals. It‚Äôs recovering from the oversold region, further suggesting the likelihood of a technical rebound.

Typically, when these indicators show recovery, the price tends to move toward the middle line of the Bollinger Bands (the red line on the chart). 

However, since this middle line could serve as resistance, it‚Äôs crucial to monitor how the price reacts upon reaching it.


 < Summary > 

- Bitcoin has dropped from $65,000, establishing a bottom around $52,500. 

- Technical indicators such as RSI, CCI, and Stochastic are all signaling recovery from oversold conditions, indicating a potential rebound. 

- It will be important to watch if the middle line of the Bollinger Bands acts as a resistance level during this rebound.

Best of luck with your investments!

BTC Losing Bullish Momentum 

In our previous analysis, BTC performed as expected, creating a correction. 
This was the ideal scenario before the onset of a bearish wave.

Today, the release of the US PCE data could potentially drive BTC lower.

Last night, BTC tested the $61K resistance zone, which was close to our reversal zone, increasing the likelihood of a bearish movement.

If everything goes as anticipated, BTC should test the $56.1K and $50K levels.

 You may find more details in the chart!
Thank you and Good Luck!

A great deal of viewers have contacted me asking how I "time" the market. In other words, once I've identified a market as "set up" (via COT strategy or Valuation Strategy), how do I get into a trade.

This video is the first in a series that will outline the entry techniques that I use.
 
18 PERIOD MOVING AVERAGE ENTRY METHOD: 

By far, this method is the safest change of trend confirmation that you will find. There are other entry techniques that will get you into the market sooner, sure. But those other entry techniques come with greater risk, and could be called "bottom picking" to some degree. 

The 18 Period MA Entry Method is simple.

 STEP 1:  Plot the 18 period SMA on your chart based on the closing price.

 STEP 2:  For  LONGS , you need to see two full range candles form  ABOVE  the MA. From there, mark out the highest high of those 2 candles. When price trades up into that high, the trend has officially changed to bullish. For  SHORTS , you need to see to full range candles form  BELOW  the MA. From there, mark out the lowest low of those 2 candles. When price trades down into that low, the trend has officially changed to bearish. 

 CAVEAT:  We  do not count inside bars  (bars that form within the range of the previous candle). If you see inside bars, skip them and continue your 2 bar count.

 STEP 3:  Enter at market when high/low is breached. Risk management is something I will review in another video, but generally, I add/subtract 120%-150% of the 3 bar ATR.

 CLARIFICATION:  To be clear, this entry technique should not be traded blindly.  You need to have a REASON to take the trade  (for example, COT strategy suggests a market is setup for a trade, or the Valuation/Ducks in a Barrel setup suggests a market is setup for a trade). 

 CREDIT:  I credit Larry Williams, Tom DeMark, Brian Schad & Jake Bernstein for their influence in these ideas.

If you have any questions about this entry technique, feel free to shoot me a message.

Good Luck & Good Trading.
This is a shot in the dark for the weekend.

Weekend scam pump?

Let's see if history repeats and this sell-off was to provide a platform to squeeze profits out of longs into resistance at the take profit zone.

May the Lord Almighty have mercy on our souls.
If you notice from the arrows, all BTC has done is reach lower high after lower high. So my expectation is that it will descend lower to the liquidity shown in the 48k. I see no reason why it would suddenly rise higher and not grab that sell side liquidity first! 

This is simply an opinion, not financial advice of any kind!
Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Observing the chart, we can see that the price entered an upward channel, where it in a short time rose to the resistance level, which coincided with the seller zone, broke it, and continued to move up. But later it made a correction to the 64500 level, after which made an upward movement and then made a strong impulse down, thereby exiting from the channel and breaking the 64500 and 55700 levels. Also then, the price started to trades inside the wedge, where it at once turned around from the support line and rebounded higher than the 55700 level, which coincided with the buyer zone, breaking this level again. Next, the price made a retest and continued to rise to the resistance level, and when it reached it, BTC turned around and dropped to the support level. But a not long time ago it started to move up and I think that Bitcoin can rebound from the support line and start to grow to the resistance line of the wedge. For this case, I set my TP at 62100 points, which coincides with the resistance line. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ

We have entered a long position on BTC/USDT on the 4-hour timeframe after the trade was triggered at a key support level. The strategy is to leverage this 4-hour support zone with the goal of targeting the previous high. We will be actively monitoring this trade and making adjustments as the price action unfolds.

Key Levels:

	‚Ä¢	Entry: Initiated at the current support level on the 4-hour chart, where buyers have historically stepped in.
	‚Ä¢	Target: Aiming for a move towards the previous high, where the price may encounter resistance.
	‚Ä¢	Stop-Loss: Placed below the support level to protect against further downside risk, ensuring a favorable risk-to-reward ratio.

Rationale:
This trade is based on the assumption that the 4-hour support will hold, providing a springboard for a move back towards the previous high. The technical setup aligns with a potential bullish reversal, but we remain cautious given the market‚Äôs volatility.

Risk Management:
We will be actively monitoring this position, ready to adjust stop-loss levels and take partial profits as the trade progresses. The focus is on managing risk effectively while capitalizing on the potential upside.

 Note: Please remember to adjust this trade idea according to your individual trading conditions, including position size, broker-specific price variations, and any relevant external factors. Every trader‚Äôs situation is unique, so it‚Äôs crucial to tailor your approach to your own risk tolerance and market environment.

üìäWhere is the next support zone for #BTC ‚ùì

üß†Although there was a strong rise today due to the stimulation of the news, a long structure was not established on the hourly chart, so I cautiously maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Today's trend is very similar to yesterday's trend. They both rose sharply and then fell sharply. The difficulty of trading has increased a lot, so please be sure to do a good job in risk management.

‚û°Ô∏èAt present, we have fallen below the staged support area, and the next strong support area is 50k-52k, which deserves our focus.

In the trading universe, whether you choose to buy, sell, or hold, remember that patience isn't just a virtue; it's your superpower. It's what keeps you from jumping into a wormhole just because it's there. So, equip yourself with analysis, arm yourself with strategy, but most importantly, cloak yourself in patience. In the grand space opera of trading, those who wait often find the best planets to land on. 

And always keep in mind, as any space trader would tell you, "In the market, as in space, timing isn't everything; it's the only thing."

Follow this week and take long opportunities; There is a stop signal in the range of 55253-53894, so you can go long. If we directly break through the current resistance and wait for high altitude
Bitcoin is looking good in a smaller timeframe as well, where the price is still dropping after our recent rejection from the zone of EMAs. 

We are now waiting for sudden drop to happen which would seperate the EMAs and market price for some time (which would give a possibility for a correction to stabilise the EMAs).

There have been no changes regarding  Bitcoin . We reached the local buyer's zone of $56,700-$56,000, but there was no strong market reaction, except for the accumulation of large volumes.

At the moment, we can also expect liquidity removal and testing of higher levels, but only within the local picture. The second option is a continued decline within the downward trendline to the next buyer's zone.
For now, it's better to wait for the resolution and not open medium-term positions.

 Buying zones:  $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies), level $48,000.

 Selling zones:  level: $58,700-$59,400 (mirrored volume zone, with offset), $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes).

 Interesting altcoins. 

Currently, the market is full of uncertainty, and it's worth trading coins only in an intraday format, without global targets.
For the  APTUSDT  coin, we have a strong selling zone of $0.65-$0.658; open a short position if there's a reaction.
Bitcoin  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  Update

This appears to be a similar RSI divergence failure as seen in the past. To invalidate this, BTC needs to cross $58,500 before the end of this week.
just want to see BTC in micro perspective. if this bits plays out, then BTC will show a bit of compliance. but who knows
Current Analysis: BTC/USDT is trading within a descending channel on the 2-hour chart, suggesting that Bitcoin is in a short-term downtrend. However, BTC is currently testing the lower boundary of the channel and is showing signs of a potential bounce.

 The lower boundary of the channel is around $56,200 - $56,500.
The upper boundary of the channel near $58,500 - A breakout above this could confirm a bullish reversal.

Monitor for an increase in volume, which could signal the strength of the move if BTC attempts to break out of the channel.
RSI: Currently in a neutral zone, suggesting no immediate overbought or oversold conditions.

 A breakout above $58,500 with strong volume could trigger a move towards the next resistance levels around $60,000 and beyond.
Continued Downtrend: If BTC fails to break out and loses the $56,200 support level, it could continue to trend lower within the channel, targeting $55,000 or even lower.
Trading Plan:

Consider entering a long position on a confirmed breakout above the channel with a target of $60,000 and a stop loss just below the breakout level.
If BTC fails to hold the lower boundary and breaks below $56,200, consider shorting with a target of $55,000 and a stop loss above $57,000.

 This is not financial advice. Keep a close watch on BTC's price action for rapid changes, and adjust your strategy as necessary. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you!
Greetings, everyone.üòâ

I would like to present a scenario for your consideration, grounded in  "Elliott Wave Theory" .

 

 ‚úîÔ∏è Wave initiated from the 15K level: Classified as a "Double Zigzag"
‚úîÔ∏è Current wave in development: Y-c-3
‚úîÔ∏è Projected upward range: 93K ~ 101K 

The rationale behind this analysis is as follows:

 
 Zigzag patterns typically move within a parallel channel.
 The first zigzag wave, which started from the 15K level, adhered precisely to this parallel channel.
 As a result, the likelihood of a complex correction occurring is considerably high.
 

Based on these observations, I have constructed this particular scenario. It is an illustrative representation of potential market behavior, grounded in established technical principles. Wishing you all the best of luck.

 
 This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
 It is a personal perspective and should be used for reference only.
 All decisions and responsibilities lie with you.

Bitcoin is witnessing a complex structure and the amount of false breaches. History is redrawing itself. We may witness a sharp decline soon. I also remind you that this is not a recommendation. This is just a technical analysis. Good luck to everyone
nasdaq had the same confermation before break the top of december 2021 , btc on accumulation and it's prepare for a big movement up , 
this boring movment and go up and down , it's just to make ppl disbleaf in this market and to let ppl sell thier coin , not all ppl will get rich .
 don't be greedy . don't but your all eggs in one basket
this is my analyse it's not a recomandation to buy or sell !!

Looks like BTC is attempting a reversal from a Double Bottom pattern on the 2-hour chart. The price has formed two significant bottoms around the $55,000 mark, and we‚Äôre now seeing an early breakout above the descending trendline. If this pattern holds, the target is around $62,000. The RSI is hovering in the neutral zone, suggesting there's room for upward momentum, while the MACD is starting to turn bullish, signaling potential buy pressure building up. Watch out for any pullbacks that hold above $55,000 for confirmation.
If Price respect my Marked zone, Then we'll expect clear direction to upwards.
Still no confirmation for clear direction.

üìä#BTC Bullish Head and Shoulders Structure‚ùì

üß†From a structural perspective, we encountered obstacles after completing the goal of the long structure. Yesterday we also emphasized the strong resistance near 58250. Today we saw the opportunity to build a bearish double top structure near the selling zone and entered a short trade. At present, the goals of this structure have been fully achieved and the short order has been closed. If you opened a short position near strong resistance yesterday, you should reduce or close your position now.

‚û°Ô∏èCurrently we are in a position where the support zone and the buy zone overlap, which is considered the heaviest support zone. If we rebound from here and can break through the inflection point of 58500, then we have the opportunity to build a bullish head and shoulders structure. If this The structure holds, then we may be able to reverse the downward trend.

# Bitcoin Update on Thursday, 05.09.2024

Assalamu Alaikum and good morning to all brothers and sisters!

# Bitcoin continues to drop, as I mentioned in yesterday's analysis. In this chart, I have drawn the exact reversal points by price (see arrows #6, #5, #4). Once again, the price is typically in a downtrend/range. However, a catalyst can reverse the trend. Otherwise, the price may continue in the same direction.

# ALTS
# Altcoins are dropping as usual, more than Bitcoin. At the moment, there are no buy trades. We can look for sell trades later. I will share some sell trades in the group later, Insha'Allah.

I wish you all a very nice day.

An ascending triangle (conditionally bullish) is forming. The percentages of its realization and key support/resistance levels are shown. Similarly, key reversal levels are highlighted in yellow and indicated with arrows. 

The Gann fan is also constructed to understand the dynamic support/resistance areas of the trend as the price movement develops in the future. 

Remember, this is a phase of Dow Theory ‚Äî participation, i.e. majority participation. I suggest paying attention to altcoins that are not caught up in the news backdrop.

Addition to the Previous Idea on Bitcoin: Local Timeframe Analysis

On the local timeframe, a range has formed, with a support level below that is acting as a liquidity zone. I anticipate that once this liquidity is taken out, the price will reach the order block on the 4-hour timeframe and then aim for the previous week's high.
In today's SETUP, we're facing a similar market scenario as we did yesterday, but with exciting new opportunities on the horizon. One of the key setups we're looking at is the retracement long, offering a fresh chance to capitalize on market movements.

On a smaller timeframe, we see that while price is seeing some struggle to secure fully the zone, we are still below major EMAs and price is seeing pressure from sellers, which can be seen clearly here with that re-test that rejected the buyers.

We are looking for the price to secure that zone by tomorrow, if not today so keep an eye on it; once we see it, we should be good for downward movement.

As I mention in my BITCOIN BTC 2024 PREDICTIONS book, on 12 September bitcoin starts climbing, due to the kendra positions of Moon and Mars; and of Sun and Jupiter respectively in the sky.

  

I See the most likely scenario being that bitcoin drops to 49K and bounces upwards from there on 11th and 12th September. 

 BINANCE:BTCUSDT  

May This Galaxy Bless All.
Bitcoin is moving within an ascending channel. The lower band of the channel is being tested severely.

If the price maintains its upward trend, it is highly likely to rise above $100,000.

If the price shows weakness here, declines may deepen to $38,000.

Will the Bulls or the Bears win?

I am a bull.

üëâ I Closed All Account Management Positions Here The At The Entry Price
üî• Patient Is The Key, The BITCOIN Price Exactly Did  What I Expected From 64k , We Had a Perfect Dump To The 56k Area As My Main Target For This Corrective Move  

üìà Currently The Pattern Formed At Chart Is a Ending Diagonal And The Price Perfectly Bounced From The 1.618% PRZ, I Expect a Breakout From 57300$ And 59k Resistance Levels To The 67500$ And 70k As Next Main Targets 

üëâ Totally As Long As The Price Playing Above The 55k The Main Trend Is Bullish

Happy Trade!
Traders bought into new near highs prices and paid for it.

  
Being burned twice there may be no volume at the two previous tops so will the MM retrace further for cheaper and cheaper longs or has he absorbed and wants to move higher?
Hi dear traders 
Price breakout the bearish trend line and is now testing it as support. 
If it holds the 57161 area, we expect it to attack the 60k resistance. 
Otherwise, the next support zone is 55137.
Let's see what happens 
This is not financial advice ( DYOR  )
Good luck üëç
So I just opened a bitcoin short. I think this is a good price for an early entry.

Am anticipating a similar aggressive push down similarly to what we had yesterday around these same prices.

First potential take profit is  $56600 but am aiming for at 75% close at $55000

Full close at $54000 give trade plays out. The odds are in my favor because trade aligns with my edge ticking  enough boxes.

I'll make follow up updates in the comment.

Stop is above $58551, hopefully its enough based on my calculations.

The move should start now leading into the next few hours
BTCUSDT - update
As seen here we going down Arrow Markers show significant Levels.
Those are sort term targets (lower one).
Hello everyone, let's look at the 4H BTC to USDT chart, in this situation we can see the price keeps below the downtrend line.
  Let's start by setting goals for the near future, which include:

Target 1 59354 $
Target 2 61918 $
Target 3 65572 $ 
Target 4 70217 $


  Now let's move on to the stop-loss in case the market continues to decline:
 

Stop loss= 56,828 $
  Stop loss = 54,943 $
  Stop loss= 52,196 $
AND
  Stop loss = 48,733 $

Looking at the RSI indicator, we see
That it is approaching the upper limit again, which may result in a price recovery in the coming hours.
Alternative scenario how to get long on BTC and crypto if we don't get capitulation soon
Just what I would like to see not what will happen
1. Market Structure:
   - MSS (Market Structure Shift): The chart indicates a shift in market structure (MSS) at the marked point. This typically indicates a potential change in the market's direction, possibly from bearish to bullish or vice versa.

2. Liquidity Zones:
   - Liquidity: There is a horizontal line labeled "Liquidity" at a higher price level. This suggests that the trader is eyeing a potential price movement towards this area where liquidity might be resting, which could be targeted by large market players.
   - Ext. Liquidity (External Liquidity): The area at the bottom (marked as "Ext. Liquidity") could represent an area of interest where sell-side liquidity might be present. This is possibly a support zone where the price may reverse after liquidity is taken.

3. Entry Zone:
   - The chart highlights a gray shaded area (just above the external liquidity) as an "Entry" zone. This is where the trader plans to enter a long position, expecting the price to rise from this support level.

4. Target Zone:
   - Take Profit (TP) Level: The target zone is marked with a blue rectangle, stretching to the liquidity level. This area indicates where the trader expects to exit the trade, anticipating that the price will reach this higher level of liquidity.

5. Risk-Reward Consideration:
   - The trade setup suggests a favorable risk-to-reward ratio, as the entry is near a support level with the expectation of a significant price movement toward the upper liquidity area.

6. Time Frame and Context:
   - The 4-hour time frame suggests this is a medium-term trade, potentially taking a few days to play out. The context of the larger downtrend (visible on the left side of the chart) implies that the trader might be looking for a corrective move upward or a reversal after a significant downtrend.
Hello, Guysüòâ

Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive right into the main content.

-

In short, I believe Bitcoin is positioned for a price increase.

I‚Äôll explain this outlook through three key arguments,

starting with the first one.

-

‚úÖ  Reason 1.   

I‚Äôve applied the Bollinger Bands to Bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart.

Currently, the price is rebounding after touching the lower band.

Support and resistance often occur at the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands.

In this case, the price first hit the upper band, followed by a touch of the lower band‚Äîtypically a precursor to a rebound.

Let‚Äôs verify this with some historical examples.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

This is the chart from January 2024.

At that time, the price followed a similar pattern, first hitting the upper band, then touching the lower band.

Following this, the price rebounded sharply and eventually hit a new "All-time high".


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, take a look at this chart from February 2023.

Once again, the price touched the upper band, followed by the lower band, and we saw four consecutive green candles afterward, leading to a significant rally.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 3. 

This is the chart from February 2022.

Despite a prevailing downtrend, we witnessed a technical bounce after the price touched the upper band and then dropped to the lower band.

A significant rebound followed, even in the midst of bearish market conditions.

Now, let‚Äôs shift back to the current chart.

----------

‚úÖ  Reason 2. 

Next, let's take a look at the rising channel formed by three critical points.

I find this channel quite interesting.

 When focusing on the Half Line, it has consistently provided clear support and resistance levels.

Recently, we saw the price being rejected at this channel, which further reinforces its reliability.

However, the price has currently broken below the channel.

If it manages to rebound and reenter, we could witness a significant upward movement.

This pattern is commonly referred to as a "Trap," a frequent occurrence in technical analysis.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

This is the chart from December 2023.

We had a rising channel based on three key points. 

After a sharp drop, the price broke below the channel but quickly recovered, forming a "Trap" pattern before rising to the opposite end of the channel.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, take a look at the chart from March 2024.

Once again, we see a rising channel formed by three key points.

After ten consecutive green candles, the price hit a peak and dropped.

Despite breaking below the channel, the price quickly recovered, forming another "Trap" pattern and continued to rise, holding the middle line of the channel.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 3. 

Here‚Äôs a chart from November 2023.

This rising channel was formed by connecting the lower trendline and the peak.

After a price drop, the price broke below the lower trendline, forcing many retail investors to exit their positions.

However, the price soon rebounded and eventually broke out of the channel to the upside.

This time, the "Trap" pattern appeared twice, triggering multiple exits from the market.


‚úÖ  Reason 3. 

The third reason involves the  "3 Market Phases"  pattern.

This pattern typically unfolds in three distinct stages: Contraction, Expansion, and Profit Taking.

 
 First, Contraction occurs, which stabilizes the price range and makes investors feel comfortable.
 Next, the Expansion phase kicks in, causing volatility and confusion, often leading investors to get stopped out.
 Finally, the Profit Taking phase occurs, sparking a "FOMO" (fear of missing out) sentiment among investors as the price moves rapidly.
 

This pattern is often leveraged by market manipulators to shake out retail investors before a larger price movement.

Let‚Äôs take a look at some past examples to see this in action.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

Here‚Äôs the chart from January 2024.

It showcases a textbook example of the 3 Market Phases:

Contraction stabilized the price range,
Expansion created volatility and confusion,
and Profit Taking resulted in a strong uptrend.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, here‚Äôs the chart from June 2023.

Again, we see a classic case of the 3 Market Phases pattern.

During the Expansion phase, the price breached both the upper and lower bounds, forcing retail investors to stop out. This was followed by a strong directional trend.

-

‚úÖ   

 
 First reason: Bollinger Bands
 Second reason: The Channel
 Third reason: 3 Market Phases
 

-

Now, for the final conclusion of today‚Äôs post

 I am anticipating a significant upward move. 

As long as the three reasons mentioned today remain valid, I remain confident in this bullish setup.

This is a historically high-probability scenario, and  I personally plan to take a "long position." 

Thank you for reading, and if you found this analysis helpful, please consider giving it a boost and following me for future updates.

 ‚úîÔ∏è This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
‚úîÔ∏è It is a personal perspective and should be used for reference only.
‚úîÔ∏è All decisions and responsibilities lie with you.
After a long time we received a buy signal in 7-star and that too on BTC. That means there's something big cooking up, either way. 


Target 59.8 and above

Stop loss: Below our buy candle

I give a breakdown of bitcoin and sorry for the length but i do believe it is a good watch and learn analysis
I expect Bitcoin to renew the local low of 47800 and continue to fall towards 40000
Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. Not long ago, the price made impulse up to the resistance level, which coincided with the resistance zone, thereby breaking the 56700 support level. After this, the price some time tried near this level and later dropped to the 56700 level, after which it turned around and started to move up. In a short time, BTC reached the 61800 level again and even broke it, after which rose higher than the resistance zone to the trend line. Next, the price started to decline between the trend line and firstly quickly fell to the 61800 level and broke it one more time. Then price fell more, but later turned around and rose to the trend line and continued to decline near this line. At the moment, the price is trying to break this line, so, in my mind, BTCUSDT will decline below the trend line and then rebound up, breaking finally this line. For this case, I set my goal at 60500 points. If you like my analytics you may support me with your like/comment ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hello my dear friends !

As I mentioned before and we talked about BTC downtrend with you guys , Finally Bitcoin touched our target and I wanna wait for another Buy or Sell setup !
My bias for BTC has not changed from last week's forecast.

Looking at the chart I published last week as an update.

Bitcoin has made it down to $56,000. We are waiting to see a Bitcoin at 54K zone. 

Some of my community forecasted that this asset would fall to $54,000 this week. 
see the chart. #crypto
BTCUSDT 

 HELLO TRADERS  

The overall trend remains downward as long as trading stays below the turning level of 60.838 .

Currently, prices are below this level, suggesting a potential decline towards the first support level at 57.147 . If a 4-hour candle closes below this support, further declines are expected, targeting the second support level at 54.727 .

For prices to increase, the turning level must be broken and stabilized above, which could lead to a rise towards the first resistance level at 63.586 , and potentially further to 65.727 .

 KEY LEVELS : 
 
 Turning Level : 60.838 .
 Resistance Levels : 63.586 , 65.760
 Support Levels : 57.147 , 54.727
Bitcoin is in a range - wait for SL hunt and take a trade

At this moment price is inside range enviermat only traps and SL hunts is possible to take a trade here
look at chart we are in a broad bear channel , and we had a perfect test (BO point) 
and every time we fall below a low we pulls back ... so what do you think? this is third push down so its wedge bottom 
its all ready to going to moon........
now its best time to buy
Since yesterday, Bitcoin has dropped 5%, where it broke the lower support zone and resulted in a bigger break of structure on a 4-hour timeframe. 

So far everything looks good so we should see a further downward movement so let's see!

üîé Current Move From 49k Till Now Shaped As a ABC And Currently The price Playing Blow The Important Level As a Wave C PRZ, So There‚Äôs Is a Chance To See 55k And In The Worst Scenario Leg Down To The 44k

üì• I Know It‚Äôs a Unpopular Opinion But Technically It Could Happen, Totally It‚Äôs Better To Be Caution At This Area Because Any Rejection From Here Will Cause a Huge Market Crash, So If You Are In Profit It‚Äôs Better To Save Some In Here

üëâ Invalidation Of This Scenario Is Any Breakout From 66k
what do you think
Can he touch 53k again? 

I still think that it cannot go to the 70k range soon
Liquidations have cascaded after a strong sell off happened into Asia open.

The drop has intensified probably because of  Nvidia 

 NASDAQ:NVDA , posted the biggest single-day loss of market cap by any stock in history today.

Open Interest ramped up noticeably as perps are trying to lift the market on  ByBi t and  Bitfinex  after the strong selling led by  Coinbase .

Open interest has now completely reset and CVD is picking up as well.

We had a strong down move taking the previous low at 56k

Now what we want to see is for the price to find acceptance back into VAL  (value area low) 

If we can hold 56k here, I'm expecting a move toward 57.8k

And if we can flip 57k into support, an expansion to 58.6k to 59.2k is very likely.
BTCUSD fulfil my last analysis predictions by sweeping liquidity at 56k now price sweep liquidity above that FVG zone heading for new highs now am in on buys holding till new highs 
JOIN AND ENJOY 
TELL US YOUR TAKE ON THIS...................
We didn't receive a trade signal from the internal demand zones during the retracement as expected. Instead, the price action moved decisively through these zones fulfilling the target of the PO3. Now, I'm closely monitoring to see if we get a structural shift, either from the range low deviation or the old demand zone/45-minute order block. If this flip occurs, I'll be looking to enter a long position.

In Monday (start of the new week) price swept previous week low liquidity (orange line) and show willingness to go higher by breaking the 4H structure.

So the following week I would expect to see price trades higher, potentially even to opposing liquidity pool like previous week high (orange line)

Thanks you and have a nice trading week! LFG!
Traders, let's look at this traditional bearish chart setup.

1) For the past six months, there has been a bearish consolidation in the price of bitcoin.
The market appears to be in the distribution phase, 2) as seen by the decline in volume (you can observe volumes in a one-month timeframe).

I'm wishing you success and financial gain.

Hello trader's
Here is the new analysis for bitcoin for long term .
Which bullish candel it forms here ??
comment down ..
Don't forget to like and follow..
Short term analysis is also comming ..
- Macro Overview

Investors continue to withdraw bitcoin, putting pressure on exchange balances, which have dropped below 2.99 million BTC. An additional $130.2 million investment into spot bitcoin ETFs, excluding IBIT, FBTC, and BRRR due to pending results, confirmed previous figures. Investors are more optimistic about the positive momentum in Q4, supporting bitcoin prices.

- Technical Analysis

After retesting the 57,660 level, BTCUSD recovered above both EMAs and formed a higher high. This strong bullish momentum has shifted the structure upwards, accumulating strength. If BTCUSD extends its rally beyond 60,600, the price could test 61,600 before reaching 62,800. Conversely, if BTCUSD remains below 60,600, the price may retreat to 59,200 before continuing the trend.
Looking at the BTCUSDT chart, I see a strong breakout as the price has broken above the upper boundary of the falling wedge. Currently, BTC is around $60,500, and all eyes are on the new support zone at $60,000.

My plan is to wait for a slight correction to this support zone, which could be an ideal place to set up a buy order. Theoretically, if the support zone holds, the price could bounce strongly and continue towards the resistance zone of $61,148 USDT. If the price breaks this resistance level, the uptrend will be further consolidated and open the door for new highs.

Good luck to all traders!
Took previous week's high. Now it's looking to take previous day high

I anticipate price will correct down a bit more, then later on in the morning pump back up a bit then dump really hard.
If you've been in the crypto industry enough, you've seen the plateau coins. This guy (and Doge) will be the epitome of plateaus after this next spike. HODL or go home bois, this ain't no coming home party. We are going to Jupiter soon and there is no flight back, so buy crypto now or go go to Sam's club and get some bulk tissue for that hiney of your (cuz you gonna need it).
BINANCE:BTCUSDT  is showing bullish momentum after following a retracement. Currently price has broken several lower highs on 1 and 4 hr timeframe. Expecting the bullish momentum to continue!
Is it a triangle that gonna take us to higher prices?
It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve reviewed the charts, but remember, it‚Äôs always best to focus on  long-term charts  and avoid getting caught up in  short-term noise .  Leverage is gambling ‚Äîit‚Äôs like a casino and can destroy your trust in the crypto system. Stay away from it, and stick to  spot trading only  for reliable and safe growth.

Bitcoin is currently around  60,285 USDT,  holding strong. After a long break from the charts, I'm anticipating a  significant  bullish move in the  coming weeks . The price action suggests that Bitcoin could hit major resistance levels at  82,000 USDT ,  102,000 USDT , and potentially  123,000+ USDT . 

The upcoming  rate cuts and presidential elections  are likely to  impact the economy,  potentially driving a major increase in Bitcoin and crypto values. The flood of crypto news already circulating the internet reflects the growing bullish sentiment, which aligns with the expected price targets and underscores the potential for substantial upward movement.
A lot of OI added today, which makes me expect a volatile session tomorrow with FOMC around the corner.

Personally I don't care about the outcome or rate cuts, I'll just trade the chart like I always have.

We cleaned up our poor highs today, but created some new poor highs in the process. Depends a bit on the tick size you use on TPO, but I didn't see any excess or wick structure, short liquidations or OI flush, which you would like to see with such important levels taken.

With poor highs above us and poor lows below us, it's a matter of which get taken first for me.

Poor highs have confluence with CME gap above it, it would make sense to expect some kind of deviation or failed auction above, before selling off if the first move is up.

If we clean up the lows, bulls really want to hold that level; if we don't sfp but accept below, I'd expect much lower prices soon.

So again: if x then y scenario, but on steroids this time.

Please note that this is not financial advise , Please do your own research .
Yesterday, we broke the inclined line on  Bitcoin , filled the seller's zone deeper, and updated the local low.

At the moment, based on a combination of factors, we can expect a trend change from a locally ascending trend to sideways movement. The decline was accompanied by volume anomalies on the cluster chart, and now we need to position these anomalies, so we are waiting for the resolution and only then opening positions.
We are primarily looking at longs and have noted potential scenarios for the development of events on the chart.

 Buying zones:  $58,300-$56,400 (volume zone), ~$55,000 (largest horizontal volume in the last month), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies).

 Selling zones:  $59,600-$60,600 (local zone of accumulated volumes) $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes), $66,100-$68,200 (volume zone).

 Interesting altcoins. 

For the  TIA  coin, we bounced off an important volume zone, thereby confirming its strength.
On a retest of the local low of 4.48 and a false breakout of this level, we open a long.
My point of interest is a 4H bearish order-block that price printed and has recently returned to, triggering me into a sell position, i applied fibs and entered at the level which corresponded with the mean threshold of the order block mentioned

hey guys after BTC down to 57K i see hum going to 60 K after i can update  
not forget follow me to get more news
In a move that highlights its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, led by its CEO Michael Saylor, has announced a fresh $700 million debt offering to acquire more Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ). This marks the second such offering in just one month as the company aggressively expands its Bitcoin holdings. Known for its bullish stance on Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has now accumulated a staggering 244,800 BTC as part of its Treasury Reserve Asset (TRA) strategy.

The Latest Debt Offering
The newly proposed $700 million debt offering comes in the form of Convertible Senior Notes, which will be available only to qualified institutional investors. MicroStrategy plans to use the proceeds from this offering to redeem $500 million of its 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2028. After settling these debts, the remaining funds will be directed toward acquiring additional Bitcoin and other general corporate purposes.

This is not MicroStrategy's first foray into issuing convertible notes to fund its Bitcoin strategy. The company has previously conducted similar offerings, raising billions of dollars to support its growing Bitcoin portfolio. In June of this year, it made an $800 million offering, followed by a $1.1 billion Bitcoin purchase, which added 18,300 BTC to its reserves.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs Unstoppable Bitcoin Streak
MicroStrategy began its Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) acquisition spree in August 2020, becoming one of the first publicly traded companies to adopt Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) as a primary reserve asset. Over the years, the company has consistently used debt to bolster its Bitcoin reserves, reinforcing its belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

This strategy has often paid off for the company, especially in times of Bitcoin price appreciation. Most notably, MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock (MSTR) has soared as a direct result of its Bitcoin investments. After recent acquisitions, MSTR‚Äôs stock price surged by 18.74%, outpacing the broader market and gaining value even when other stocks faced volatility.

Bitcoin‚Äôs Current Market Dynamics
Despite MicroStrategy's massive Bitcoin purchase plans, the cryptocurrency itself has experienced some downward pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) is down 2% after showing strength in previous weeks. This pullback is intriguing as it comes amid positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin's recent performance and broader adoption.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48, indicating a potential for a bullish reversal. The key pivot point for Bitcoin remains at $70,000, a level that traders and analysts are closely watching. If Bitcoin can break through this resistance, it could set off another significant rally, supported by the increasing institutional interest exemplified by companies like MicroStrategy.

Institutional Impact and MSTR Stock
MicroStrategy‚Äôs continued commitment to Bitcoin reflects a growing trend of institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. With its relentless accumulation of Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ), MicroStrategy is making a bold bet on the long-term potential of the digital asset. As more institutions and corporations follow suit, Bitcoin could further cement its status as a mainstream financial asset.

For MicroStrategy, its aggressive Bitcoin strategy has not only bolstered its stock but also differentiated the company from its peers. MSTR has consistently outperformed other tech stocks, thanks in large part to its Bitcoin holdings. As the company continues to issue convertible debt and acquire more Bitcoin, investors will keep a close eye on both the price of Bitcoin and the value of MSTR stock.

Conclusion
MicroStrategy's latest $700 million debt offering underscores its confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs future. With 244,800  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  already in its reserves and plans to accumulate more, the company is betting on Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) as a core part of its corporate strategy. While Bitcoin faces near-term volatility, the long-term outlook remains promising, especially with institutional players like MicroStrategy continuing to lead the charge. If Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) can breach the $70,000 pivot, MicroStrategy‚Äôs bullish strategy could prove even more lucrative for both the company and its investors.
Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken
Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a critical zone as it struggles to hold above the $57,000 support level. The daily chart suggests that the cryptocurrency is losing momentum, with multiple technical indicators pointing towards a potential bearish breakdown.

### 1. **Price Action and Key Levels:**
   - Bitcoin is currently trading at **57,776 USDT**, down **2.29%** in the latest session. The price has ranged between **59,210 USDT** (high) and **57,493 USDT** (low), reflecting increasing selling pressure.
   - The price has failed to break through the strong resistance around **60,000 USDT**, and the downward sloping trendline indicates that sellers are controlling the market.

### 2. **EMAs Acting as Resistance:**
   - BTC is trading below all key EMAs (20/50/100/200), indicating that the bulls are losing control in both short- and long-term trends. The **20-day EMA** (58,323 USDT) is acting as immediate resistance, followed by the **50-day EMA** (59,523 USDT). The price consistently failing to reclaim these levels reflects persistent bearish sentiment.

### 3. **Descending Trendline Pressure:**
   - A clear **descending trendline** is visible on the chart, connecting recent highs. BTC has been unable to break this trendline, suggesting continued downward pressure and potential for further declines. This trendline acts as a psychological barrier for the bulls, preventing any significant breakout.

### 4. **Support Levels and Bearish Targets:**
   - The key support at **57,000 USDT** is being tested. A break below this level could lead to a sharper decline, with the next major support resting around **49,024 USDT**, which coincides with a previous consolidation zone. Traders should be cautious of a close below this support, as it could signal a prolonged bearish phase.

### 5. **RSI and Momentum:**
   - The **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** is currently at **47.34**, suggesting neutral momentum but edging closer to oversold territory. This indicates that while Bitcoin is not yet in an oversold condition, a continuation of the current trend could push the RSI below **40**, confirming further downside risk.

### 6. **Volume and Market Sentiment:**
   - The **volume** sits at **24.775K**, which is relatively low. This implies that the current move down might not yet have the momentum of a full-scale sell-off, but if selling volume picks up, it could accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs decline towards lower support levels.

---

### **Conclusion:**
Bitcoin is at a crossroads, with key support levels in danger of being breached. If the price fails to hold above **57,000 USDT**, the next target could be **49,024 USDT**. The inability to break through key EMAs and the descending trendline further signals a bearish outlook. Traders should keep an eye on volume and RSI levels to gauge the strength of the selling pressure. A breakdown could signal a prolonged bearish trend, while a bounce from these levels would provide temporary relief.
Still not yet within the optimum buy zone. A bit more downside expected. Long from 56K looks more profitable
The price is squeezed into a triangle. I expect arrival to the price level 54555. See my past ideas, to understand my working strategy
In Simple Words Technical Analysis is about study order flow the interpretation of transactions between buyers and seller's.

Based on the forecast for the BTCUSDT price over the next three months, the BTCUSDT price may remain flat for a long time. The price tried to rise, but was unable to break the resistance level of 71,831. For the exchange rate to rise further, it may need to be driven by some fundamental factors.

Brin channels and pivot points will help you predict prices in 2024. The following diagram depicts one possible scenario. If the asset price consolidates above 71,831, then it will continue to rise

Bitcoin's long-term trading plan

At present, there is no clear trend in the BTCUSDT market. The huge price increase after halving has completely lost steam. The most likely scenario is that the asset price will remain in a channel. Fundamental factors can prompt a trend reversal, as important news can greatly affect the price of a currency. Therefore, you should pay close attention to the events taking place within the cryptocurrency industry.

Consider getting into long trades before the end of next month and September. The price is expected to rise slightly.

If you have already established a long position, once the price consolidates above the 71,831 level, expect the price to rise further to 78,330.

Optimistic forecasts suggest that the price could reach 98,897.56 by the end of the year.

Prices may fall in the autumn. In the meantime, you should keep an eye on news about the cryptocurrency industry.

Long-term forecasting is challenging, even more so in current market conditions. Remember to conduct your own market research before making a trading decision.
Hey there, ‚úå 
Bitcoin is currently trading around the $58,500 range. Given the lack of stabilization above the $60,000 level, we could be facing a bearish trend. Additionally, with the recent break below the $59,300 mark, the short-term outlook on the 1-hour chart appears bearish.

We expect that after completing a pullback, the price may move towards the corrective targets of $57,500, $57,000, $56,700, and $56,000.
‚ùå Key resistance levels to watch are around $59,000 and $59,700.

üí¢ Keep in mind that this is just my personal perspective and not financial advice. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and exchange ideas!

Good luck and happy trading! ‚úåüòé

Bitcoin (BTC): $58,862.35 (-2.07%)
Bitcoin Dominance: 57.95%
Fear and Greed Index: 39 (fear) 

  WHAT HAPPENED? 

Last week, bitcoin reached the important $53,000-$50,000 buy zone (large volume anomalies), received a reaction, broke through the downward sloping line and continued to grow.

A new upward sloping line has been formed, within which we continue to trade until now. 

The sell zone of $58,700-$59,400 (mirrored volume zone) didn‚Äôt give a reaction, but, on the contrary, was broken through ‚Äî this also gave confidence to buyers. 

  WHAT WILL HAPPEN: OR NOT? 

We tested a new buy zone of $58,300-$56,400 (volume zone) and got an initial reaction. A repeat test of the buy zone and a potentially deeper test of this zone are likely. 

Locally, in order to resume a full-fledged upward movement, it‚Äôs necessary to gain a foothold above the price of ~$59,600. The sell area and the $63,000 level will serve as a benchmark for growth in the near future.

 Buy zones:  $58,300-$56,400 (volume zone), ~$55,000 (the largest horizontal volume in the last month), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies).

 Sell zones:  $63,000-$64,300 (accumulated volume zone), $66,100-$68,200 (volume zone).

 *This post is not a financial recommendation. Make decisions based on your own experience.
BTC is moving in uptrend and currently its forming harmonic pattern so we will wait for the bullish divergence and after the divergence wait for the break of the LHs to confirmation of the bullish trend to take a long trade.
üìä#BTC reaches support zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†We fell back as expected after being blocked by the periodic resistance zone, and constructed a bearish double top structure in the resistance zone. Currently, all the goals of this structure have been achieved, and the target zone overlaps with our neckline and yellow support zone. The overlapping The section is considered the heaviest support area.

‚û°Ô∏èSo we placed some new long orders in this support area. The rebound has already appeared. With the winning rate, whether we can make big profits depends on whether we can build a long structure with the same cycle here.

‚ö†Ô∏èWe have currently moved our stop loss up and are in a risk-free state, so we can expect more. If you want to participate, you need to wait until the long structure here is established before entering. The next strong support is around 55000-55800.

Last weeks high: $60,638.89 
Last weeks low: $54,371.86
Midpoint: 57,505.38

Bitcoins price action mirrored that of the week that proceeded it, with a steady climb from the start of the week, peaking on Friday close, witha weekend sell off to end the week. Looking at the chart the Midpoint needs to hold if there is a chance of continuing the rally beyond $60,000. I could see price action being nervy until the FOMC in midweek.

Last week we saw BTC go through multiple news events such as CPI, PPI in the US but also the ECB rate cut decision. The European central bank cut the interest rate from 4.25% to 3.65%, a cut of 60bps. 
This news has flown under the radar in my opinion, not many people are reporting on it could play a part in the FEDs decision on Wednesday. So far the rate cut looks to be a 25bps reduction from 5.50% to 5.25%. That leaves the US significantly higher than Europe and so in theory Europe would have the opportunity to be more risk-on than America as credit is cheaper. 
I would think that the US wouldn't like this and would seek to do something about it, that something would be a bigger cut, a 50bps cut closer to the ECB would bring the US more inline. Naturally this being the beginning of the rate cut cycle it's a marathon not a sprint and although the ECB started out strong the cuts may taper off sooner than the US, that's a whole different story but for this week this is the big focus.
Bitcoin Wallet notes that the supply of bitcoin has been declining since the first half of 2024. The rebound in the total supply of wallets is a sign that these assets could rebound.
On Friday, Bitcoin and Ethereum were hovering around key support levels.
Analysts believe the recovery in their holdings could signal a bull market for both assets.

This is a sign that Bitcoin's bull market is coming!
Therefore, my view on bitcoin is still on the rise, the rise in bitcoin over the weekend laid the foundation for next week's rise, for this situation traders should pay attention in time, do a good job in advance, everyone has a happy weekend
Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETFs are considered a marker of institutional interest in the asset.    Spot ETF inflows ended a negative streak with record net flows to the asset class on Friday, September 13.
Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance relative to other altcoins hit a new high, crossed the 57% level on Saturday.
These factors could catalyze gains in Bitcoin
The top three market movers for Bitcoin are institutional capital inflow, dominance and supply of the asset on exchanges.    These factors determine the demand for the asset, its relevance among market participants, compared to other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) and the selling pressure on BTC, eventually influencing Bitcoin price.
Data from crypto intelligence tracker Sosovalue shows that Bitcoin Spot ETFs ended the week with record inflows, $263.07 million on Friday.    This is the highest capital inflow since July 2024, in nearly 50 days.

Institutional capital inflow to Bitcoin is key since it represents demand among large wallet investors and higher inflow and demand typically fuel gains in BTC.
The fear and greed index measures the sentiment among Bitcoin traders.    The index reads neutral on Saturday, as Bitcoin makes a comeback above the psychological barrier of $60,000.

The asset‚Äôs supply on exchanges is now at its lowest point since 2018.    Declining exchange supply is considered a positive sign for the cryptocurrency since it reduces the available tokens for sale on exchange platforms and reduces selling pressure.

The asset‚Äôs dominance is the ratio of BTC market capitalization to the rest of the cryptocurrencies, namely altcoins.    Dominance has hit a new high every few days, climbs to 57.78% on September 13.

While this yields negative returns for traders holding altcoins (Bitcoin pairs), it is considered a bullish sign for Bitcoin.

CRYPTOCAP:BTC  has reversed after dropping to  GETTEX:52K  (falling channel in orange) and is now recovering on the 1D chart. On the 1W chart, there is also a sign of reversal and RSI too.

My forecast is that before taking off,  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  will strengthen within this rising channel (in blue). There's strong support at $47- GETTEX:48K , which should hold.

Based on the RSI and MACD curves, the uptrend should continue until it reaches the resistance at $67-$68k. Afterward, I anticipate a more severe correction, but the price should remain within the rising channel for some time.

The parabolic phase hasn't started yet, so I expect another drop to the bottom of the wedge before the next big move begins.

I will update this idea as it develops.

Most of my previous ideas have been accurate, so feel free to check them out and follow me for more forecasts.

My trading indicator provided a strong signal for a *short position* on the *15M timeframe. Initially, I hesitated due to the fact that we were sitting right at a key **support level*. 

However, after seeing a full-body *red candle* breaking through support, followed by a successful retest on the *lower timeframes (1M, 3M, 5M)*, I decided to enter the trade.

I‚Äôm targeting a *1:3 RR* on this setup. Let‚Äôs see how this one plays out!
My opinion about BTC is to wait and see. time heals everything This is not a gambling place, this is a sleeping place This is my personal opinion, not investment advice.
Be prepared for a sudden dump, at 61K when everyone will take long and spot for altcoins rally, there might be a sudden dump. So Keep your SL tightly coupled.

Good time, it seems that wave C is not yet complete and after a little more growth, one should expect price correction from the range of 60700-61400.
btc still continue bearish senario and, have liitle bit chance to rise again, still daily bearish OF continue to bearish side,,
In this analysis, Bitcoin has hit a key resistance level and is showing signs of rejection, as you can see. The market could be heading down temporarily.
This is abnormal
Iam expecting  Bitcoin are sharply move next 3-8 day's
From K1 to K3,
It is a bullish three soldiers advancing pattern,
But unfortunately,K3 failed to close upon the resistance.
Besides, the demands keep decreasing.
It is possible that the following candles consolidate here for days,
And then choose to break up or fall down.

On the other hand,
The supply pressure keeps at high level,
I don‚Äôt think It is easy to start another bull run immediately.

This technical study relies on weekly timeframe observations, highlighting key technical patterns and volume dynamics that suggest a bullish outlook. As of today‚Äôs date (9:26pmAST), the 24-hour long volume stands at $28.59B, underscoring significant long interest in the market. With precise data from the weekly chart, the confluence of multiple bullish indicators suggests the potential for a retest or breakout beyond the all-time high.


Analysis:
 Cup and Handle Formation : The first significant observation is the development of a classic Cup and Handle pattern, widely regarded as a bullish continuation pattern. This pattern, forming over a prolonged period, indicates a consolidation phase followed by potential upward momentum. The handle represents a minor retracement, which often precedes a breakout to the upside.

 Parallel Channel and Key Levels : Starting from the previous peak at 73,777, a parallel channel has been drawn down to the recent bottom at 52,550. This channel defines the current price action, showing a well-respected range within which the price has oscillated. The recent price action has been bouncing within the lower bounds of this channel, signaling that the market may be gearing up for a decisive move. The current trajectory suggests that if momentum continues, we could see a breakout of this channel, potentially pushing the price back toward the all-time high.

 EMA Support and Price Action : Another critical factor is the price's bounce off the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which serves as a key support level. Historically, the 50-day EMA is a strong indicator of trend direction, and the recent bounce suggests renewed buying pressure. This move reinforces the bullish outlook and could indicate a sustained push toward breaking or retesting the all-time high.

With the formation of the Cup and Handle pattern, the support from the 50-day EMA, and the market respecting the parallel channel, all signals point to a potential bullish breakout. The current long volume of $28.59B adds further confirmation of buying interest, aligning with the technical patterns that favor upside potential.
btc on critical zone, it could either breakout to ath zone or retest the previous support
Remember Today: If BTC futures break 61,766 in a week and stay above that line, we are looking at a new uptrend-sideway range between 60-80K between October - February 2024, and March 2025 if the trend has no rejection due to sentiment of the market is positive we will be looking 90-100K new range in history of BTC, should you take your position now and best of luck!
Maybe in a day we can see a heavy dump. So be prepared for that, use tight SL if you are taking long positions.

My suggestion is to avoid long right now.

Here's an idea nobody are talking about but it is one that is to be considered. If BTC were to follow these 2 trendline, i'll be wanting to accumulate in the golden ratio zone 28-30K before the real bounce up to 85K++. I hope this opportunity do come which flushes out short term investors and invites new long term investors to come in at 30K. Timeline for this might be 12-18 months since i've charted this using the monthly chart.
Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are hit
Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken.
time to update my previously idea 
The price of Bitcoin has followed path B and has been moving sideways for some time. Partly, this was due to very weak data from the U.S. labor market. A few months ago, bulls were anticipating this weakness, but now they are afraid because it has started to smell like a recession. Mr. Powell already announced on August 23 that "the time has come," and now monetary policy will be eased. There is a consensus in the market that the rate will be lowered in September, although many are expecting an immediate reduction of 50 bp. I agree with the opinion that there will be a 25 bp reduction, as a 50 bp cut would be an acknowledgment by the Federal Reserve that they erred by delaying the start of the reduction and could cause additional panic among investors. I don't think it could happen 1.5 months before the elections.

Also, additional reasons for growth are stock market buybacks in September/October and payments from FTX of about $16 billion in October.

So yes, I'm sure that the bottom has already been passed and it's only up from here
Hello People

This is what is going on with bitcoin in my eyes after a long time of not posting any ideas.

BTC on daily timeframe is in a weak downtrend kind of a bull flag but dont let the flag fool you, they could fail just like any other pattern or candle formations.

our job is to assess risk and trade in the side of higher probabilities.
At the moment on H4 time frame as you can see BTC looks like to be forming a right shoulder if you want to look at it as a H&S pattern or just simply look at it as a lower high point obviously after printing that lower low at $52500, currently hovering at %50 retracement of the bearish leg that started on Sun 25 Aug. I've highlighted a dark blue zone which is exactly between %50-%61.8 fib which is very likely to act as a strong resistance. the next bearish leg would take BTC down to 47k-46k zone, my target to get out is set at 47k mark. risk to reward wise we are in a good situation which is 3 to 1, in my opinion trading is all about good enough risk/reward ratio and trying to be on the higher probability side of the market in other words trading what you see. even the best setups can fail so be smart.

let's see how the market unfolds.
cheers
Here is the daily target to reach for BTC. I expect a possible range with a fake pump to let retails to long. Then, we will probably see a drop until the $57.200 area, where there is enough liquidity for Bitcoin. This is a magnet level, and I will DCA a short entry with an easy invalidation above $59.500
This is just a focus of the current run up set up for a trap for a potential lower low drop. Watching the range here and see what happens after the next pullback to see the next bounce entry for this falling wedge and see if we have any higher highs there after.
A study.

I'm Korean who want using TradingView in English but post "IDEA" in Korean but they're not allowing this.
I really don't know why.
There are lots of Korean sentences and words in chart but they're forcing the language when posting this Idea. 

Anyway, advice is always welcome. (if you can read word in chart.)
BTC retesting the lower part of the daily noodle.
 Possible retest/break of the 200d ma, within a daily POB.
 I think we grind up and break the next daily resistance around $61.1k., and then head to the top of the next daily FVG.
 Next target after reclaiming daily s/r would be around $64.4, within the following POB.
Got a nice BTC Bitcoin liquidity grab and go setting up. I'm already on a long so this is adding to my position.
#Bitcoin Update - Thursday, September 12, 2024 

 Good morning and peace to all brothers and sisters! 

Yesterday's daily candle for #Bitcoin closed above our key resistance line (Arrow #3), which is a very positive signal. This suggests that our breakout of the daily resistance is still valid. Now, the critical task for Bitcoin is to push above the  56,600  level to fully confirm this breakout.

 What‚Äôs Next? 
The key level to watch today is  56,600 . If today‚Äôs candle closes above this level, our bullish momentum will continue. However, if the price stays between  57,000  and  56,600 , we‚Äôll remain in a consolidation phase or range.

It's important to note that we still have daily resistance (Arrow #2) and a weekly trendline at  60,633  to break for further upside movement. 

On the flip side, if the price breaks any of our key support lines‚Äîeither the black or blue line‚Äîit will be the first bearish signal to watch out for.

 Alts Update 
Altcoins are performing well alongside Bitcoin, and all our buy trades are currently in profit, Alhamdulillah. I will continue to update my buy trade list. To stay updated on my latest trades, make sure to follow along.

Wishing you all a very successful and profitable day ahead!
Can see Some Bulls Probably gonna grab Quick buy here 
Lets see what happens 

Good Luck
Hi guys 
I can see some Sellers come into market  , There will probably some sells come in 
Yeah looks bearish quick in and out
FA: The majority of crypto market participants are currently in a depressed mood regarding the medium-term future of the crypto market as a whole. Such behavior of the crowd says first of all that weak hands are not ready to buy now, and the sawtooth movement, which started since March and has lasted for more than 6 months, puts even experienced participants in a stupor, forcing them to close speculative positions, dump risky assets and expect a further decline comparable to the collapse in the spring of 2020.

However, a deeper look reveals several significant trends:

A drop in the influx of new bitcoins to exchanges.
Since the beginning of the year, the number of new coins entering exchanges has been declining. This indicates that professional investors prefer to keep their assets in their wallets, which means they are not preparing to sell. This factor is traditionally considered to be a bullish sign, as a decrease in supply on exchanges may contribute to price growth in case of renewed buying activity.

Increased outflow of bitcoins from exchanges.
This sign is also positive and confirms the narrative of asset accumulation by smart capital. It can be seen especially well at the moment of price drawdown: during and after aggressive shakeouts, a surge in coin outflows is clearly visible. 

Despite the globally passive sentiment, the fundamentals of exchange inflow/outflow suggest that strong hands continue to accumulate while the crowd is perplexed by what is happening.

Reduced supply on the exchanges and increased demand from large holdings are creating all the conditions for future price gains, our idea is that the market has been in a reaccumulative phase for the past six months.

From a  technical analysis standpoint , I anticipate a continued downside for BTC. Two potential scenarios may unfold:

1 - Retest of the 4-hour Order Block (OB): BTC could test the 52,000-54,000 range, followed by a gradual reversal, suggesting a more measured recovery.

2 - Retest of the Weekly Fair Value Gap (FVG): Alternatively, BTC may drop to the 47,300-44,000 zone, which could trigger a sharp "V-shaped" reversal with aggressive momentum driving the price higher, potentially towards new all-time highs (ATH).


In either case, monitoring key support and resistance levels within these zones will be critical.
BTC is currently stuck in this price range. It can turn bullish if it breaks the structure.
red lines  - sell or watch zone for bull trend continuation
 orange lines  - touch already
 green lines  - accumulation zone (with DCA)

 BULLRUN  confirmation after 69000 retest (at least on small tf).
 BEARMARKET?  we don`t talk things like this here :)

But personally i think that we have around 40% chance for a new low under 47000.

Altcoins? other story...NOV or next year
it is set to sweeping the trend line liquidity to the resistance level at 61447 right after which we will return to bear market continuation which if the current LL fail to hold 40k will be the next target
Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken
Take noted the below is not an investment advise, bet at your own risk. I am solely not responsible for any of your loses in money or assets.

The Current Bitcoin price is USDT26221.12 as of 26 September 2023.

The Bitcoin have potential to drop to USDT24292.54 range in the coming 1.5 months before the Fed's FOMC in November 2023.

The price will hover between USDT24292.54 to about USDT29240.33 within this period.

Potential strong tailwind is the pause of US Fed's rate hike this coming November 2023. This will drive and test the resistance level at USDT29240.33. If there is a breakout then the next level of stronger resistance based on the dynamic resistance will be at USDT31334.78. If there is a breakout at USD31K plus then the next power strong 1 week resistance at USDT63665.58

Potential strong headwind will drive the market to around USDT24292.54 because of higher rate for longer by Fed's US. If next 1.5 months down the road if there is other or fews strong headwinds appears then the price might breakout from USDT24292.54 and head lower to a super stronger support of 1 month chart at USDT14576.47. This is highly unlikely to happen withing next few months as the Fed's is data dependent and also depend of the next 6 months' data to say that they will maintain the Fed's funds rate for longer. Still I think is not clear at the moment that the Fed's need higher for longer for 2 years.

USDT14576.47 is a very strong support level based on the 1-month chart of Bitcoin. I would only start buying a little at USDT24292.54 and reassess for 2 to 3 weeks before buying more. If by the time Bitcoin reach USDT24292.54 and the S&P most likely have no reach 3900. The Bitcoin might go lower following the S&P 500 going to 3900.

Based on current market condition it is highly unlikely to get a low that surpasses last year October 2022 bottom. However, the future for a US recession is unclear currently as there is both camp of soft landing and a recession.
so at this point price can go either ways since there's a bullish flag and a bearish trend at the same time...so lets be cautious about our trades
In this idea, we are considering a stop-hunt to the  GETTEX:59K  region due to the CPI data coming out differently than expected. At 14:30 CEST to 16:00 you can expect a lot of volatility during this time. Liquidation charts show a cluster of about $1.2b at around $58.7k.
#BTC #Bitcoin #Update #Setup 15 #Eddy


I don't know the main reason why I changed my mind from a sharp market fall, but at least I know that I used to take Bitcoin from the $25,000 range to very large targets, but it makes sense to introduce this setup to you. On the monthly time frame Bitcoin has closed above the previous ceiling with the body of the candle and on the other hand we have a valid exchange range that can support Bitcoin and cannot be ignored, but the market maker always surprised us. If I were to act like a sniper, the setup I have considered is suitable for the stated objectives, but I have marked the important support areas for you anyway, including the weekly block order I specified with WOB and finally If the monthly block order area I specified with Mob is gone. , we can see the drop until we reach the target of our previous 14 setup. & Do not forget that the WOB area should not be neglected.

Perfect execution on yesterday's setup. Today's plan is very simple. I expect to see BTC above $57.000 today. It's still early to see if now is the perfect time to entry for a long, but doesn't matter. I start now to build a long entry and I will DCA targeting $57.000. As of now, we have liquidity at that level
As early as march 17, we could have confirmed the bull run and bagged some alt coins for generational wealth
BTC is still within the range of bearish sideways, Its a region of over bought. It may fall down as it looks like a fake breakout or a bull trap, coins will bleed with too much speed and they are gonna eat the longs...Next support might be apprx $51500, Keep your SL tight. Good Luck.
Bitcoin Update: Tuesday, 10th September 2024

Good evening to all my brothers and sisters. 

Yesterday, Bitcoin made a significant jump, as I had predicted in my analysis. On the 4-hour chart, it broke through all key support and resistance levels, placing the price firmly in a bullish zone. However, on the daily time frame, the price remains under the first resistance (marked by Arrow #3).

 What‚Äôs Next?
If the price manages to hold above or moves further up from this daily resistance, we could see a potential jump to near the $59,000 level. However, if the price breaks below the blue lines, this would indicate that the recent upward movement was merely a retracement rather than a trend reversal. In that case, we could expect a significant drop.

But even in the event of a decline, there are still two major support levels that remain valid (marked by Arrow #5 and Arrow #6). These are key pivot points on both the daily and weekly time frames, so they‚Äôll be critical to watch.

 Altcoins Performance
Altcoins have also started moving positively following Bitcoin‚Äôs jump yesterday. I‚Äôve already shared several signals on my channels, and I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for more opportunities. Once we see confirmation of Bitcoin breaking the black line, I‚Äôll be looking to add more coins to our watchlist.

Make sure you have your notifications turned on and stay tuned for more updates. 

Wishing you all a great day ahead!
Price of BTC will decrees to 53830!

If we breakdown this level, and retest it ----> short until major trendline (could hit lower after rate cut if 50 bps)
The price is moving within a downward-sloping channel, indicating a bearish trend. 
The upper boundary of the channel is acting as resistance, while the lower boundary is acting as support.
The price recently bounced off the lower boundary of the channel, suggesting a temporary relief or reversal within the channel.                    
Bitcoin is currently testing the upper boundary of its descending channel
Self-Explantory. Very short-term trade. BTC *may* have found its bottom for the time being, thus this could be a counter-main-trend trade. Good risk/reward though, and previous range (current little bounce from top) is taking some of the steam away from the move up, so once it gets to the indicated range the trade will be safer.
BTc at trendline resistance. Dont open new long spot positions here. Wait for breakout. Otherwise it will go down.
üöÄ Hey Traders! üöÄ

Hello,

The trend is currently ranging between 70022.00 and 52741.67, so some additional patience will be required for this market.

We have a major resistance level at 67826.31, which is keeping the price trending bearish below 60336.81. We might see a minor bullish pulse followed by a drop to a lower low at Elliott Wave 4, or the bullish pulse could be significant enough to reach previous highs. This condition indicates a ranging market.

If the market drops to the Elliott Wave 4 low, it will still be uncertain whether that low will hold as support or break. For now, only if the price goes above 71773.89 and forms a strong higher low will there be potential for a market shift to bullish. Until that happens, this remains a bear market.

The current market structure is H-L-(H)-LH, and the LL is in question because a HH did not properly form for "(H),"  making 72525.81 the argument of the current price due to pin rejection.

 Overall conclusion : The market is currently in a state of uncertainty, oscillating within defined ranges. Watch for key support and resistance levels and potential shifts in market structure and such key levels at 60336.81 and 71773.89. Any significant movement above these figures could indicate a potential shift in market dynamics, - but until then, the bearish sentiment is likely to persist.

Happy Trading,

Hello trader's
Here is your bitcoin next move update so 
carefully watch this level for of my box breakout
either it go up or break it down...
so be ready and miss to follow for updates...
BTCUSDT is trending downward toward the lower end of its consolidation zone. The market has been fluctuating between 52K and 72K since April. Now, it looks poised to retest the bottom of this range, especially after breaking and closing below the key psychological level at 60K. On the weekly timeframe, the price also broke and closed below the prior week's low, forming a significant bearish candle. This suggests that bearish momentum may continue. The target is the support level at 54,000
We could see a rapid rally on Monday that will last until Wednesday when the CPI data is released. We are currently in a mean reversion as show with the arrow. We broke through the ema50 and are retesting it right now. The order books are also pointing to $56k as there is a lot of liquidity in the form of orders looking to be filled.
Cup and Handle Pattern: 

The Cup: The chart shows a rounded bottom formation that resembles a cup, often indicative of a longer consolidation period before a breakout.

The Handle: After the cup formation, the price appears to be forming a handle, which is a short-term downtrend before the breakout. The handle often slopes downwards slightly, and once the price breaks out of the handle's resistance line, a significant move upwards can follow.

 Key Resistance Level: 
The resistance seems to be around the $65,000 - $70,000 level. A breakout above this area would likely indicate a continuation of the previous bullish trend.

 Volume Analysis: 
The chart shows increasing volume during the cup formation, which is a healthy sign for the bullish pattern. However, it looks like volume has decreased slightly in the handle phase, which is normal for this pattern. An increase in volume during a breakout from the handle would confirm the strength of the upward move.

 RSI (Relative Strength Index): 
The RSI is currently at 57.21, which is neutral. It indicates there is still room for upward movement before entering overbought territory (above 70). This supports the bullish view if the price breaks out.

 Stochastic Oscillator: 
The Stochastic indicator shows a value of 61.68 (blue), which is also relatively neutral but trending upward. If the stochastic continues its upward movement, it may suggest a potential entry point for buyers before hitting overbought conditions.

 VM Candle Divergences: 

The chart uses a custom indicator (VMC Cipher Divergences), which might show some bullish divergence, but it requires confirmation through volume and momentum changes.
Prognosis:
If the handle breakout occurs above the resistance line (~$65,000), the next bullish target would be near previous all-time highs, around $75,000 or higher.
A failure to break the handle's resistance could lead to a short-term pullback to test lower support levels around $50,000.

 Market Outlook: 

Bullish Case: A successful breakout would lead to a continuation of the uptrend, and the price could target $75,000 - $80,000 in the next phase.

Bearish Case: Failure to break resistance at around $65,000 may lead to a correction back to $50,000 - $45,000, where stronger support lies.

This analysis leans toward a bullish outlook, as the technical pattern suggests a breakout might be imminent. However, monitoring volume and momentum indicators will be key for confirming the next move.
The market was respecting the trend line again and again...Just made an analysis out.

still holding my short see BTC 48K target whit 1HTF bearish flag printing  BINANCE:BTCUSDT.P
Greetings,

Among crypto traders, there is always a saying called "Uptober". You might be wondering, is it a bit too early to buy Bitcoin considering it's still early in the September? Well, check the institutional buying pressure from 50K to 53K, it's pretty unlikely Bitcoin will dip bellow 52K. While the macro economy embracing a soft landing, Bitcoin is destined to outperform S&P 500. In other words, money will  pull out from the stock market and flow into bonds and crypto.  

The strategy is simple, Buy bitcoin now and sell around the end of November. The probability to take profit around Nov 28th is very attractive.

Happy trading!
analysis
- price is still relatively "high" at +50k range but consolidation is prolonged hence all STF technical are all ready under water turning bearish

- only weekly now at the touch for EMA, which can be a support for a bounce i.e it either bounce here for relieve, otherwise if broken, that's one of the worst scenario. so decision point is near, with liquidity problem, hand on there (currently similar to HTF of 2021)

- however, on LTF,  price is weak under water. silver lining is Daily time frame is testing support with higher low (reminder low was 49k, a test around low under 55k is understandably expected)

strategy is

- hold on to position based on weekly time frame
- watch out for daily, do I want to scalp around ETH (ETH is very very weak under consideration that ETH is live), SOL turn out to be much better alternative with price holding +$125, whereas ETH is already 30% down from $3300 to $2300. A scalp from ETH to SOL at range low is prudent or not ?
- blessing in disguise with own fund. let's just wait. think from another perpspective of already secured land/deal. take the time
- if price crash, which break low 49k, then need serious reconsideration of both trading/investment plan and use of fund plan (but it may take time because price is still around $55k and mkt is slow)
The "Market Direction" indicator combines four advanced sub-indicators to provide a comprehensive and multi-dimensional analysis of market trends, momentum, and potential reversals. This innovative approach leverages different aspects of price action, volume, and market sentiment, offering traders an in-depth view of market conditions.

 1. Fractal Indicator: Multi-Scale Price Action Analysis 
The Fractal Indicator identifies significant highs and lows over six different pivot lengths, offering a nuanced view of price action across multiple timeframes. By comparing distances from current closing prices to these key fractal points, the indicator determines potential trend reversals and market direction. This approach enables traders to adapt their strategies to various market conditions, capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

 2. Volume MACD Indicator: Enhanced Market Momentum 
The Volume MACD Indicator goes beyond traditional MACD analysis by incorporating volume-weighted movement and the structural attributes of candlesticks (such as body length and wicks). This hybrid model offers a more comprehensive understanding of market momentum by integrating both price action and trading volume. The use of Smoothed Moving Averages (SMMA) reduces noise and ensures more stable signals, helping traders focus on sustainable trends and longer-term investment opportunities.

 3. Cumulative Volume Momentum Indicator: Volume Dynamics Insight 
The Cumulative Volume Momentum Indicator evaluates the momentum of cumulative buying and selling volumes, offering a clear picture of market strength and potential reversals. By comparing the relationship between open, close, high, and low prices, and applying a MACD approach to these volume dynamics, this indicator helps traders identify momentum shifts that often precede price movements. The visualization through histograms adds clarity to bullish and bearish volume momentum, enhancing decision-making in volatile markets.

 4. POC-Price Momentum Indicator: Market Depth and Sentiment 
The POC-Price Momentum Indicator assesses the difference between the Point of Control (POC) and closing prices, providing insights into underlying market sentiment. Positive differences indicate a buildup of upward momentum, while negative differences suggest a bearish tilt. By calculating moving averages of these differences, the indicator highlights the strength and sustainability of ongoing trends, helping traders align their strategies with the broader market direction.

 Unified Rating for Confirming Market Direction 
The "Market Direction" indicator consolidates the outputs of these four sub-indicators into a single, aggregated sentiment score. This score helps traders confirm the prevailing market trend by weighing the combined insights from fractal analysis, volume momentum, price action, and POC dynamics. A positive score suggests a bullish market, while a negative score indicates bearish conditions.
Main Concept 
 
 The core idea behind the Super Trend Reversals indicator is to assess the momentum of automated trading bots (often referred to as 'Supertrend bots') that enter the market during critical turning points. Specifically, the indicator is tuned to identify when the market is nearing bottoms or peaks, but just before it shifts direction based on the triggered Supertrend signals. This approach helps traders engage with the market right as the reversal momentum builds up, allowing for entry just as conditions become favorable and exit before momentum wanes.
 
 How It Works 
 
 The Super Trend Reversals uses multiple Supertrend calculations, each with different period and multiplier settings, to form a comprehensive view of the trend. The total trend score from these calculations is then analyzed using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to gauge the strength and sustainability of the trend.
 A key feature of this indicator is the isCurrentRangeSmaller() function, which evaluates if the current price range is lower than the average over the recent period. This function is critical as it helps determine the stability of the market environment, reducing the likelihood of entering or exiting trades based on erratic price movements that could lead to false signals.
There is short opportunity for BTC Next Few Hours , But Could bounce up a bit first . 

Best of luck 


Please note that this is not trading advice . This just my own Trading Idea to 
Share ..
In less than six months, you will see Bitcoin at $38,000 and $35,000, and you will see $70,000 in two years.
You are already seeing this
its about to create a new low , keep shorting until the chart shows something different
pivot point is at 66370.

preference

The downside prevails as long as 66370 is resistance.

Alternative scenario

The upside breakout of 66370, would call for 74760 and 79760.

Comment

The RSI is below 50. The MACD is below its signal line and negative. The configuration is negative. Moreover, the price is trading under both its 20 and 50 period moving average (respectively at 60056 and 61883).

Bitcoin has the high volume break thats why are expecting short toward the down side ,but barrier of 52k is also very crucial it can be big long after small short
BINANCE:BTCUSDT.P  Holding on to my short entry was 64390 still believe we will visit 45K levels
BINANCE:BTCUSDT.P  Holding on to my short entry was 64390 still believe we will visit 45K levels
BTC in green support zone.

Not interested in a long here on this double bottom there is no volume to support it on the 2hr and the daily is showing signs that volume is consistent for further down moves.

Only entertaining a long position if it traps off that next low, honestly isn't a great low since that was a panic move from the Japan blow out so I'm dubious if there will be much reaction there and price action suggest it just caught a lot of people off guard.  Only a V shaped reversal for now.

For a short continuation price has to break that low and find some price acceptance and some sort of channel to form, be looking for a pull back to trap off one of the lower highs made.

Using candle close above 21EMA on daily or 2hr setup of a similar nature.  V shaped with a solid 2hr close candle across the EMA with an increase in volume.  No volume, then no entry.
Bitcoin constitutes the three bottoms model, which may drive prices to visit 63,000 thousand dollar , then start for new summits
Btc correction in weekly  and ready for heavy Pump üöÄüöÄ
Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken
CRYPTOCAP:BTC  ,The prediction of August 31 happened, it seems that we should wait for the price explosion of Bitcoin.#demand pressure
Im looking today for a short term trade.
My expectation is that we will retest the point that brought us to the bottom. I leave it to the market to determine what the price will do.
This is the predicted pathway for Bitcoin:

52,200->66212->55269->75749->70369->89749.
This will complete a 5 wave structure. I will reveal the next set of pathways after this is done.

Swing Pathways
Eiseprod
A blue horizontal line represents a possible resistance or support level.
A greenish-blue zone at the bottom indicates a potential strong support area around the $52,500 level.
An arrow pointing upward suggests a potential recovery after hitting the support zone
Probably Bitcoin price didn't completed downtrend yet. There's diamond and cup formations for that possibility. 

 Diamond Formation 

The price forming a diamond view since the last $70K times and you can see that by looking at purple lines.

Diamond formation works as bearish formation if the price already in uptrend process. But diamond formation also works as bullish if the price already in downtrend process. Bitcoin was rising since early 2023. So i think that formation will work as bearish and will push the price down this time.

Formation's mid line shows $58.6K. So if the price can hold that level it can gain more momentum towards to upside. Otherwise mid term target of the formation is $34K -  GETTEX:36K  range.

 Cup Formation 

There's also cup formation probability. If diamond structure works as bearish price will want to touch to cup formation's line at the bottom. It's diamond formation's target at the same time. (Red box below)
3 Bullish indicators for BTC 

 
 Bullish Cyper: All the retraces are valid for this pattern. The .786 retrace from X-D is perfectly aligned with an important support from history that was created in 2021. The X-B retrace is 100% clearly present there and the A-C retrace is almost just there.
 Classic Bullish Divergence: Higher lows on the MACD and RSI oscillators and lower lows on the price validates this pattern. This perfectly aligns with the pivot of the Bullish Cypher and the historical support line. 
 Overall Context of the Structure: the context of the structure is reasonable. These pattern usually appear after a correction and it seems to be the case for BTC right now. It is also easy to set a stop loss because of that support line and everything under. If BTC falls below that support line, expecting further downside.
BTC stroked ATH by march and is on a downtrend for finding a support to fly high ....My small chart could help ...

Hello again!
Based on D1 chart, we see strong downtrend to the BTC and also based on the news whales are still going to sell their asset. Will this continue to break the level of  based from previous market structure support? Let's wait and see. 

I'm setting the trend advanced if the trend continues to go down to the next previous level of structure as it respect the flow.
BTC ended up in a complex WXY correction. Initially what may have seemed like a FLAT ended up being WXY. No matter how much the MM  plays with the market and no matter what news hits the screen, algos always run their course guys. 

We are in the early formation of wave 3, which will make history. True we may retrace a bit more to tap the lower levels but this will sling shot BTC to the ATH ! Remember the deeper the retracement of wave 2, the higher will be wave 3, a slingshot - - get it ;). Mega hidden bullish divergence on the weekly also playing out well. 

Invalidation of this idea is at the low of Wave Y. WorD of advice guys, avoid over leverage and practice risk management fells. DCA is the name of the game. When Bitcoin hits ATH, all ALTS will pop like fireworks hence DCA and Spot Buy is the name of the game, especially for all the young bucks and inspiring traders out there.

Disclaimer: Not financial advice.
BTC has tested the HTF demand zone and found support on $52500 expected to bounce off of that to $66,000 Its time to buy.

Follow me for more accurate setups.
Hi Dears. 
 Bitcoin can fill last fvgs which made with news movement 
 for this We can go long up to 2% in BTc Today 


@TradeWithMky
As you can see in the chart,
There are 3 Strong Support lines under the price, the weekly channels bottom line + MA50 at (53500$), Long term monthly trend line at ( 51500$ apx.) and the main support at 38500$ the 100&200 moving averages.
what i see , the chart is dropping down the cowards and then we could observe the main bullish trend .
as i mentioned before due to weekly cup pattern we can predict to reach 115k$ or pessimistically at least 95k$ for this autumn. 


REMEMBER ALWAYS, TIME IS YOUR FRIEND.
Wait for the good fundamental news mid of September.

Hello, I'm Whale_signal

Before that, we'll review the 1H-BTCUSDT chart

The problematic spot was an hour stick, showing a flow of settling the orange whale surface, and then a sharp drop came out immediately

There are probably people who hosted LONG on that spot

1. If you have made a buy on Whale Indicators, you should designate an entry price cut right away
-> Whale indicators are strong indicators, so if they break, which direction? We don't know how much the price will be pushed
-> Profit is important, but risk response comes first

2. There's been a $250 rise from the orange whale indicator and $250 in the futures market is definitely not a small profit
-> Even if you didn't eat $250, you could have avoided a big loss if you designated it as a stopper

I don't feel good because there might be people who lost money. From now on, please make sure to proceed with the stoppage


1H - BTCUSDT Update


It's a very complicated seat. I think it'll help, so I've added a white whale indicator

If it fails to rise above the orange whale index, it could continue to face downward pressure, and if it deviates below, it could see mid to late 46K to late 47K

And if the mid to late 46K to 47K are also breached, please refer to the 1D-BTCUSDT purple whale indicator

You have to be careful because it's continuously being pushed down and it's located under the purple whale indicator

The chart shows that BTC/USDT is trading within a descending wedge pattern, with price action consistently testing the lower boundary of this pattern.
The price is currently sitting at a crucial support level of around $52,408, represented by the green trendline and the horizontal yellow line, which has served as a historical support area.
Support and Resistance Levels:

 Immediate support is around $52,408. A break below this level could lead to a retest of lower support near the $50,000 psychological level or potentially lower.

The nearest resistance is the upper boundary of the descending wedge, followed by horizontal resistance around $66,000.
Possible Scenario:

 A strong bounce off the current support level around $52,408, followed by a breakout above the upper boundary of the descending wedge, could signal a bullish reversal. A breakout above $66,000 would confirm a strong uptrend continuation.

 If BTC fails to hold the support at $52,408, we could see increasing selling pressure, pushing the price down towards the next support level.

A head and shoulders pattern formation was completed earlier, indicating a bearish signal that appeared in the downward movement.

Currently, the descending wedge pattern is typically a bullish reversal pattern; thus, a breakout to the upside would align with the usual outcome of this pattern.

Monitoring volume is essential; a breakout with a strong volume would validate the move.

Oscillators such as the RSI and MACD would provide further confirmation; look for an oversold signal on the RSI or a bullish crossover on the MACD.

Manage risk with stop-loss levels below current support if bullish, or slightly above the upper boundary of the wedge if a continued bearish move is expected.
This analysis suggests that BTC is at a pivotal point, with significant upside potential depending on the integrity of the support level. Keep an eye on volume and price action near key levels for cues to the next major direction.

Is it just me, or does anyone else feel a little nauseous and like being in a long might be a really really bad idea looking at this M on BTC ... sheesh
First on downtrend 51600 is target based on ichimoku and fibonacci strategy
Then maybe touching the 200 ema on weekly
Next target on 68526
Our first rule is that everything is possible in this market. Therefore, we should not act emotionally and stick to a single thought.

Fed decisions are now very critical.
If Bitcoin rises above 70,000, this scenario will be cancelled.
I hope Fed will make the market happy.

Trump has definitely expressed support for crypto, while Harris claims to support it as well, but there are reports that her party's policies do not mention crypto at all.

Although there are news reports that a crypto association has funded Harris's campaign, it seems that the expectations have completely diminished.

From a technical analysis perspective, the yellow leading line at the bottom of the daily chart indicates a price decline, so I believe we are definitely not in a rebound phase yet.

Looking at the multi-chart, there may be a brief rise, but I think it will be movements within the range of the daily chart that serves as the baseline.

I will add comments when the yellow leading line on the daily chart turns from rising to falling.




Current Bitcoin analysis with multi-chart. 

On the 1-hour chart, the yellow line is trying to turn downward, but on the 1-day chart, the yellow line is steadily showing an upward trend.
I dont trade this but i might start to, I marked tis out a while ago...... just checked it.
it moved SOME. needs to go lower
If price can hold the green support/ 0.618 Fib retracement / 1.618 Fib extension

there is a chance for an next impulse in either 

wave C (wave 4 not complete)
or an wave 3 (wave 4 complete)

if the next impulse reaches the 1.236 fib extension the highs will be in reach 
a large candle or short squeeze above the highs will indicate it will be an wave 3 intermediate and wave 5 primary has already started

for the long term count wave 5 could be extended like in the 2017 bullrun
look for my older post for the extended wave 5 possibility for more details
Nous allons tester le support pour mieux repartir pour le reste du mois et pr√©parer octobre comme il se doit ! Bon courage pour l'√©tat d'esprit et ne l√¢chez rien.
hi every one i guess btc will fil its big wick around 49k. so i will setup long position.
entry : 50500
stop : 48900
target area:  at least 62-63k
53, 6 looked like a potential target and they are atleast heading that way right now. They had move price up a few times and brought it down, with the market extended anyways I felt that down could be very possible and it was. I do anticipate a strong move up after this correction. I see this as a retrace to go higher. Cheers!
CRYPTOCAP:BTC  1D chart;

Let's do a general #Bitcoin analysis;

Bitcoin hasn't had a daily EMA (50-200) crossover in a little over 11 months. However, if it continues like this, it will experience a Dead Cross cross in a few days. This can also be interpreted as a bearish signal. This intersection does not mean that it will fall 100%, but it is one of the strong signals.

Bitcoin continues its downtrend after its historic peak, making continuous lower highs.

I would like to draw your attention to the MSS levels; they signal a trend reversal. The last upward trend reversal happened and it hasn't changed to the downside yet. For this to happen, a close below the +OB level of $56000 is required. Then the downside MSS will take place. Following this closely will give you an idea of the possible trend direction.

It last tested the $49000 level with a hard pin. This is the OB resistance. We see that this area is working well.

I still think that the $48000 level, which I have mentioned every time (unless there is no contrary data), can be retested.

However, if there is a close below it, the OB at $42000 and the BPR (Balance Price Range) at $41000, just below it, could be tested.

These are not possibilities that I expect, I just want to let you know that these levels exist. In a possible dire scenario, these levels can be targeted to determine entry points.

A slow Thursday and potential leverage in the chart. Non-farm and other news is up today. Price is moving a bit slow and I don't have a a confident idea on the direction. A guess would be a fake move up to take shorts and inspire longs then back into my green zone for the lower projected areas. Dow has been rising consistently and a retrace would be understandable and DXY has been falling and is due for a bounce which could mean down for BTC but in this climate it may very well mean up for an extended false move up for a later correction probably early in the weekend while the banks are closed. Well thats it for now, hopefully a direction is revealed soon...

As I have been mentioning that we are in a big reaccumulating phase for the bears.
I look at charts that has similar pattern playing out and what I see is when we have the covid crash in 2020 before making new all time high. I am using that but reversed for the bears.

Based on the chart, we will expect to see one last pump to liquidate the shorts before making the biggest leg down. target price for the pump can varies from 68000-72000 - liquidate area.

You would see a very sharp pump and it will be in the overbought area, once we reached the overbought area in the rsi and macd, and momentum shifts, that is your sign to get out as we will be coming back down for the finish the reaccumulating pattern to create the bear market past 49000.
A drop from the 50 after a few 15 minute candles didn't really do much would have been a good entry. About a 1.8% drop. I was correct about this 57,200. I had finally had a chance to review some higher time frames and that proved effective. MM can go either way here but dont be surprised if the lower green areas are taken as there may be high liquidity there...
In the weekly chart, the XRP price action reveals a triangle pattern formation. With a solid support trendline, the recent bull cycle within the pattern challenges the overhead trendline. 

Currently, it is taking support at the confluence of the 50-week and 200-week EMA in a sideways trend in a bullish alignment. Furthermore, the XRP price struggles to surpass the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.5993 in the weekly chart. 

Facing multiple higher price rejections, the weekly closing above this level is yet to be achieved. Last week, the XRP price dropped 8.76% and is currently trading at $0.5542 with a weekly return of 1.19%. 

In the recent turn of events, the attorney Fred Rispolli has downplayed the recent concerns of the SEC appealing the XRP ruling. As per his point of view, the ruling is unlikely until 2026, which will have little to no impact on the XRP price. 

Hence, the upcoming XRP prices will likely be independent and not depend on the ongoing lawsuit. Meanwhile, Ripple has requested a stay order on the $125 million penalty announced in the recent events.

Further, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has announced the upcoming release of Ripple USD stablecoin and the active efforts to boost the XRPL ecosystem with smart contract capabilities in the Ripple blockchain. 

Despite the recent key developments, the XRP price has not found any positive impact and continues to follow a sideways trend after the bearish impact. 

The ongoing bear market remains a key reason behind the need for the bullish impact of such major developments. Hence, with a broader market recovery anticipated by late 2024, the bull run in XRP will likely surpass the 23.60% level. 

Based on the Fibonacci levels, the price targets 2026 stand at $1.29 and $1.56.

Following the inside bar that formed when price broke below 14 day EMA looks like price will fall till around 51K. If this doesn't hold can be meltdown till 40K for BTC .
BTC is at a critical support level right now. If it fails to hold, we could see a drop toward $55k, and potentially further down to $53k. Manage your positions carefully, as a breakdown could lead to significant downside movement.
In the vast, unpredictable galaxy of trading, avoiding bad setups is like having a good shield generator. It won't make you invincible, but it'll save you from a lot of unnecessary damage. Remember, every trade you don't take because it doesn't meet your criteria is a potential disaster avoided. So, keep your trading cool, your patience high, and your greed in check. After all, in the words of a wise space traveler, "Don't Panic!" - but do plan, wait, and strike when the stars align in your favor.

The past few week has been a slow bleed for majority of Altcoins and that's majorly due to the slow trend of BTC. 

BTC has developed a channel range over the past 15 weeks which has now developed into a visible pattern. 
The biggest narrative for me now is patience cause there's been a load of "what if" questions. 
It's important to note that the 45k - 48k region is pivotal to the continuation of the Up trend.

On my chart, i've been able to clearly identify the range lows, high and mid range respectively as this could be very useful in the coming weeks. 

With this said, i'd be patient to see how the market responds this regions.

Stay safe, Traders

Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken
BTC is in a tight consolidation range, and the next move could be decisive in the very short term. Keep an eye on key support and resistance levels and watch for volume spikes to confirm the breakout direction. As always, manage risk with appropriate stop-loss levels.

This is a quick update for immediate trading decisions, so be sure to monitor closely for any rapid changes in price action.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.
Bitcoin will go to 80 thousand if it breaks the falling wedge I will update monthly and put my opinion here 
Thx y all mr E
Bitcoin remains at support, testing this level precisely today. Yesterday‚Äôs candle dipped below support with a long wick but closed above it, forming a potentially bullish candle. However, this type of candle needs confirmation, which would mean another bullish candle today. At the moment, we don't have that.

Once again, Bitcoin is sitting at support, and the bullish divergence on multiple time frames is still valid. For now, nothing has changed since yesterday, but we want to see some buying action today.

More importantly, this only matters if you are trading daily. For those dollar-cost averaging or holding long-term positions, this short-term analysis shouldn‚Äôt matter. I assume this applies to 99.9% of you.
# Bitcoin Update on Thursday, 05.09.2024

Assalamu Alaikum and good morning to all brothers and sisters!

# Bitcoin continues to drop, as I mentioned in yesterday's analysis. In this chart, I have drawn the exact reversal points by price (see arrows #6, #5, #4). Once again, the price is typically in a downtrend/range. However, a catalyst can reverse the trend. Otherwise, the price may continue in the same direction.

# ALTS
# Altcoins are dropping as usual, more than Bitcoin. At the moment, there are no buy trades. We can look for sell trades later. I will share some sell trades in the group later, Insha'Allah.

I wish you all a very nice day.

I think it'd be great if you get support from the orange whale index and go with the purple whale index
I hope there's no deviation from this section

Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken
Yesterday for  Bitcoin , we saw a bounce from $56,000 and tested the selling zone of $58,000-$59,400 (mirrored volume zone), from which we expected a selling reaction.
At the moment, we have returned to the local buying zone of $56,700-$56,000, from which a repeated buyer reaction and a test of higher levels is likely.

So far, this is not a full-fledged rebound, and the indicated situation should only be traded intraday. In the medium term, we still haven't broken the downward trend, so we're waiting for the resolution.

 Buying zones:  $56,700-$56,000 (volume zone), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies), level $48,000.

 Selling zones:  level: $58,700-$59,400 (mirrored volume zone, with offset), $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes).

 Interesting altcoins.

For this coin, we broke the descending trendline and formed an interesting volume zone of $0.0495-$0.0485, from which, if there's a reaction, we open a long position with the first target of ~$0.054.

Hello, this is Chartist.

Let‚Äôs briefly analyze the Bitcoin chart.

I am considering the possibility of a 'rebound' and will provide two reasons to support this view.


First, let's look at the 4-hour chart.



Last month, Bitcoin dropped to 49K and quickly rebounded. 

Although there was a price correction afterward, the yellow candles acted as crucial support for another upward move.

Notably, when Bitcoin dropped on the 4th of last month, we can see it also received support at the same level.

This suggests that the yellow supply zone remains a valid support area, and as long as this support holds, a rebound is likely.


Next, let‚Äôs look at the 15-minute chart.



Bitcoin is currently moving within a specific channel, with price action forming around the middle and top of the channel.

Although there was a brief break below the channel with a red candle, if this pattern turns out to be a bear trap,
there is a strong chance of a rebound back to the middle or top of the channel.

A bear trap occurs when the market appears to be dropping but actually reverses to the upside, misleading traders.

Therefore, holding the bottom of the channel is critical, and if this fails, we need to be cautious of further declines.


< Summary >

- Reason for rebound 1 : Valid support from the yellow supply zone on the 4-hour chart.

- Reason for rebound 2 : Movement within the channel on the 15-minute chart and the possibility of a "Bear Trap".

- Caution : If the bottom of the channel fails to support, be wary of additional declines.

‚Äª This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
‚Äª It is a personal perspective and should be used for reference only.
‚Äª All decisions and responsibilities are yours.
Its buy probabilty BTCUSD
BASED ON volume flow and neural network
Bitcoin was rejected from the $58k level yesterday. Right now, I could see a move higher, but until the trend has changed, we will continue to make lower lows. One level to keep an eye on is still the low at $54.5k.
BTC PA has been very good in fighting the shorts lately. Expecting a final push to get rid of all the late shorts before the actual dump starts. It will be quick and dirty. They will not make it easy for us.
Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken.
Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken.
Overall, a Short update of the analysis implies a cautiously optimistic outlook with a focus on the $52,408 support level as a crucial point. If Bitcoin can maintain above this level, a bounce towards higher levels within the descending channel is anticipated, with a potential test of the upper resistance line around $70,000. However, if this support fails, further downside pressure could ensue.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.
BTC Bitcoin long Fair Value Gap & Golden Pocket confluence for a high probability 3:1 risk:reward trade.
BTC may decline back to $49,950, however this is likely WORST CASE SCENARIO and should be aggressively bought. Actual invalidation of bull market at 38500--however reaching this price is very unlikely.

 Full target of Bull Flag: 110K!! 
See for more information on bull flags-- not all of them reach their price targets! : www.thepatternsite.com

Price in potential Local Trading range--unconfirmed on bottom, must break above small white line at current price for confirmation of trading range. Until then, expect gradual declines potentially to 49,950. Once small white line broken, longs until top of the trading range can be taken.

üìà  Technical analysis BTC/USDT 

The price of Bitcoin continues to fall and has remained below the EMA 200 and EMA 50 moving averages for over a week. A hidden bearish divergence is forming on the RSI indicator. If the support level at $56,000 fails to hold against selling pressure, we expect a move into the Imbalance 1H zone, where the gaps on the horizontal volume levels need to be filled through trading. In the range of $50,000 - $52,000, we anticipate the correction to conclude and the trend to reverse. Otherwise, the price may head into the next Imbalance 4H zone, where it could experience a deep freefall, potentially leading to a retest of the global upward trend line. This is due to the lack of significant resistance blocks and large gaps on the horizontal volume levels in this area.

For the price to resume its upward movement, BTC needs to break above the dynamic resistance line of the EMA 200 and secure a position above the ascending trend line. This would pave the way for a retest of the $65,000 resistance level and further movement towards the global trend line and the major resistance block at $70,000 - $75,000.

  


üìâ  Bitcoin market global analysis 

On the daily logarithmic chart, Bitcoin's price continues to move within a broadening wedge pattern. Currently, the price is approaching a retest of the 200-day moving average, and the outcome of this retest will determine its future direction. Globally, the descending wedge is considered a bullish corrective pattern. However, before breaking out upwards and resuming its growth, BTC may test the lower boundary of the wedge near the 0.61-0.78 Fibonacci retracement levels, where the global support trendline is also located. Such a scenario would present a good opportunity to accumulate long-term positions before the final rally of this Bitcoin cycle.

Above the current ATH, there are no resistance levels based on historical data. Therefore, to set growth targets, we will use trendlines, Fibonacci extension levels, and an analysis of large order blocks in order books. The first 1.23 Fibonacci extension level is located at $80,000. In the $90,000 - $100,000 range, there is a global trendline built on the peaks of the two previous Bitcoin cycles, along with the 1.38 Fibonacci extension level. The highest trendline is in the range of the 1.61 - 1.78 Fibonacci extension levels, with its test potentially starting at the $100,000 level.

üìä  Fundamental analysis 

In September, the cryptocurrency market is facing significant uncertainty. There has been a continued outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Last week alone, $305 million was withdrawn from cryptocurrency-based investment products, and on the last trading day, ETFs collectively lost $287.7 million, marking the third-largest daily outflow.

Bitcoin historically tends to decline in September, with BTC consistently showing negative performance during this month. Since 2013, its price has dropped by an average of 4.78% in September. Analysts have also noted a decrease in stablecoin inflows, indicating that market participants are expecting further price declines. However, if history repeats itself, BTC could see significant growth starting in October, as large players are already increasing their positions and withdrawing Bitcoin from exchanges.

Major Wall Street indices ended Tuesday's trading session with losses, driven by negative trends in the technology, commodities, and oil and gas sectors. Looking ahead, the U.S. economic calendar is packed with important events, including the upcoming presidential elections. Experts predict that cryptocurrencies will become increasingly sensitive to developments surrounding potential changes in U.S. monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is set to make a decision on the key interest rate on September 18. Previously, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated a likely reduction in the key interest rate, boosting investor optimism.

üåê Upcoming Events in the Global Economy

We expect increased volatility in both stock and cryptocurrency markets on the following dates:

‚û§ 09/06, 15:30 - US unemployment data for August.

‚û§ 09/11, 15:30 - US consumer inflation index (CPI) for August.

‚û§ 09/18, 21:00 - New Fed interest rate decision.

‚û§ 11/05, 00:00 - US presidential election.

‚û§ 11/07, 21:00 - New Fed interest rate decision.


üìà  Statistics of signals from our AI trading indicator: 

In August, the Bitcoin price continued falling, and then the market began to slowly recover. Our trading indicator, as always, warned about this in advance!

Bitcoin Market Analysis - September 4 

Greetings, this is full time trader88

Today, I will be discussing Bitcoin's market conditions with a focus on psychological analysis rather than chart-based insights.

In summary, I am leaning towards a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. The key support level I am monitoring is $54.5K. However, given that this analysis emphasizes psychological factors over technical chart details, I will refrain from in-depth chart analysis.


Psychological Analysis:

 1. Uncertainty in Support Levels 

Currently, the delineation of support levels appears ambiguous. There is significant variation among traders regarding the precise level of support. Although I have identified $54.5K as a potential support level, this does not imply it is the definitive answer. This ambiguity reflects the current disorder within the chart.


 2. Stop-Loss Triggers 

It is likely that many traders who took long positions have experienced multiple stop-loss triggers (myself included). Especially when the price was above $57K, the market dynamics were confusing, often leading to indecision between long and short positions. This difficulty, while possibly a result of my own limitations, highlights the general complexity of the current market conditions.


 3. Volume at the Lower Wick 

The lower wick formed this morning at approximately $55,555 (Binance Futures) has shown notable trading volume. Particularly, when observed on a 15-minute chart, this represents the largest trading volume since early August. This suggests significant market activity at this level, indicating potential whale interest, even if it involves smaller players.


 4. Predominant Market Sentiment 

Many traders are likely strategizing to buy around the  GETTEX:48K - GETTEX:54K  range, expecting this level to hold. There is a perception that a minor leverage position might be safe. Paradoxically, market forces may choose not to honor these levels, potentially leading to a scenario where the market moves unexpectedly. Given that a substantial number of retail traders have likely already exited their long positions, there could be a sudden upward move that catches many off guard.


 5. Revenge Trading 

Given the number of traders who have been shaken out of long positions, there is a risk of revenge trading. If the market shows even a slight upward movement, traders might seek to short the market. Market forces are likely to exploit this behavior by pushing the market higher while avoiding the long positions that were previously liquidated.


 6. Challenges in Entering Long Positions 

If a substantial upward move occurs, it may become increasingly difficult to enter long positions at desirable levels. Traders might hesitate to buy higher, preferring to wait for lower prices.


 7. Conclusion 

Based on the aforementioned points, I anticipate a heightened probability of an unexpected upward movement. Key factors include the possibility of market movements deviating from retail traders' expectations and the tendency for markets to start upward trends without accommodating retail positions.

Please note, this analysis is based on my personal perspective and is not grounded in empirical evidence. It is essential to exercise your own judgment and not rely solely on these insights.

Thank you for your attention.

Bitcoin (BTC) remained bearish, as the king coin was trading under $57k at press time. While this initially looked disastrous, for savvy investors, this might as well be a right opportunity to buy the dip.

According to CoinMarketCap, BTC‚Äôs price dropped by more than 3% in the last seven days. In the last 24 hours alone, the king coin witnessed a nearly 4% price fall. 

Meanwhile, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet revealing a bullish development. Top BTC traders on Binance showed a slight bullish tilt, with 51.79% investors holding long positions on BTC. 

Generally, a rise in the number of long positions in the market hint at an increase in bullish sentiment around an asset.

As pet the chart, The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick. This indicated that BTC‚Äôs bearish price action might end soon. 

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved southwards, meaning that the possibility of BTC falling further can‚Äôt be ruled out yet.
Bitcoin is sitting at the lows of the larger range, right on a key area of support. Things look predictably shaky, not much for bulls to hang their hats on at the moment, as price continues to drift down. 

Does that mean new lows are coming? No. It means we have the crappy price action that we tend to see at this part of the cycle, and little else.

That said, if you are the type to buy support as a trader, the risk reward here is decent for a quick trade. I won‚Äôt be taking it.
Bitcoin has started September on a weak note, with both its monthly and weekly closes reflecting a lack of bullish momentum. Historically, September has been a challenging month for Bitcoin, often dubbed a ‚Äúred patch‚Äù for returns. 

Despite this, some analysts still see the potential for Bitcoin to reach the mid-$60,000 range in the short term. The $56,000 and $54,000 levels are being eyed by traders as possible short-term targets before any relief rally. 

A clear spot buyer around $57,000 has provided some support, but the overall lack of interest in derivatives markets indicates that funding rates may remain low or negative.
üìä#BTC reaches support zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, falling below the neckline means that a larger short structure has emerged, and the overall trend direction is biased towards the short side. A break below the bullish defense level at the 4-hour level means we have swept the liquidity pools, so a strong rebound is reasonable. There are two resistances we can see at present. One is resistance near the neckline 57093, and the other is strong resistance near the turning point 58250.

‚û°Ô∏èFrom the perspective of wave theory, we can clearly see an Elliott pulse wave. Wave 5 stops exactly in the support zone, so it is also expected to rebound.

‚û°Ô∏èBut the overall direction is biased towards the downward trend. If we want to reverse this trend, we need to build a long structure above the hourly level near the support area. Otherwise, don‚Äôt be too optimistic.

Yesterday,  Bitcoin  bounced off the sell zone of $59,000-$59,550, which we noted on Monday. We tested the $58,000 zone, where we saw a volume reaction, but there was no consolidation above this mark, and the buyer did not resume.
After that, we began to implement the scenario with a test of the $56,000 level.

At the moment, the price action is quite weak, and the lows are also being updated weakly, but at this stage, opening long positions is too risky. Above, we have a sell zone of $58,000-$59,400, and only after consolidating above it does it make sense to look for a long position. Until then, we will remain in a stable bearish trend.
There is a high probability of a full breakout of the local low and a test of the global buyer zone of $53,000-$50,000, so we are waiting for the culmination and for now, we are sitting without positions on the first cryptocurrency.

 Sell zones:  level: $58,000-$59,400 (mirror volume zone), $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes).

 Buy zones:  $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies), level $48,000.

 Interesting altcoins.
 
Yesterday we looked at the  ORDI  coin, for which we received a reaction from the marked zone of $31-$30.3, but unfortunately, there was no full rebound, and a volume defense from sales appeared above.
At the moment, a more interesting situation is developing for this asset.
We tested an important volume zone located below, from which a strong buying reaction followed. Large cluster anomalies were formed at the price of $29.6. Upon returning to this mark, we may see a full reversal with the potential to renew the level of $32.85
We didn't receive a trade signal from the internal demand zones during the retracement as expected. Instead, the price action moved decisively through these zones fulfilling the target of the PO3. Now, I'm closely monitoring to see if we get a structural shift, either from the range low deviation or the old demand zone/45-minute order block. If this flip occurs, I'll be looking to enter a long position.

In this scenario, we retest $58k and move lower to reach the low at $54.6k. These price moves should be watched closely as they can become volatile with falling stock prices and economic data. Today the JOLTS job openings will be released which could cause volatility. If the economic data turns out to be bad for the dollar in the next few days, the upside scenario could continue and we would re-enter the area where we are trading sideways.

Bitcoin: Time for the Bears to Take Control 

Bitcoin has just confirmed the beginning of a bearish wave. 

This time, sellers increased the bearish momentum before BTC could reach the $69K mark again.

 You may watch the video for further details
Thank you! 

 Previous video analysis:
When the BTCUSDT hourly chart is examined; It is observed that the price movements continue in a downward trend. As long as the crypto's level of 58449 cannot be passed upwards, it is evaluated that in price movements below the level of 57210, it can break the level of 55685 and retreat to the level of 53952.
BTC Losing Bullish Momentum 

In our previous analysis, BTC performed as expected, creating a correction. 
This was the ideal scenario before the onset of a bearish wave.

Today, the release of the US PCE data could potentially drive BTC lower.

Last night, BTC tested the $61K resistance zone, which was close to our reversal zone, increasing the likelihood of a bearish movement.

If everything goes as anticipated, BTC should test the $56.1K and $50K levels.

 You may find more details in the chart!

   - The chart shows a continuation of the downtrend within a clearly defined descending channel, marked by the parallel blue lines. This suggests persistent bearish sentiment in the market.

2.Support and Resistance Levels:
   - Key support levels are around 57,000 USDT and 55,000 USDT. The price recently tested the lower boundary of the channel near 56,000 USDT and shows a potential attempt to hold this level.
   - Resistance levels are visible at approximately 58,000 USDT, 59,000 USDT, and the upper boundary of the descending channel. These levels will be crucial for any bullish reversal attempts.

3.Recent Price Movement:
   - BTC has been making lower highs and lower lows, adhering closely to the descending channel pattern.
   - A recent sharp drop took the price close to the 56,000 USDT mark, indicating increased selling pressure.
   - The price briefly touched the lower boundary of the descending channel, suggesting that the downtrend remains intact.

4.Potential Scenarios:
   -Bearish Continuation: If the price fails to break above the descending channel, it could continue its downward trajectory, potentially testing the 55,000 USDT support level.
   -Bullish Reversal: A break above the upper boundary of the descending channel and subsequent resistance at 58,000 USDT could indicate a potential reversal or at least a short-term relief rally.

5.Volume and Momentum:
   - The absence of volume data on the chart makes it challenging to gauge the strength behind recent moves, but the price action suggests continued weakness.
   - Watch for divergence between price and momentum indicators (such as RSI, if available) that might hint at a weakening of the downtrend or the beginning of a reversal.

6.Market Sentiment:
   - The persistent downtrend within the channel shows that the market sentiment remains bearish.
   - Traders should monitor how the price interacts with the key support at 55,000 USDT and resistance at the channel boundaries for signs of trend changes.

In summary, BTC is currently in a strong downtrend, with key support levels at 56,000 USDT and 55,000 USDT. The market remains bearish, and any potential bullish reversal would require a break above the descending channel and confirmation above resistance levels around 58,000 USDT. Keep an eye on price action and market reactions at these critical levels.
In my opinion, Bitcoin will rise a little and continue its decline from there
Macro Overview

- Investors have withdrawn over 2,500 BTC, keeping the total balance stable at just over three million BTC. Additionally, more than $287.8 million has been pulled out of spot Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting an increase in risk-averse sentiment. Retail investors are becoming more cautious, and the lack of strong catalysts is dampening overall optimism.

Technical Analysis

- BTCUSD retested around 60,000, coinciding with the 78-day EMA, before sharply declining. The price is currently within a descending channel, signaling a sideways-to-downward trend. If BTCUSD recovers above 60,000, the price could retest the resistance at 61,800. Meanwhile, a close below 56,650 may suggest a further decline to the next support level at 54,600.
structure has been intact for some time, showing consistent lower highs and lower lows. 


The horizontal support line at approximately $52,408 is a key level to watch. It has previously acted as a significant support zone, suggesting that any retest of this level could provide a strong base for a potential upward movement. 


The chart features a prominent arrow suggesting a bullish reversal from near the lower support line and $52,408. This implies an expectation that the price will find support here and begin an upward move toward the upper boundary of the descending channel. 


The upper trendline of the channel around $68,000 serves as the primary resistance level. A breakout above this level would indicate a significant shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to a larger bullish move. 


The broader trend within the channel remains bearish until a breakout occurs. However, the emphasis on the support level and projected upward movement indicate a cautious bullish outlook in the short term, pending confirmation of a reversal signal. 


The chart suggests that BTC is nearing a critical support zone of around $52,408, where a potential long opportunity could arise if the price action confirms a bounce. The key to a sustained bullish trend will be breaking above the descending channel‚Äôs resistance line, currently near $68,000. If this occurs, it would likely trigger a more pronounced upward trend.

Hello everyone,

Let's analyse BTCUSDT in daily Timeframe!!

Bitcoin is currently trading within a defined pattern. The recent low volume and weak momentum has been driving the price downward.
Analyzing the 4hr chart reveals a potential Head and Shoulders pattern, suggesting a possible bearish reversal. The 200-day Moving Average (MA) is proving to be a significant resistance level.
Bitcoin has frequently bounced off the green support zone between $56,611 and $58,038, indicating weakening support. However, there is a risk of a further decline towards the lower trendline of the pattern, which aligns with the 400-day MA.
Liquidity is concentrated below $55,700, creating a potential support zone around $53,000.
A daily close above $60,863 could signal a bullish reversal.

Current Support Levels :
$56611 to $57255 (short term)
$52895
$48950

Resistance Levels:
$59636
$60863

Fractal Analysis 
 
 Fractals in trading help identify potential reversal points by marking significant price changes. Our strategy calculates a "fractal value" by comparing the current price to recent high and low fractal points. This is done by evaluating the sum of distances from the current closing price to the recent highs and lows. A positive fractal value suggests proximity to recent lows, hinting at upward momentum. Conversely, a negative value indicates closeness to recent highs, signaling potential downward movement.
 

 Moving Averages for Confirmation 
 
 We use a series of 20 moving averages ranging from 5 to 100 to confirm trend directions indicated by fractal analysis. An entry signal is considered bullish when shorter-term moving averages are all above a long-term moving average, aligning with a positive fractal value.
 
 
 Exit Strategy 
 
 The strategy employs dynamic stop-loss levels set at various moving averages, allowing for partial exits when the price crosses below specific thresholds. This helps manage the trade by locking in profits gradually. A full exit might be triggered by strong reversal signals suggested by both fractal values and moving average trends.
 

This open-source strategy is available for the community to test, adapt, and utilize. Your feedback and modifications are welcome as we refine the approach based on collective user experiences.

Greetings, Traders, üòâ

In this post, I‚Äôd like to share my analysis and outlook on Bitcoin's potential price movement.

Currently, my outlook leans towards an upward trend.

Before diving into the details, I recommend reviewing my previous post that covers Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory to provide better context for the following analysis:

‚¨áÔ∏è Previous Analysis


Have you gone through it?
Excellent, let‚Äôs proceed with the rationale behind my current bullish outlook.

-

‚úîÔ∏è BTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / First Rationale

I have analyzed the price movement of Bitcoin starting from July 4, 2024. Currently, Bitcoin is trading within a descending channel.

Within this channel, the price has strongly respected the "Half Line," which enhances the credibility of the channel.

Interestingly, I have divided the channel into four sections, labeling them as  "Quarter Lines." 

Historical price action indicates significant resistance at these Quarter Lines, making it likely that we could see meaningful movements at these levels once again.

Moreover, it‚Äôs worth noting that a descending channel often breaks to the upside, while an ascending channel typically breaks to the downside.

To put it simply:

 Descending Channel ‚Üí Likely to break upward
Ascending Channel ‚Üí Likely to break downward 

Since the current chart forms a descending channel, it suggests a higher probability of an upward breakout.


‚úîÔ∏è BTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Second Rationale

Key elements to observe in this chart include:

 
  200 SMA (Simple Moving Average)
  Stop Hunt
  Ascending Channel
 

Based on these elements, the anticipated movement can be viewed as follows:


The Stop Hunt might induce a brief sell-off, followed by a bullish reversal‚Äîa strategy commonly employed by large market participants.

 Given that the Half Line of the channel coincides with the Stop Hunt zone,  this area becomes particularly significant.


‚úîÔ∏è BTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 1H / Third Rationale

Focus on the  "Trap"  that has appeared near the lower boundary of the ascending channel.

A  "Trap"  is a movement designed by market makers to shake out less experienced traders.

The interpretation here is straightforward:

 
 The price briefly breaks below the ascending channel, triggering stop-loss orders from retail traders.
 These retail traders are forced to exit their positions.
 After the Trap, the price often moves to the opposite side of the channel. The current chart suggests a high likelihood of such a movement.
 


‚úîÔ∏è BTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Fourth Rationale

This rationale is based on the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator and focuses on the concept of  "Hidden Bullish Divergence." 

The conditions for this are as follows:

 Price: Left < Right
RSI: Left  > Right 

Given that these conditions are met, it‚Äôs reasonable to expect upward momentum.

Additionally, a  "Regular Bullish Divergence"  is also observed:


The conditions for this are:

 Price: Left  > Right 
RSI: Left  < Right  

Again, these conditions suggest the potential for a bullish reversal.

-

 
Let‚Äôs summarize the key points of today‚Äôs analysis:

‚¨áÔ∏è First Rationale: Descending Channel

If the price maintains support at the Quarter Line, a bullish move can be expected.

‚¨áÔ∏è Second Rationale: 200 SMA, Stop Hunt, and Ascending Channel

Based on the convergence of these three factors, a bullish scenario seems likely.
 
‚¨áÔ∏è Third Rationale: Trap

The  "Trap"  is designed to deceive retail traders, and its occurrence often signals a move to the opposite side of the channel.

‚¨áÔ∏è Fourth Rationale: Bullish Divergences

Both Hidden and Regular Bullish Divergences have been identified, further supporting the case for an upward movement.

-

 
In conclusion, I am maintaining my bullish outlook on Bitcoin.

 I plan to uphold this perspective unless the aforementioned factors are invalidated. 

Any updates will be communicated through an updated post.

Thank you for reading, and if you found this analysis helpful, please consider giving it a boost and following me for future updates.

‚úîÔ∏è This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
‚úîÔ∏è It is a personal perspective and should be used for reference only.
‚úîÔ∏è All decisions and responsibilities lie with you.
Hello Friends,

Right now,  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  roams around the POC. I recommend  waiting  until the price starts to move away from POC.

If price reach 61-62000 area and volume jumped, we can think about opening short trade (54000 is the TARGET)

In case BTC drop from here, 54000 should be a good area to take long trade!

Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are broken
Bitcoin's larger structure is bearish, and we also recently had an mCH on the chart.  Bitcoin is now trading below a downtrend line.

It is expected to sweep sell orders after reaching the supply range and then drop downwards.

Closing a 4-hour candle above the invalidation level will violate the analysis.

For risk management, please don't forget stop loss and capital management
Comment if you have any questions
Thank You
Currently, Bitcoin is trading within a falling wedge pattern, a formation that often suggests a potential bullish reversal. While the price has not yet broken out of the wedge, there is a possibility of bullish momentum in the coming days. If this momentum materializes, Bitcoin could target the $62,000 and $64,000 resistance zones.

This is just my personal idea.
I'm simply sharing my opinion based on the current chart.
#BTC: No Major Changes Yet..!! Bitcoin has been consolidating within a Descending Broadening Wedge for the past six months. Breaking through the critical $69-70k resistance level is essential for the bulls to regain control. Despite multiple failed attempts, there is renewed optimism that this time could be different, as the resistance is showing signs of weakening.

A successful breakout above the Descending Broadening Wedge could propel Bitcoin towards the $100k mark in Q4. However, for now, leverage trading might not be the best approach. If you‚Äôre holding Bitcoin, it‚Äôs time to sit back and relax‚Äîthe next bull run could be just around the corner.

#Crypto #DYRO
We have gotten the bull break on the 15m we are watching our zones to see if we get the pull back entry.

BTC could flip at the old range high too so watch out for this.

2. Divergence on Market cipher

Remember to only risk 1% and look to de-risk your trade as soon as is reasonably possible.

Hello, this is Chartist.

Let‚Äôs dive into a brief analysis of the Bitcoin chart.



First, let's look at the daily chart.



Recently, Bitcoin has been declining and consolidating for five days before forming a bullish engulfing candlestick yesterday.

This indicates that the bullish momentum of one day is greater than the bearish momentum of the past five days.

A bullish engulfing candle can often be an early sign of a trend reversal.



Next, let's look at the 4-hour chart.



In the 4-hour chart, a Bear Trap pattern is observed. 

A Bear Trap occurs near the lower boundary of a channel, where the price drops below the channel only to quickly recover back within it.

If a swift recovery follows, there is a high probability that the price will reach the upper boundary of the channel.



Now, let's move on to the 15-minute chart.



Bitcoin has successfully broken above a red trendline and completed a retest, confirming the breakout.

Following this, it encountered resistance at a double-top pattern but managed to break through with a decisive bullish candle.

The previous resistance level around 58.8K has now flipped to support, demonstrating an S/R Flip, where resistance turns into support.

The S/R Flip is a key concept in technical analysis, indicating a significant shift in market dynamics where former resistance levels become support zones.

Currently, the former resistance is holding as support, which is a bullish signal.



 < Summary > 

1. A bullish engulfing candle has appeared after five days of decline, suggesting a potential reversal.

2. The emergence of a Bear Trap pattern near the lower channel boundary increases the likelihood of a rebound if the channel is maintained.

3. An S/R Flip is in play, with previous resistance now acting as support, reinforcing the case for a bullish reversal.
On a smaller timeframe, we can clearly see a dominance of sellers as well, where 200EMA has been tested multiple times but yet it has rejected the breakout attempts.

We are looking here for that red line to be broken, which would result in a bigger break of structure where price could start to fall toward the last lower zone, where price dumped near $49,000.

For sending Alerts from Tradingview to Telegram i made 2 tutorial vidoes. There were alot of requests to make a video  about sendign Alerts with screenshot of the chart . My friend  Trendoscope  also recommended to me to work on this feature , now i have made a video that does this task. 

To use this method Amazon AWS lambda service is used , what lambda does is that it provides us with a service that only uses processing power of amazon servers when the application is running . Most of its services for 1 year after sign up and afterwards the services are very cheap.

If there is any questions i would be happy to answer them .
For  Bitcoin , we are trying to execute the first scenario mentioned yesterday. We have already broken through the local downward line and reached the resistance zone of $59,000-$59,550, from which we received the first selling reaction.

Currently, we primarily expect a test of the price around ~$58,000, where repeated cluster-based protection was observed, followed by a price reaction and continuation of the upward movement. There is also a possibility of testing the local low of $57,150.

Overall, Bitcoin currently appears uncertain, with reduced trading volumes and no strong anchors, so any negative macro news could trigger a capitulation of the bulls and break through the lower levels, testing the zone of major volume anomalies $53,000-$50,000.

 Selling zones:  level $61,200, $63,000-$64,300 (accumulated volume zone).

B uying zones:  level ~$58,000 (buyer protection by clusters), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of major volume anomalies), level $48,000.

 Interesting altcoins. 

 ORDI  looks interesting. During the rise, a large zone of $31-$30.3 formed on the cluster chart, which is already positioned as a buying zone.
In the presence of a reaction, we open a long for the continuation of the upward movement.
Going long on  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  for various reasons 

1. Trend series of HH and HL's in short term
2. Just made a new HH and now is having a retrace and sitting above 50 EMA
3. Stoch RSI starting to turn up from oversold
4. Liquidation map shows liquidity around 58.5 and 58
5. Hitting support and an an order block

Targetting resistance above around 59.7
üíé#BITCOIN  / ‚è±4-Hour Timeframe

‚ÄºÔ∏èWith the start of the new month (September), the monthly pivots have been updated, and importantly, the price has encountered the monthly pivot (57877.92) from above as a support level.

‚úÖThis support is not the only one that #BITCOIN  has encountered, and the high of the bearish channel and the lower arm of the wedge should also be added to the supports.

‚úÖSo here we have a high density of supports.

‚ÄºÔ∏èOn the other hand, divergence based on the MACD indicator is evident.

üöÄAs a result, based on encountering these supports, the closest growth condition can be considered as breaking the upper arm of the wedge on the 4-hour timeframe.

üéØIf the mentioned growth condition is met, BITCOIN  can reach the following targets:
üöÄTarget 1: 59778.50
üöÄüöÄTarget 2: 62335.77 (suggested)
üöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 3: 66755.85

‚úÖConversely, if instead of breaking the wedge pattern upwards, it can re-enter the bearish channel and a valid breakout occurs, #BITCOIN  will continue its decline from this point and reach the following targets:

üîªTarget 1: Midline of the channel
üîªüîªTarget 2: Bottom of the channel
üîªüîªüîªTarget 3: 50096.07
Higher risk entries are like betting on a new star system's formation‚Äîexciting but with a high chance of failure. Lower risk entries? They're more like navigating known routes with a bit of turbulence. 

In the grand space opera of trading, remember, every entry point, whether high or low risk, comes with its own set of cosmic uncertainties. So, whether you're aiming for the stars or just trying to avoid black holes, keep your spacesuit on, your helmet sealed, and maybe, just maybe, have a towel handy. Because in the market, as in space, you never know when you'll need one. 

Disclaimer: All trading involves risk, even if it's as low as a neutron star's gravity. Always strap in with stop-losses and never invest more than you can afford to lose. And remember, even in space, nobody can hear you scream... or celebrate your gains.

Macro Overview

Bitcoin's price remained stable with quiet trading activity over the weekend and on Labor Day. Long-term holders have accelerated their accumulation since last weekend, with the illiquid supply surging to an all-time high of over 14.5 million BTC. Retail investors are staying on the sidelines due to the lack of significant catalysts, and prices may continue to decline.

Technical Analysis

BTCUSD briefly retested the 56,650-57,800 zone and closed higher, breaking out of the descending wedge pattern, indicating a potential recovery. If BTCUSD extends above the psychological level of 60,000, the price could retest the 61,800 resistance level. Meanwhile, a close below 60,000 may suggest trading within the range of 57,800-60,000.

1. Market Analysis:

Asset: Bitcoin (BTC)
Pattern: Bullish BAT Harmonic
Key Price Levels: $42,000 - $38,000
2. Harmonic Pattern Details:

BAT Pattern Overview: The BAT pattern is a harmonic pattern that consists of specific Fibonacci retracement levels. It is considered bullish when it completes near the 88.6% retracement level of the XA leg.

X to A: The initial move, which could be a sharp rally in this case.
A to B: A retracement to 38.2% or 50% of the XA move.
B to C: Another rally or drop that retraces 38.2% to 88.6% of the AB move.
C to D: The final leg that completes the pattern, retracing 88.6% of the XA move, typically signaling a potential reversal.
Completion Zone (D): The pattern suggests that BTC could find strong support between $42,000 and $38,000, which is where the pattern completes. This zone is critical for the potential bullish reversal.

3. Trade Setup:

Entry Point: Consider entering a long position if BTC reaches the $42,000 - $38,000 zone and shows signs of a reversal, such as bullish candlestick patterns, increased buying volume, or confirmation from other technical indicators.

Stop-Loss: Set the stop-loss slightly below the $38,000 level to protect against a deeper move down. This placement accounts for potential market noise while safeguarding your capital.

Take-Profit: Determine your take-profit target based on key resistance levels above $42,000. Possible targets could be around $48,000, $52,000, or even higher, depending on the market structure.

4. Risk Management:

Position Size: Calculate your position size based on your risk tolerance and the distance between your entry point and stop-loss level. Only risk a predetermined percentage of your trading capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%).

Risk-Reward Ratio: Aim for a favorable risk-reward ratio, ideally 1:2 or higher. This means if your stop-loss is $4,000 below your entry, your take-profit should be at least $8,000 above your entry.

5. Additional Confirmation:

Volume Analysis: Look for increased volume as BTC approaches the $42,000 - $38,000 zone. A spike in volume could indicate strong buying interest and confirm the potential reversal.

Fibonacci Levels: Use Fibonacci retracement levels to identify potential resistance zones for take-profit targets.

6. Trade Execution:

Place Orders: Set your buy order, stop-loss, and take-profit levels according to the above criteria.

This is my September outlook for bitcoin, because this month is notoriously negative sum in terms of returns - it's one of the worst month's performance wise in the last 4 years, and I don't see why it would be different now.

Everybody is extremely bullish and is expecting the price to continue rallying so that the liquidity at 65k can be liquidated and propel us into price discovery.

What if I told you, that institutions will determine what happens the price this time around. It is no longer us mere mortals that have the push and pull on price action.

Ask yourself this:

Would institutions rather the price to drop to 50k to secure even more bitcoin, allowing them a greater time horizon to onboard more investors - thereby inherently reducing their average buy in and ultimately increasing their profit ceiling long term?

Or,

Would institutions rather the price pumped into price discovery right now, before they've managed to onboard as many as possible and secure as much of the remaining supply that they can?

It's possible price pumps from here, but I'm leaning on Option 1 and the fact that this month has resulted in so many blown out accounts in previous years, I see no reason why it'll be different this time around.

People fade history, until history repeats.

Which side will you be sitting on as things play out?

Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) is facing a challenging period as investors increasingly position themselves for a potential downturn. The recent outflows of $319 million from Bitcoin funds, including those managed by prominent players like Fidelity and ARK Invest, reflect a growing sentiment among market participants who expect the digital asset‚Äôs price to decline in September. This shift comes amid broader concerns over economic conditions, Federal Reserve policy, and heightened market volatility. 

Market Sentiment and Price Movements
The Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) market has experienced notable turbulence, with its price currently trading at $58,466 per coin, down more than 7% over the past week. This decline is part of a broader trend, with the asset now 20% below its all-time high of $73,737 reached earlier this year. Market participants are closely monitoring Bitcoin's exchange reserves, which have hit a multi-year low of 2.39 million BTC, representing a 25% drop from their 2020 peak. This significant decrease suggests a growing shift towards self-custody, which could potentially reduce selling pressure in the long term.

Key Technical Indicators:
- Price Volatility: Bitcoin's price recently dipped to a low of $57,257.71 before bouncing back above $58,000, indicating a recovery amid continued market volatility. However, the market's mixed signals are contributing to uncertainty, with liquidation data revealing $169.2 million in liquidations across the crypto market in just the past 24 hours, with long positions accounting for $125.59 million of that total.

- On-Chain Activity: Analysts are closely watching on-chain whale activity, ETF inflows and outflows, and other key metrics to gauge market sentiment. Notably, there has been an uptick in short Bitcoin investment products, which saw $4.4 million in inflows last week, the highest since March. This highlights a growing number of traders betting against Bitcoin, anticipating further price declines.

Economic Data and Federal Reserve Policy
The fundamental backdrop for Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) is being shaped by macroeconomic factors, particularly those related to U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve policy decisions. Stronger-than-expected economic data has led investors to believe that the likelihood of a significant interest rate cut by the Fed has diminished, reducing risk appetite for Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies.

Key Fundamentals:
- Interest Rates and Market Sentiment: With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates less aggressively than previously anticipated, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are considered "risk-on" assets, are seeing reduced investor interest. High-interest rates typically make safer, yield-bearing investments more attractive compared to volatile assets like Bitcoin.

- Regulatory Environment: The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. was initially seen as a positive catalyst for the market. However, recent outflows from these funds suggest that institutional investors are growing cautious, potentially due to regulatory uncertainties and shifting economic conditions.

BlackRock and the Divergence in Institutional Behavior
While most Bitcoin funds experienced outflows, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, saw inflows of over $219 million into its iShares Bitcoin ETF. This divergence indicates a split in institutional sentiment, with some investors still seeing long-term value in Bitcoin despite near-term market headwinds.

What This Means for Investors:
- Hedging Strategies: Investors who remain committed to the crypto space are increasingly looking at hedging strategies, such as short Bitcoin products, to mitigate downside risks. This aligns with broader market sentiment, where caution and risk management are taking precedence.

- Focus on Long-Term Trends: Despite short-term challenges, the decrease in Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) held on exchanges and the continued adoption of self-custody solutions suggest underlying confidence in the asset‚Äôs long-term value proposition. If demand continues to grow, reduced selling pressure could pave the way for a future bullish trend.

Conclusion
The current market dynamics present a complex landscape for Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) investors. As macroeconomic factors weigh on sentiment, traders are adjusting their strategies, focusing on risk management, and exploring derivative products to navigate the volatility. While the short-term outlook appears cautious, the evolving market structure, characterized by declining exchange reserves and divergent institutional behavior, could set the stage for significant opportunities once economic conditions stabilize.

Investors are advised to keep a close eye on key economic data releases, Federal Reserve actions, and on-chain metrics as these factors will play a critical role in shaping Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory in the coming months.

### BTC/USDT Technical Analysis (1D)

**Overview:**
Bitcoin is trading below the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs, within a descending channel, indicating a bearish trend. A break above these EMAs could trigger bullish price action.

**Key Points:**

- **Resistance:** $61,802 (channel top), $60,364.
- **Support:** $54018, 47,710, $43,882.
- **Invalidation Level:** $54,018 (daily close below).

**Scenarios:**
1. **Bullish:** Break above EMAs and channel top could target $68,000.
2. **Bearish:** Failure to break above EMAs and a close below $54,018 may lead to a drop towards $47,710 or lower.

**Conclusion:**
I think the price must break soon in the next few weeks, likely following our scenario with the blue forecast lines. Watch for a breakout above the EMAs for bullish potential; otherwise, expect further downside within the channel.

#PEACE
Assalamu Alaikum and Good Evening to all Brothers and Sisters,

#Bitcoin dropped over the weekend, and as predicted, that was not a real movement. The real movement will be known just on Monday evening. We can now see that the price is back again above our daily support (Arrow #4).

What's Next?  
Yesterday's daily candle closed below the Daily Support (Arrow #4). The price must stay above yesterday's candle, or even better, it has to close above our daily support line. Then, we can start looking again for buy trades.

#ALTS  
Many #ALTS hit stop-loss. Now, I suggest waiting for today's candle to close. Then, we will look for new buy trades, Insha'Allah.

I wish you all a very nice evening.
hello dear trader and investors 
This is my personal opinion about Bitcoin... The price has engulfed the previous high and formed the QM pattern in the weekly time frame... 
In my opinion, the next target can be made from the combination of RTM price action and harmonic patterns( ab=cd ) came to this conclusion...
Considering the difficulty of the network and having , I think it is very good to buy bitcoin in several steps..
good luck
CRYPTOCAP:BTC  is in a Descending Channel.

Around 24th of January 2024, BTC started the descending channel journey. Currently, this asset is a smaller channel.

Overall, should we say BTC has been selling?
Anyway, $58K, $56K &  GETTEX:54K  are some zones to look our for below the current price.

Risk management is still the king.
The chart shows a clear descending wedge pattern, which is generally considered a bullish reversal pattern. This suggests the potential for an upward breakout once the pattern completes.

The highlighted brown box indicates a critical support zone around the $42,500 to $52,000 range. A potential scenario shown by the green path suggests that the price may dip into this zone before reversing upwards.

The green line outlines a possible path where BTC could initially drop to test lower support levels near the trendline and within the support zone before rallying back upwards, potentially breaking above the resistance line near $64,000.

There appears to be a mention of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a bullish signal, suggesting the possibility of a strong upward move if the neckline is broken.

The ascending trendline from previous lows supports the idea that the broader market trend is still upward, reinforcing the likelihood of a bullish breakout.

the analysis suggests that while there might be some short-term downward movement to retest support, the longer-term outlook remains bullish, especially if Bitcoin can hold key support levels and break out of the current descending pattern.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you!
After two days of fluctuating, Bitcoin has finally closed above its weekly channel, and global markets have reopened. Currently, BTC is positioned on the significant weekly support at $57,000, where we are awaiting a suitable reaction that could drive the price back up.

On the higher timeframes, we are observing the formation of a potential ascending triangle above the monthly support level. This pattern could lead to a final correction before initiating wave 3 of an upward move. However, this process might extend over the next few months.
I don't like to say it but I'm seeing many reasons why bitcoin could be ready for a huge dump down to around 48k, on a down trending fibonacci I've set it all looks feasible after bouncing back up to the first resistance of 61% level then down and  retested78% level and failed now looks to have broken structure on a huge head and shoulders profile üò≥,  now has just rebounded back up from 57k to 58500 area,  I would be seeing a drop from here downwards, don't look good.
BTC path prediction : Its possible that BTC will complete this scenario
So, if Bitcoin is heading back up, it's not just riding on the whims of market sentiment or the technical analysis of a few clever humans. It's propelled by the collective belief in its scarcity, utility, and the ever-growing narrative of it being digital gold. 

Remember, in the grand scheme of the universe, Bitcoin's price movements might just be the equivalent of a small blip on the radar of cosmic events, but for us earthlings, it's the financial spectacle of our times. 

Keep your spacesuits on, your helmets secure, and your wallets ready; Bitcoin's trajectory might just be the most entertaining show in the galaxy right now. 

Disclaimer: All predictions come with a side of cosmic uncertainty. Invest wisely, or at least with a sense of humor, knowing that in the vast expanse of space, even Bitcoin's price is just a tiny, albeit exciting, speck.

As September begins BTC finds itself at the $58,000 mark after selling off for the entire week last week. A historically bad Month for the crypto market is being paired with the first FED rate cut since March 2022. 
Conflicting elements with one bearish and one potentially bullish, it will be interesting to see if the final month of Q3 is a slow one or whether this is the month where BTC can break its daily downtrend and continue the Bullrun.

I believe the 25bps vs 50bps rate cut is a huge point of contention, this week we have data releases for unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, jobless claims that could all give clues to the FEDs decision on the 18th September.

BTC finds itself below the 1D & 4H 200EMAs once again after falling short of the $65,ooo breakout. It seems there isn't really any rush to buy before we know of the FEDs decision, chopping and generally delivering max pain to the majority, unless you can be nimble on the LTFs nobody is winning here. 

This week the wait continues, we saw a glimpse of hope in the altcoin market recently but that has now been taken away again as BTC struggled. Finding those fundamentally sound projects ready for Q4 and beyond is still a top priority.
Been taken out Weekly liquidity on the uppside, now its time to take out the weekly liquidity to the downside. See you @ 47 000
After several days, the position not only did not weaken, but also strengthened at a better price - worth to enter.

Stay tuned.

  WHAT HAPPENED? 

Since the beginning of last week, we've moved to a decline in the first cryptocurrency. However, we faced the complete absence of a market buyer throughout the entire downward movement and the breakdown of important buy zones.

At the moment, we're trying to fix below the buy zone in terms of accumulated volumes. Sells are weak, lows aren't updated, there's an absorption of delta sells by limit buys.

All the trumps are on the buyer's side, but, unfortunately, he's in no hurry to play his cards and doesn't show up. 

  WHAT WILL HAPPEN: OR NOT? 

 We identify 2 possible scenarios: 

1. The breakdown of the inclined line in the upward direction, test of the mirror zone $59,000-$59,550. In this case, you can join the movement after an additional test of the ~$58,000 level (volume anomalies);

2. In the absence of a market buyer, we expect the decline to continue and the test of the $56,000 level. When implementing this scenario according to the wave theory, most likely, we'll make a breakthrough. Buys should be considered only when testing long-term liquidity and the $53,000-$50,000 volume anomaly zone.

 Sell zones:  $59,000-$59,550 (mirror zone), $61,200 level, $63,000-$64,300 (accumulated volume zone).

 Buy zones:  the level of ~$58,000 (when the first scenario is implemented), $53,000-$50,000 (volume anomalies zone),  $48,000 level.

Hello everyone, this is Full_time_trader88.

Let‚Äôs dive into the  Bitcoin market analysis  for September 2nd.




 (BTC 1H) 

First, I‚Äôd like to briefly review my previous analysis.

I was closely watching the 57.5K level (the previous low) as a key area. This level was important because:

It was the bottom of the trading range.
It was also the neckline of a Head and Shoulders pattern.
It was the lowest point of a falling wedge pattern.
It was the area where a bullish divergence was forming on the 4-hour chart.
Given all these factors, I considered it a very significant level. When this level was broken, I decided to cut my losses.

However, there hasn‚Äôt been any major movement since then. In other words, my previous analysis didn‚Äôt play out as expected.

With that said, it‚Äôs time to conduct a fresh analysis.




 (BTC 1H) 

A new falling wedge pattern is forming, with 2 touches on the upper trendline and 4 touches on the lower trendline. This pattern is showing strong reactions within its boundaries, making it a key pattern to watch at this time.





 (BTC 15M) 

On a shorter time frame, a double bottom has formed, with the key level being 57.1K. The breakout level for this double bottom pattern is around 58.8K. Therefore, I would draw support and resistance lines at 57.1K and 58.8K, respectively.





 (BTC 4H) 

Where has Bitcoin been consistently facing resistance recently? It‚Äôs struggling to break above the middle line of the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart, which coincides with the 20 MA. So, in effect, it hasn‚Äôt been able to break above the 20 MA.





 (BTC 1D) 

Naturally, the same applies to the daily chart‚ÄîBitcoin hasn‚Äôt been able to break above the middle line of the Bollinger Bands here either. The sequence should be:

First, a break above the middle line of the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart ‚Üí Then, a break above the middle line of the Bollinger Bands on the daily chart.





 (BTC CME 1H) 

Let‚Äôs also take a quick look at the CME chart.

Recently, two gaps have formed:

 Gap 1 ‚Üí $60,485~$61,880
Gap 2 ‚Üí $58,645~$58,910 

Gap 1 was partially filled but didn‚Äôt completely close. Gap 2 remains unfilled.

According to the well-known "gap theory" (the idea that prices tend to return to fill gaps), there are gaps above but none below.


 

1. The newly formed falling wedge pattern looks significant.

2. The middle line of the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart is crucial.

3. There are two gaps above in the CME chart, but none below. (No recent gaps below)
These are the key points to keep in mind.

That‚Äôs all for today. Thanks for reading.

This analysis is an update to the analysis you see below in the "Related Ideas" section

The supply range of the previous analysis was engulfed.
The price has stabilized on a flip range.
A bullish iCH has formed on the chart.
The price moved up with strong momentum.

These are signs that Bitcoin is willing to push itself to higher supply ranges.

It is logical and wise to look for sell/short positions from higher supply ranges with these signs.

In this update, we also updated the demand range.

Closing a daily candle above the invalidation level will violate the analysis

Thank You
Last week we had good pressure from sellers where bullish movement that happened the week before that got rejected fully. 

This is a great confirmation for a possible further downward movement where we see a great demand. 

Out gameplan is simple here, and this would be as it is called "worst-case scenario.".

As per usual, weekend trading has kept BTC in a crawl

Hi fellow traders,

Bitcoin  DERIBIT:BTCUSD.P  is declining a bit and making a nice downwards structure on the 1H frame. What we can see is building resistance on the 58K level. 

We can see that the short-term foresight shows a possible resistance in the form of a trend-line rejection. Additionally, a possible rejection from the exponential moving average (50 period) lies in the same area of interest. 

That building tension gives us a SHORT possibility whenever rejection is confirmed on a lower timeframe, looking forward to that sweet price-action :)

Happy Trading ^^
We recovered the wick from Sunday with the move lower just before the close of the weekly candle. I could see some mean reversion here on the table and a possible break or rejection near the daily open (offset) at $58.4k. Like always $58k region is key. A possible rejection can happen at the psychological low at $58.2k. Right now we are still in the range of $58k - $61k. London Session starts in 8 min and will start the day. Let's go. Trade safe!

 Are Institutions Your Friend? 
These days, one of the biggest changes in the crypto world is the entrance of big institutions into the market. There are several reasons why institutions have decided to join the crypto game:

 Chasing Liquidity : In recent years, the crypto market has attracted a huge amount of liquidity. Whenever there is a lot of money flowing in, institutions are sure to follow.

 Volatility Control:  The high volatility of the crypto market makes it appealing to investors looking for significant returns. Instead of putting money into risky stocks, some investors choose crypto. But institutions often step in to manage and control this volatility.

 Centralizing Assets : By turning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into more centralized asset instruments, governments can impose taxes on gains and track transactions. This makes it easier to deal with fraud and other issues.

‚Äú Imagine playing football with your friends‚Äîyou might score 20 goals. But in a professional game, goals are much harder to come by. ‚Äù
Similarly, with institutions in the crypto market, volatility will be managed, making it harder for small players to make big gains. The big players will always come out ahead because they buy from you, sell to you, charge fees on every transaction, and control the supply.  For these institutions, the concept of loss is almost nonexistent.

BTC/USDT is currently trading at $57,661, up 0.41%. The 2-hour chart shows that BTC trades within a descending channel, with immediate support near $57,300. The price has bounced off the lower boundary, indicating potential for a short-term upward move. Immediate resistance lies around $59,700, where the upper boundary of the descending channel intersects. A breakout above this level could drive BTC towards the $61,000 zone. Conversely, a failure to maintain current support could lead to a further decline towards $56,500. Watch for volume spikes as an indicator of potential breakout strength.

We have two signals here to consider: Moving Averages and Candlesticks.

Let's start with the moving averages because it is the easiest of the two.

‚ûñ Bitcoin moved below EMA8/13/21 weekly in July. After trading two weeks below, it recovered last week. This week we have a full rejection and the action is back below these moving averages. This is an ultra-bearish signal and confirms the bearish bias and potential. Major crash confirmed.

Now the candlesticks.

‚ûñ Bitcoin closed below the "weekly support" only once in 2024, that is in early July. After this close, it quickly recovered. Bitcoin traded 7 weeks above this level, blue line on the chart, and this week is closing below it.

‚ûñ A close below this level, confirmed within less than two hours, confirms major crash. This would be the weakest close since February 2024 if we skip the July candle.

üëâ In simple terms, these signals are pointing to a crash toward $43,000 and $38,000 within the coming weeks. No bullish signals are present. Everything is extremely bearish. Run for your life.

Namaste.
üìä#BTC Falling Wedgeüìà

Am expecting a big sell off tonight hence am writing this idea a bit early cause I don't want to miss it when it's time.

You guys really should stick with the trend. I see a lot of people in the chat getting bullish over a correction unware of he bigger picture.

In short todays weekly close is an investors nightmare as if the monthly close wasn't enough.

This thing is poised for 47-45k been calling it all along. 

And tonight in an hr or 2 I expect it to fall from the sky. I just hope it corrects a bit higher for me to get an entry cause I ain't gonna short it from here even though it looks like it can fall any moment now.

Conservative target is $56000 for now. All the way down to $54000. These targets aren't set in stone. My tp will be open unless am going to bed. If its falling I want to catch majority of the move before taking partials.

However, we need to check whether it can rise after receiving support near the 56K-61K section, which is the second section.

The StochRSI indicator appears to have entered the oversold section.

And, the StochRSI EMA indicator is located near the midpoint.

Therefore, it is thought that it will take time for StochRSI > StochRSI EMA to change to a state.

Since there is a possibility that the arrows shown on the TS - BW indicator will appear, even if it leads to an additional decline, the second section is expected to eventually become an important support and resistance section.

If the price is located near the second section, it is difficult to see it as a downward trend from a long-term perspective.

-
The strong support zone is the 3rd zone, i.e., around 42K-43K.

However, if USDT and USDC maintain a gap uptrend, it is not expected to fall to the 42K-43K zone.

It seems possible that it will touch the 0.707 (48064.07) area once again.

--------------------------------------------

(BTCUSDT 1W chart)

It is expected that the trend will be newly formed as volatility occurs around the week including September 16th.

Accordingly, the key is whether it can receive support around 56K and rise above 61K.

If it falls below 56K after a period of volatility and shows resistance,
1st: M-Signal on 1M chart
2nd: 48K
3rd: 42K-43K
You need to check for support near the 1st-3rd above.

The key is whether you can continue the upward trend along the important rising channel.

-
You need to check whether the StochRSI indicator enters the oversold zone as a new candle is created.

------------------------------------------------

(BTCUSDT 1D chart)

The section formed by the upper line of the short-term falling channel and the lower line of the medium- to long-term rising channel can be seen as the trend reversal zone.

Therefore, the area around 56K is an important section.

-
The StochRSI indicator is showing a change in slope in the oversold zone.

Accordingly, if the StochRSI indicator breaks out of the oversold zone and becomes StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, it is expected to enter a period where a buy can be made.

The important thing in this movement is which support and resistance points are supported.

-
The 57937.19 point is the HA-Low indicator point on the 1D chart.

Therefore, unless a new HA-Low indicator is created, the buy period is the 57937.19 section.

Therefore, when a new candle is created, I will update it again.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin when it rises above 29K.

The section expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.
1st: 43833.05
2nd: 32992.55

-----------------
All possibilities point to an increase with the completion of the correction, unless the market wants to do the opposite. There is a high probability that Bitcoin will reach $104,000. Warning: This is not a recommendation. This is just an analysis.
Bitcoin has entered a wave of decline and correction on a weekly basis with its liquidity above its ceiling last year and has changed the medium-term trend and is now registering lower floors and lower ceilings. If this trend is maintained, the mid-term target will be $45,000
btc looks like its ready to go up , im fine with it going up now or going up after one last big shakeout , this shakeout would be the red candle and id actually prefer this route since we could get a nice big wick created on the monthly and weekly charts for this new month / week we will soon begin
The current monthly candle appears neutral. It is likely to test the 0.618 and 0.5 Fibonacci retracement levels of that candle, which are around the 55k mark.

Following this, we could see a range forming, with the range high around 60k.

Despite the monthly close, there is still no clear trend on the higher time frame. We can expect more choppiness and sideways movement. I am working on identifying dates when the market sentiment might turn positive and will share them once I have more clarity.

Looking at Line chart we should bottom between 0.236-0.382. Max drawdown is 54k

What do you see?

Let me make my own interpretation first, then share your thoughts.

In 2022, it went to the IMB region, took its support and made its current peak.

The breakout was MSS because it closed above it while doing so. This is an uptrend signal.

And again it visited the IMB zone for support.

This candle is a June candle, so the next candle opening will be in October.

I hope this is clear enough for those who say there will be no more bulls.

Description 
---------------------------------------------------------------
The monthly chart for Bitcoin is displaying a pattern reminiscent of the 2020 COVID crash chart. In 2020, Bitcoin experienced a similar crash, leading to a significant wick in the monthly chart. We are currently observing a similar pattern in 2024, attributed to the market crash caused by recession fears. I anticipate a recovery in the price similar to what was witnessed in 2020. Such a recovery would confirm the presence of a bull market.

So, bulls recently missed a decent chance to gain control over the market by holding the 61k level but failed miserably. Now just want to put things into perspective, keep in mind, this analysis is NOT backed by usual TA rules, so this is rather a out-of-the-box approach on what is going on. 

As you can see I tried to highlight the obvious series of lower highs and lower lows on the daily chart. The lines are curved which is by no means the standard approach but it makes sense looking at the overall market structure. So one could assume we are in a mid-term downtrend, given BTC has been trading like this for the last 6 months already.

One thing is certain: This structure is going to end at some point. The question now is, what are we going to see first: A lower low or a higher high to finally break out of this downtrend?

Few days ago I was convinced we are going to see a push towards ~68k but now things have changed drastically. I wouldn't even say it's 50/50 as I'm slowly starting to lose hope but to give you some levels I think we need to see a strong break of 65-66k to become bullish again. However, if BTC decides to go for another lower low it might go as low as 46k, probably shaking out >80% of leveraged traders. 

Unfortunately this is how the market works and always has. Forcing people out of their positions by liquidating them, run their stops and the like. Another problem is, we have seen several agressive shakeouts past few weeks, so who is actually left to shook out? You'd be surprised how overleveraged this whole market is, so there is still room for another aggressive flush, probably 15-20% within a day. 

IF this happens, we REALLY want to see a quick recovery and not print a bearish flag below ~50k for another 2-3 weeks. 

As you can tell, I am leaning towards the lower low scenario but there is still a chance to prevent this from happening but the chances are slim, maybe 30%, but that's just a vague guess.

So basically, if you are a trader you should sit on your hands at this point. Alts are down brutally as we speak, so if you miss let's say 20-30% from the bottom that's totally acceptable. 

For BTC if you are a bull either wait for the lower low or wait for a CLEAR break of current market structure. Keep in mind there are technically no limits to the upside, so no need to time the exact bottom, which is pretty much gambling anyway. 

Will update if we have a clearer picture. I know this analysis is pretty vague but I'm not trying to create any false hopes for the clout. In the end, always do your own research and/or stay out of the market if there's uncertainty like now. 

Stay safe!

i have confidentially added long positions this past week and id like to share why ...
reasons for entry we have had a beautiful squeeze of a bull flag slowly falling to the daily golden fib zone and the 16k to 75k 0.382 fib zone , but my main interest in this chart is that weekly bullish doji with extremely high volume one of btcs highest weeks for volume. from my experience as a trader seeing a big bullish engulfing volume node from bear week to extreme bull week with that slicing of the cake of a doji candle in a nice area, as it hits both fibs and goes lowest its been since February causing etf buyers to be back to where they started in the 40-50k level. many people would class it as cheap , ii know i would may feel disastrous lately but its strange how i seen everyone at 70k and above saying "if we go below 60 I'm buying more " if we go below 50 I'm selling my house to buy more " my point being don't be that person who forget how they felt at overbought levels wishing they could get this beautiful chance to buy , ofc u might be thinking but why don't we wait for the golden fib zone from 16k to 75k which is roughly 30-40k area , my answer is simple , I've seen a nice opportunity and i don't want to miss it , for finance reasons and mental stress , as a wise man once said id rather be a bit early then a bit late from my analysis its very fair to say this could just rocket very very soon un expectedly and I'm not prepared to miss it.

Why am i so bullish and not neutral/scared ?
The reason I'm so bullish and not even worried yet is because in my views there's no concern at all to me until we pass all time highs again . some traders would say "no we have trapped bulls and were in a bear market "
My response being really ? u really think its the bulls who are trapped and not bears who will be trapped .. i would never even consider bull trap until 75k levels since id like to see similar to last bull runs price action. We hit around 64k hit extreme fear and greed and then shot back up to new all time highs to 69k , now while everyone's worried about who's trapped in a simple manor , we went down and people saw a buy opportunity as we all should, of course this is why I'm not even worried about being "trapped" till we make a clear Break of structure above 75k maybe once we done that it can be time to be cautious take some profits set stop looses whatever your ways are.

as you can see from my analysis i trust it all with fibs order blocks and gaps with trendlines and key levels to hold. you can see my very bullish arrow leading to 100k spring that of course is best case scenario as a rocket could appear , my not so bullish view is the other arrow path showing we could copy last bulls runs pa making a new high getting stuck at a my pitchfork / channel which would be around 80k which ofc is possible a lot of people may want to take partials and buyers get less interested there leading to end of bull market and start of bear market.

thankyou for taking your time to read my thoughts very much appreciated i hope i helped in some way :) feel free to message me , like , follow whatever as u please !

good luck traders
This idea is a long-term bull market scenario. This idea could start on the day of the FED interest rate decision. The rate decision could lead price action into a bear trap by making traders think we are making a lower low. Well, we do, but this should be considered a bear trap as we have been moving sideways since March and a big event like the FED rate decision could lead to a trend change. Considering the fact that we are making lower lows, it seems like we are constantly liquidating the long positions and the market makers are keeping the short positions alive to sell on a late uptrend.
I compare it to the chart of gold.  The timing is not correct.
BYBIT:BTCUSD.P  is supper bearish rigth now, + this is september another super bearish month for btc

my tp are on the chart, if you follow a trend trader like me you wont missout on trend 
were also short on some other ALTCOINS, updates and signal are given here also
Price has been consolidating for the last couple of days however looks like we'll be breaking down due to the head and shoulder formation. I'm looking to buy at 54k and dca if we hit 48k but 56.6 is a decent support so tp is there.
In the daily timeframe, BTC appears bearish. It failed to reach the resistance trendline and was rejected after hitting $65k. The price in the hourly timeframe shows some support, but without sufficient inflow, this support may not hold.

In this chart, BTC is caught between support and resistance, and given the current market scenario, the price is leaning more toward the bearish side. The support trendline around $52.5k will be crucial if BTC drops further.

Be cautious and do thorough research before investing. If you're using leverage, make sure to set a stop loss.

Trade safely.

Team Dexter.
Hi everybody, bulls are on BTC market. We have more then 1K contracts for purchase. Strong support level at 57900 and probably short term bulls target - 61000. So going upper in near time.
Everyone is turning very bullish, which is not good for the crypto market. With the upcoming bloody September, we have a strong confluence to sell Bitcoin with the current price of 63,800. Why are Bitcoin and whole crypto in a bear market? On the chart, we can see that the price is printing lower lows and lower highs, which is by definition a downtrend. It has been like this since March 2024, and nothing has changed since then. We can see that the price is inside this descending parallel channel on the daily chart. There are no signs of strength in higher timeframes! Bulls didn't prove their strength yet, so to me it looks like a bull trap, and we will see a 30% crash!

From the Elliott Wave perspective, we have an ABC correction so far, and it's too early to tell if this will turn into an impulse wave or not, but right now this is a corrective structure. The problem is that everyone is turning bullish again; everyone sees a huge bull market, but usually the market does the opposite.

Let me know what you think about my analysis in the comment section, and please hit boost and follow for more ideas. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach! Thank you, and I wish you successful trades.

Dear Colleagues and Traders. üòâ

In this post, I intend to share my analysis of the anticipated trajectory of Bitcoin, supported by both technical indicators and historical patterns.

 To begin, I anticipate that Bitcoin may experience a near-term rebound, which could be followed by a subsequent decline. 

Before we delve into the specific details of this analysis, I recommend reviewing my previous post, where I provided a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term outlook. This context will allow for a deeper understanding of the current market conditions.

 ‚¨áÔ∏èPrevious Post (Long-Term Perspective) 

If you have reviewed that analysis, we can now proceed to examine the three critical pieces of evidence that substantiate the forecast presented today.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 8H / Current / First Piece of Evidence 

This chart illustrates Bitcoin‚Äôs movements from June 7, 2024, to August 5, 2024, within a clearly defined descending channel.

Bitcoin remains constrained within this channel, with no breakout having occurred thus far.

 The reliability of this channel is noteworthy. 

This reliability is particularly evident when we examine the midline, which has acted as both support and resistance on five occasions, thereby reinforcing the channel's structural integrity.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Past Example 1 

This chart, covering the period from April 14, 2023, to May 23, 2023, similarly displays a descending channel.

During this time, the price consistently encountered support and resistance at the midline before ultimately breaking out to the upside.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Past Example 2 

Another example can be observed from January 11, 2024, to January 21, 2024.

This channel, although formed over a shorter timeframe, also demonstrated a similar pattern, with the price finding support at the midline before eventually breaking out upward.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 1H / Past Example 3 

In this example, spanning from March 30, 2023, to April 5, 2023, we observe a comparable pattern.

The midline provided robust support, and the price consistently failed to close below it, further solidifying the channel‚Äôs credibility.

This setup also culminated in an upward breakout.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 8H / Current 

Returning to the current chart, with the benefit of historical data, it becomes increasingly feasible to predict the future trajectory of Bitcoin's price.

 If the current descending channel maintains its integrity, a rebound, supported by the midline, appears likely. 

‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Second Piece of Evidence 

The second key piece of evidence involves the RSI indicator on the 4-hour chart, where a  "Hidden Bullish Divergence"  is emerging.

In this scenario, the price is forming a higher low on the right side of the chart compared to the left, while the RSI is creating a lower low.

This formation, known as a  "Hidden Bullish Divergence,"  often precedes an upward movement in price. Let us consider some historical examples.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Past Example 1 

In this chart, dated around March 30, 2024, we observe a higher low in price on the right, accompanied by a lower RSI, indicative of a "Hidden Bullish Divergence."

This setup led to a price increase of approximately 13%.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Past Example 2 

Another instance, from October 2, 2023, presents a similar pattern: a higher low in price with a lower low in RSI, signaling a  "Hidden Bullish Divergence." 

Following this formation,  Bitcoin experienced a surge of approximately 114%,  reaching a new all-time high.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Past Example 3 

This example from June 25, 2024, also shows a higher low in price coupled with a lower low in RSI, confirming a  "Hidden Bullish Divergence." 

 This setup resulted in a price increase of around 9%. 

Now, let us return to the current chart.


 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Current 

With these past examples in mind, it is evident that a "Hidden Bullish Divergence" is also forming in the current chart.

Should this pattern hold, we can reasonably expect an upward movement in Bitcoin‚Äôs price.

‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏èBTCUSDT.P / BINANCE / 4H / Third Piece of Evidence 

The final piece of evidence derives from Elliott Wave Theory, a concept that may appear complex but can be simplified.


Following a low of $48,888, Bitcoin completed an upward wave, peaking at $65,737.2. We are currently in the corrective phase of this wave.


This correction appears to be unfolding in the form of a  "Flat"  pattern, comprising three waves.
The final wave in this  "Flat"  pattern should ideally manifest as an impulsive wave.
At present, the chart suggests that an  "Ending Diagonal"  pattern is the most probable scenario, which could indicate a forthcoming rebound.


It is imperative to note that if the price breaches the current low, the  "Flat"  pattern will be invalidated. However, until such a breach occurs, a strategy of buying on dips remains rational.

‚Äî

 
 In summary, here is a recap of the evidence supporting today‚Äôs analysis: 

‚¨áÔ∏è First Piece of Evidence: Descending Channel

The price is currently finding support at the midline of the descending channel.

 Should this support hold, a significant rebound could ensue. 


‚¨áÔ∏è Second Piece of Evidence: Hidden Bullish Divergence

The price is forming a higher low, while the RSI is forming a lower low.

 Historically, such "Hidden Bullish Divergences" have often preceded upward price movements. 


‚¨áÔ∏è Third Piece of Evidence: Elliott Wave Theory

We are currently in the corrective phase of an upward wave, likely forming a  "Flat"  pattern, with an  "Ending Diagonal"  scenario suggesting a potential rebound.

‚Äî

 
In conclusion, based on today‚Äôs analysis, here is my trading strategy:


 I have set a stop-loss at the $55,969 level and plan to accumulate Bitcoin on dips from this point forward. 

The risk-reward ratio is highly favorable, and the stop-loss level is clearly defined, making this a prudent and strategic approach.

This concludes today‚Äôs analysis. I appreciate your time and attention in reviewing this detailed post.

Should you find it insightful, your support through a boost and a follow would be greatly appreciated.

 The More Traders Are Knowledgeable, The More the Game Becomes Tough 

 More People Jump into the Crypto Space 
In today's world, more and more people are becoming interested in investing in financial markets. Social media influencers frequently encourage their followers to invest, presenting it as a path to  financial freedom . While trading in the stock market requires a significant amount of capital and a deep understanding of a company's financial system, many people are turning to the crypto space instead. The barriers to entry in crypto are lower, and the market is known for its high volatility, which attracts people looking for quick profits.

 Crypto Is Not the Same as Before 
In the early days of crypto, making money seemed much easier, especially during bull markets and altseasons. Back then, there were only a  few popular coins , and traders could make massive profits in just a few weeks. Many new traders today look at historical charts and expect the same kind of gains, hoping their chosen coins will follow the same patterns.

However, today‚Äôs market participants are far more knowledgeable than before. There are countless free courses online, helping people learn about bull and bear markets, support and resistance levels, volume trading, and moving averages. Traders now understand these concepts well and are aware of the different market phases. They know not to buy at the peak and to try to buy at the bottom.

 Despite All the Knowledge, 90% of Market Participants Still Lose Money 
Even with all this knowledge about technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and money management, most traders still lose money. The key reason is that crypto is not just about numbers;  it‚Äôs an emotional game. 

The idea of  "buy low, sell high"  is easier said than done. When prices are low, bad news and fear often dominate, leading traders to think,  "I'll wait for a bigger drop"  or  "This coin might go to zero" . On the other hand, when prices are high, people rush to buy, fearing they‚Äôll miss out on the gains, thinking the coin has already validated its low.
Even if someone buys at a low point, they might hold on too long, saying things like,  "There's strong buying power; let's hold"  or  "I‚Äôll wait for the first signs of a decline" . But coins often don‚Äôt give clear warning signs before they start dropping. Many traders find themselves regretting not selling at 10x gains and end up with just a 10% profit or even a loss. As prices dip below their entry point, emotions like regret, shame, and frustration set in. Statements like  "I‚Äôll hold for the long run"  are common, but most end up selling at a 50% loss because they need liquidity for other opportunities.

 Why Has the Game Become Tough? 
The answer to this question will be revealed in the next episode. Stay tuned !

BTCUSDT took out the sell-side liquidity all am expecting to see happen is for price to revisit 56k that's a liquidity sweep around that zone for a buying opportunity entry for now i might consider swinging sell to that zone........
we are going down soon:( one more push before the downhill )
BTC.Day chart. 09 may be a little bearish..... But after 09.20 it will continue to grow and it is possible to make another ATH around 11-12.
Small update on my BTC plans here!

We are currently following the yellow path from the two previous updates. BTC is not showing any strength here so far, so I'm being patient and will look for the 55k lows to get taken out.

In the meantime I can scalp a bit in this range; I might even get lucky and catch a scalp entry that I can partially turn into a longer term play, but we'll see.

We left some nPoCs above us that are interesting to keep an eye on. Especially the volume + time npoc around the green box are important.

Bulls want to reclaim that green GP box that would also take us back above the current mtf consolidation range (green path).

Bears would probably be looking to short the bearish retest of that box. From there I'd take profit at 57k IF current lows remain unswept (blue path).

If we take the 57.5 lows first, then get to green GP box, but then back to 57.5, that's really not looking good and you would hold shorts for much lower;
Reasoning is that if these lows remain untaken, price actually has a reason to come back down. If the lows get taken but then after bullish structure visited again, there is no reason for price to do that other than structural weakness.

Hope that makes sense somehow. Feel free to reach out in the comments if not!
Hi traders,

Last week Bitcoin dropped from 65K, making a bigger correction down.

So for next week we could see more downside for this pair.

Let's see what the market does and react.

Trade idea: Wait for a small correction up on a lower timeframe and trade shorts.

If you want to learn more about my analysis, please make sure to follow me, give a like and respectful comment.

This shared post is only my point of view on what could be the next move in this pair based on my analysis. I do not provide signals.

Don't be emotional, just trade!

Eduwave
in next 2 month BTC will break the ascending triangle and point the new ATH between 95k and 115k , also the cup pattern showed in weekly time frame.
BTC is in a zone between 64.7 and 57.6 and has fallen about 12% in a few days.
Currently the price is below VRVP POC and below premium buy zone,
 as well as the pattern at the bottom.
Volume narrows, so does Volume delta.
at this time, we need to wait for confirmation in which direction the price will go.
If it rises to VRVP POC (59.238), premium buy zone must pass,
pass the tunnel pattern 50% AND rebound to Fib 0.618.
If it falls, it will be up to 57k, because there is no sign of an uptrend yet
Possible reversal from here indicated by bullish candle formations and oscillator. 

Trying this hoping for 2R.

Good luck.
Hello traders, I want to share an update on Bitcoin with you. Looking at the chart, we can see how the price some time ago fell to the support line, breaking the support level, which coincided with the buyer zone, but at once rebounded up to the resistance level. Then BTC some time traded near this level and later it made a correction movement to the support line, which coincided with the 56600 support level and then started to grow. In a short time, the price rose to the resistance level, broke it, and even rose a little higher than the seller zone, but then it turned around and started to decline inside a downward wedge. Inside the wedge, BTC quickly fell to the 61700 level, broke it one more time, and then dropped to the support line of the wedge, breaking the support line. Next, the price bounced from the support line of the wedge and rose to the resistance line, after which turned around and continued to decline near this line. At the moment, the price trades near this line and I think Bitcoin can fall a little more in a wedge and then start to grow. Price can leave a wedge pattern and continue to grow to the 61700 resistance level, which is my TP. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ
First, I need to apologize for the confusion and misunderstanding. The most common question that keeps on arising is, "Why the force?", "Why should Bitcoin drop so strongly?"

The mistake is mine and obviously made in the terms being used. At one point, we started to call it a drop, a move down, a correction, a classic correction, strong correction, standard correction, etc. And normally people would reply pointing out the distinct support levels, as they should. But the problem is that we are not looking at a correction, we are looking at capitulation.

I looked up the definition for capitulation and this is what came up:

 "Capitulation refers to a situation in which investors/traders liquidate their existing long stock position during an extended stock price decline. It can be viewed as the moment in which investors/traders lose hope in their long position and accept losses." 

When you look at it from this point of view, this is the reason why there is no reason to talk about or consider any support. The floor just breaks down. People are not looking to sell or buy, to trade; a bullish or bearish wave; it is a change in mentality, a definite action taken by a large section of the market, those that have been holding for almost six months. Maybe it is 100% psychological I don't know, because capitulation tends to happens after six months.

On the 14th of September, it will be exactly six months since Bitcoin stopped experiencing growth.


‚û¢  Altcoins Market Update 

We are now focused, bullishly, on the altcoins vs bitcoin pairs and I have good news. These pairs continue to do good and continue bullish. We have the initial bullish breakout on many and the retrace, for all of them, is ending in a classic higher low.

The way things are developing, the charts and price action, fully indicates that this is the much awaited altcoins season. This is to say, that these pairs are set to grow between 3-6 months. Some will grow between 6-12 months and some will grow for an even longer period of time. This is counting since their last major low.

Most of these pairs, which we have been looking at recently, hit bottom early August. Some hit bottom in April, June and July but these are the exception; the majority in August, it makes no difference.

Our attention is going back again to the altcoins and we will let Bitcoin do its thing.

Patience is key. We will see the money that is withdrawn from Bitcoin going to these altcoins through ALTS-BTC.

The other pairs can also grow, some of them.
The USDT pairings are risky right now and each chart needs to be considered individually.

I can only speak for the charts/pairs that I am looking at individually because there are thousands and thousands of altcoins now. Some are bearish, some are bullish, some are neutral.

Whatever will happen with Bitcoin the market will let us know (an easy guess), but we know that the altcoins (BTC pairings) are going up!

Namaste.

BTCUSDT is actively trading in a RANGE.

It is recommended to stay out of trading ranges as the unpredictability is high in ranges, as it's ACCUMULATING for sharp high volume move.

The plan of action is one of PATIENCE, if you enter too early it's not a strategy it's a GUESS, and we do not do that around here. 

PATIENTLY wait for a breakout either buy side or short side and tailor your entry based on how the market reacts.
"Bitcoin is currently in a strong uptrend, consolidating within a descending broadening wedge. This pattern is consistent with BTC's historical behavior, where the cryptocurrency often consolidates after a strong rally. As seen in previous instances, a successful breakout from this consolidation phase typically leads to a robust bullish wave.

Based on this chart pattern and BTC's historical data, it's likely that Bitcoin will easily surpass $100,000 after a successful breakout. The current consolidation phase is a normal market behavior, and the impending breakout could catalyze a significant price surge keep eyes on btc for breakout
My dear friend and fellow trader, I am writing to you today with great joy and pleasure.

We are currently looking at what can only be described as the most interesting, intriguing, and surprising technology of our time. This is the chart for Bitcoin.

1) Since March, BTC has been experience lower highs, as well as lower lows.
2) Since March, the highest volume in a single session has resulted in major selling.
3) Since March, there has been strong selling pressure each time Bitcoin tried to move up, and 70K became a major barrier in late July while 65K ended as the latest lower high.
i hope you like it its time to buy long.....


im not a pro trader guys. but this is for my own research....

#Bitcoin Update on Sunday 01.09.2024
A.O.A and Good Morning to All Brothers and Sisters.

#Bitcoin continues moving in the same place, up and down. The price tried to break the support (Arrow #4) without success, and as long as the price remains above that line, for me, it is still not in a downtrend. But as I said in my last analysis, #Bitcoin tries to bring on limits to traders. That's why it's moving in the same place and consolidating well.

What's Next?
As we have very low volume on weekends and the movement of #Bitcoin is not patent, I suggest waiting until Monday evening to see the final direction of Bitcoin.

#ALTS

#ALTS remain the same. There's a lot of dumping with #Bitcoin's bearish movement, and they suffer a lot. My suggestions remain the same for #ALTS: no new trades before Monday. Tighten your stop losses. If you are in profit, move your stop losses to breakeven, and be patient.

I wish you all a very nice weekend.
My dear friends... We are going back to basics one last time and this time we will look at the MACD and RSI.

We are going to look at both indicators on the daily and weekly timeframe.
We are going to stay 100% out of the way, no opinions. We will read the indicators and translate them based on common knowledge.

Are you ready? Great!
Let's get started.

Make sure to boost if you enjoy the content, and consider hitting "follow" if you want to see more.


‚û¢  Bitcoin Basics | MACD 

We start with the weekly timeframe. This is Bitcoin's weekly MACD: 

The MACD is on the "bullish zone," which simply means that it is above zero. The fact that it is clearly moving lower while trending down is considered bearish. The "trending down" is the most important part.

The histogram is red which means that a bearish cross is already in place. The bearish cross happened 29-April 2024. When the MACD crosses the signal line with a downward bias.

Clear enough? Great!
Let's move on.

Bitcoin's daily MACD: 

Here we can see the MACD on the "bearish zone," which simply means that it is below the zero line. The bearish cross here is also present; red histogram. It is also trending down, so the whole picture here is 100% bearish.

So far so good... Give me more!


‚û¢  Bitcoin Basics | RSI 

The same dynamic with the RSI. We start with the longer timeframe, weekly, and then move to the shorter timeframe, daily.

This is Bitcoin's weekly RSI: 

This one is a little bit more interesting for learning purposes. 

The reading is 48, which is bearish (below 50 is bearish).
It is trading below an important fib. level (bearish).
Trending down.

This being the weekly timeframe, these are strong bearish signals.
The weekly RSI is 100% bearish, currently. Things can change but this is how it is looking now. Pure TA. No opinion.

Bitcoin's daily RSI: 

The daily RSI peaked January 2023 (not shown), so there is a long-term bearish divergence with this one.

The reading is 43, bearish. Trending down, bearish.
Not much to see here... The indicator simply confirms everything we can gather by looking at the candles and other indicators.


‚û¢  Conclusion 

The oscillators, MACD and RSI, are both bearish on the daily and weekly timeframes.

I hope you find this information useful.

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.
After the last fall, you entered the zone of interest. Now, we are likely to go to the white box, from which we will see the final movement down and the subsequent impulse with the renewal of new tops or without dipping into the zone of 54-56k.

I look at the market extremely positively.
-Because everything is down right now -

Altcoins
-We've held the Bitcoin level.
-In a few days, it's September.
-Markets rise on fear.

CRYPTOCAP:BTC  bulls be very cautious here!

Bear case:
1.  AMEX:SPY  breadth running out of steem
2.  AMEX:SPY  seasonal weakness in September
3.  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  is below 20 W EMA, 50/200 D MA bearish cross
4.  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  Weekly close below the ichimoku cloud.

Still possible for a 70k retest at trendline, but Bear case outweighs the bull base
Hello Followers,

I have come across a beautiful pattern of Cup&Handle made by this coin. I do my analysis on crypto during the the weekend because rest of the markets are closed. I was doing my analysis on BTCUSDT on Daily and Hourly time frames and when I switched to Weekly time frame, it took me no time to realise the pattern formed over the last few years (Nov 2021 - Sept 2024). So, the projection of C&H pattern is also plotted which can be harnessed for monumental gains. In 4H time frame, the chart is making a bullish flag whose projection is nearly 3/4 of the projection of Cup & Handle pattern. Last but not the least, if these two pattern played well then the gains are unimaginable (but don't be greedy). I have put my pending orders of Buy Stop on 1D time frame with four TPs with still capacity of adding a few more extra targets.

The Signal is:
EP: 71265.60
SL: 48195.18
TP1: 94336.20
TP2: 117406.44
TP3: 140476.86
TP4: 163547.28

Considering a Short-Term Long Trade on Bitcoin: Target ‚Äî 60,180 USD

I am currently planning to open a short-term long position on Bitcoin with a target of 60,180 USD. The entry will be made after retail traders‚Äô stop orders have been collected at the support level. This will provide additional confirmation of the strength of the level and the potential for a reversal.

Overall Market Situation

As I mentioned in my previous idea, Bitcoin still holds a bearish sentiment overall. However, even in a downtrend, there are opportunities for short-term long positions. I recommend checking out my previous idea in my profile for a more comprehensive understanding of the current market situation.

Your Opinion Matters

Don‚Äôt forget to leave a comment and give a like if you find this idea interesting. Your feedback and opinions are always valuable to me!
It is expected that by collecting the liquidity of the buying side, we must now wait for the collection of the selling side.
TLDR:  
My bias remains bearish. According to my analysis, Bitcoin is in a complex WXYXZ correction. Ultimately, this correction will lead Bitcoin to lower prices of as low as 45K, possibly lower. 
However, all hope is not lost for the bulls. The possibility of a bullish continuation exists under the following conditions:
1. Bitcoin must make an HH above 65K. 
2. The correction period will not exceed beyond December 2024.
3. The price must stay above 49K. 

  

 High Probability Scenario for September 1st ‚Äì 7th. 
I expect Bitcoin to dip into the daily demand zone (54K-56K). This will end Wave A, and a bullish reaction will follow in Wave B. 
 Trade Idea:  
Entry: 56K 
SL: below 54K
Target: 62.5K. 
R: R: 1:3.3
Don‚Äôt set a limit order. Follow the PA. Price can reverse slightly above 56K or further into the demand zone.

  

 Low Probability Scenario for September 1st ‚Äì 7th. 
Bitcoin continues to make an HH, completing wave 1 of 5. 
 Trade Idea:  
Entry: 66K
SL: 67.3K
TP1 58K, TP2, 55K
R: R to first TP is 1:6

  

 Is a 100K Bitcoin Still Possible? 
Bitcoin‚Äôs wave 3 top was 73.777K on March 13th, 2024. Since making the ATH, Bitcoin has been in a wave 4 correction. As far as the criteria for invalidation are concerned, a continuation in wave 5 is still possible. 
A continuation in Wave 5 is possible as long as:
1. Price: The price doesn‚Äôt close a weekly candle below the 0.618 retracement at 43.5K. 
2. Time: Theoretically, wave 4 can last 300% longer than wave 3 and is still considered valid. However, this is a textbook definition, and I think it‚Äôs senseless. Between 1 and 1.618, fib time is realistic. According to this criterion, Bitcoin must enter wave 5 territory between September 9th and December 30th. 
You must understand that the longer Bitcoin stays in a correction, the bigger the chances of the macro headwinds catching up with Bitcoin and cutting any bullish continuation at the knees. 
China is already experiencing a recession, or, at the least, an economic slowdown coupled with deflation. So is the EU and the U.S. 
I don‚Äôt want to go into the details of each Zone‚Äôs economic performance, but if you are economically savvy, you already know the score. 
As I see it, Bitcoin must begin wave 5 no later than October 2024; otherwise, it will be too late. 
Also, for a realistic chance at 100K per Bitcoin, 49K must be the lowest price. 

  

 100K Bitcoin Roadmap:  
From a macro view, we must assume that 49K was the lowest point in a WXY complex correction and that Bitcoin is already at the initial stage of wave 5. 

  

 Wave 5 Roadmap: 
For a realistic chance of continuation in wave 5, we must assume that 49K was the end of a complex WXY correction in wave 4.
Also, Bitcoin must make an HH in wave 1 of 5 as early as next week!
After making an HH in wave 1, Bitcoin must retrace in wave 2, no lower than 0.786 retracement at 52.8K. Bitcoin can then push higher in wave 3 to the 1.618 extension at 81K. Retrace in wave 4 to 70K and push higher between 90K and 100K in wave 5. 
For this scenario to be realistic, Bitcoin must make an HH to around 66K next week‚Äîit then needs to hold above 53K in the wave 2 retracement. Without an HH or if it falls below 53K, the chances of continuation in wave 5 will significantly diminish. 

  

 Gann Support to EW analysis: 
Pulling a Gann fan from the bottom of Wave 1 to the top of Wave 3 on a squared chart supports the EW analysis. 
From a Gann standpoint, the current support level for Bitcoin is the 2/1 angle at 55K. If Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt close a weekly candle below 55K, it is good for continuation. Lose 55K, and it will continue lower. 

  

 Daily Chart Analysis 
The daily chart analysis remains almost the same as the previous weeks. 
58K is the most significant support level on the daily TF. 
If Bitcoin loses the 58K support without making an HH first, it will open Bitcoin to a bearish continuation. Initially, to fill the wicks on weekly and daily TFs but ultimately to 45K and possibly lower. 
The primary bias remains short. 
As Bitcoin continues to chop around the 200D EMA with low volatility, I am not interested in trading micro moves. If you intend to trade Bitcoin long, look for a break above the 200D EMA and a retest. 

  

Best wishes
