The only reason why people liked Bitcoin is that it went exponentially up from 2009 to 2017 and made a lot of new millionaires. The price in 2017 was 20,000 USD per Bitcoin, the current price is 58,900, and I predict Bitcoin to hit 28k next year! So after 8 years of struggling, bitcoin is going nowhere. The soon you understand the fact that Bitcoin will never go exponentially up again, you will start making money. And really forget about altcoins, I predict ETH to hit 700 USD next year as well. Why is that? Why is crypto dead, and will it recover?

The answer is no, it will not recover. The reason is that the overall hype ended and the bubble really popped. New scientific research shows that this crypto technology is actually even worse than the FED's fiat model of unbacked currencies with their money printer. And yes, all central banks in the world belong to the FED. With this technology, they can make a one-world digital currency (Bitcoin - CBDC) with a total control model. Every transaction is tracked on the blockchain, 1 wallet per person, public wallet blacklists, maximum spendings, etc. If FED introduces you to a new currency called Bitcoin, you will probably dislike it immediately, so what about create Bitcoin secretly?¬†

This crypto technology is not new at all, it was brought to earth by weird alien races from other star systems and galaxies. They cooperate with FED and the unfriendly Galactic Federation for a long time.

A lot of people still think that Bitcoin is here to destroy banks. This is completely false, banks do not really care what currency they use. The main purpose of banks is to provide financial services and to keep your money saved. Yes, you can go to banks and get a loan, you will get 100,000 USD, but you need to pay 200,000 USD. That's a good business, isn't it? And it really doesn't matter if the loan is in US dollars, Bitcoins, gold, or silver. Banks provide over 100 different services, and they make money on them. So no, Bitcoin has nothing to do with destroying banks! Bitcoin is really not good as presented, it's the opposite.

Btw, the real story behind the Titanic Boat is to get rid of people who were against the creation of the FED. They were unable to create the federal reserve system because they did not have enough votes. Rothschilds and J.P. Morgan built the "unsincable" Titanic and invited the most influential people so they could get rid of them in the middle of the ocean. They killed over 1500 powerful people, and it was on 15 April 1912. The FED was created afterwards on 23. December 1913.

My fellow traders, here we have a classic bearish chart setup.

‚ûñ Bitcoin has been consolidation with a bearish bias now for six months straight; it has been printing lower highs.

‚ûñ Volume has been dominant on the bearish side and the BTC side of the Altcoins market is decidedly bullish. These signals are telling us that Bitcoin is likely to move down next; another leg down.

‚ûñ This move can develop within the next 3-14 days, thus making this a timing trade. Potentially, a "great entry timing."

I am wishing you profits and good luck.

Hello Traders! 
What are your thoughts on BITCOIN ?
Bitcoin has been in an upward trend in recent days, showing significant strength. However, the price is now approaching a key resistance zone that could potentially lead to a temporary correction.
Given this resistance, we anticipate a correction in this area. This correction could present an opportunity for traders to enter the market.
It is recommended that traders closely monitor this resistance zone and wait for the correction to complete before considering entry. Once the correction is over, we expect Bitcoin to resume its upward movement and potentially reach new highs.

If you found this analysis helpful, don‚Äôt forget to like and share your thoughts in the comments! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Bitcoin  is currently moving in the  Support zone($55,780-$54,550)  near the  Support lines  and  100_SMA(4H-TF) .

According to  Elliott's wave theory , Bitcoin is completing  microwave 5 of the main wave 5 .

Also,  Regular Divergence (RD+)  between  Consecutive Valleys .

I expect  Bitcoin  to rise to at least  $59,000  after breaking the  Resistance line .

 Note: We can expect more dumps if Bitcoin breaks the Support zone($55,780-$54,550).

Bitcoin has been going sideways for more than 6 months, but this should end! On the chart, we can see a bullish flag, and the price action in recent days dramatically increased the probability of a bullish breakout! Even though I was bearish pretty much since May (72,000 USD) until now, this recent price action changed my mind to switch to a full bullish mod. I was right about the previous downtrends, but let's focus on recent data.

From the Elliott Wave perspective, we are starting another strong impulse wave (5). It looks like the sideways price action (wave (4)) is a very complex WXYXZ triple-three corrective pattern. On the chart, you can see the whole price action of this bullish cycle from 15476 USD. From a time perspective, it makes sense as the timeframe is pretty much the same as wave (2).

What is the target? We need to take the Fibonacci extension tool and look for the 0.382, 0.618, 1.000, 1.382 or 1.618. Waves (5) always measure from the begging on the uptrend to the end of wave (4). I estimated the target for around 130,000 USD. Also consider using LOG scale + linear scale together.

Bitcoin also reacted very positively to the decreasing interest rates at the FED's recent meeting on September 18. That is also something we need to consider. Let me know what you think about my analysis in the comment section, and please hit boost and follow for more ideas. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach! Thank you, and I wish you successful trades.

BINANCE:BTCUSDT  is strengthening after a false breakdown of the 54.5K - 55K support. Fundamentally and technically, there is no buyer motivation. Traders have moved into the waiting or selling phase...

  

Now BTC is accumulated mainly by wallets with balance < 1BTC... Larger wallets are not doing much. Also, judging by the statistics of various services it can be seen that the trading activity of large investors has decreased, and whales have stopped actively accumulating since August. Traders doubt the current rebound in BTC and continue to actively short it.
Technically, the coin shows negative, bearish dynamics, forming gradually declining highs without the possibility to approach the retest of local peaks.
For the last one and a half or two months a tight sideways range has been formed and MM continues to keep the price inside the flat, it is also worth paying attention to the descending resistance, which also prevents the market from going up, putting pressure together with SMA-200.

 Resistance Levels: SMA200, 59600, Trend Line
Support levels: 57736, 56K, 54500 

At the moment the price is consolidating in the bullish zone, which indicates a possible chance to rise to 59600. The situation may end with a short-squeeze and further decline after liquidity capture. The pressure from sellers continues and buyers are not ready yet

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:BTCUSD   ;)

Bitcoin  moved as I expected in  yesterday's post .

 Bitcoin  is currently moving in the  Resistance zone($60,080-$59,400) , near the  Resistance lines  and the  50_SMA(Daily) .

It also seems that  Bitcoin  can potentially form the  Bearish Crab Harmonic Pattern  and  Bearish Shark Harmonic Pattern .

After breaking the  small   Support zone , I expect  Bitcoin to attack  the  Support zone($58,000-$56,600)  again.

 Note: We can expect more pumps if Bitcoin breaks the Resistance line (over $61,000).

‚û°Ô∏èBitcoin is heading for a massive bear market in 2024/2025! If you are new to crypto, you may miss information about usual Bitcoin volatility; precisely, Bitcoin crashes by 80% - 90% every 3rd year. Of course this is not natural, it's caused by tremendous manipulation by Cabal (banks, governments, world's organizations (WEF, WHO, etc...). They all work together while giving you an illusion. Of course their goal is to enslave humans with nanotechnologies, artificial intelligence, a neurolink from Elon Musk (that will be connected to your brain), a credit score system, and 1 world digital currency (Bitcoin), forced jabs, etc... All these technologies are completely incompatible with the human body and cause massive depression, anxiety and cancer. In today's world, we can already see how many people are in a depression state by these technologies.

‚û°Ô∏èThey will not tell you that every human naturally possesses strong abilities, such as Telekinesis (move objects with your mind) or Telepathy (you don't really need to use your phone to communicate over long distances). There are natural abilities that every human can do without exception. And I don't want to talk about magic powers, leaving your physical body during sleep (astral travel) or meditation, maybe in the next post. These are abilities the Cabal doesn't want you to use.

‚û°Ô∏èOn the weekly chart, we can see that Bitcoin is heading downward, I expect 28k to be hit in 2025. Of course markets move in waves, and we have many minor levels on the way down. We have the 100 and 200 weekly moving averages at the same place, 0.382 FIB retracement, fair value gaps, and 0.618 FIB retracement. I will keep you updated once we reach these important levels!

Good afternoon my fellow supporter, readers, followers and Cryptocurrency traders, how are you feeling in this wonderful day?

We are going to look at a classic now, everybody on TradingView knows this one; MA200.

‚ûñ When Bitcoin, or any Cryptocurrency for that matter, trades below MA200 on the daily timeframe we consider this bearish long-term.

‚ûñ When the trading is happening above this level, it is considered bullish.

‚ûñ Bitcoin is currently trading below MA200 on the daily timeframe.

‚ûñ MA200 sits right now at exactly $64,000.
‚ûñ Any trading below this level indicates that a long-term bearish bias is in place.

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.

Bitcoin  started  pumping  after the announcement of the  US Federal Funds Rate  ( The Federal Reserve lowered the US Federal Funds Rate by 0.5% to 5.00%. ).

 Considering that lowering Funds Rate is potentially good for the cryptocurrency market, lowering Funds Rate while the US government continues to print and spend money is a big mistake. I predict that investors may prefer bonds to riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies as interest rates fall. 

 Bitcoin  is currently moving in the  Resistance zone($63,500-$61,460) ,  Potential Reversal Zone(PRZ) , near the  21_SMA(Weekly)  and  200_SMA(Daily) ,  Yearly Resistance(3)  and  upper lines of the Ascending Channel .

According to the theory of  Elliott waves , Bitcoin seems to have succeeded in completing the  Zigzag correction(ABC/5-3-5) .

Also,  Regular Divergence (RD-)  between  Consecutive Peaks .

Before drawing a better conclusion, let's take a look at the  USDT.D%  and  BTC.D%  charts.

 USDT.D%  is moving near the  Support zone , the lower line of the  Descending Channel  and the  Potential Reversal Zone(PRZ) . I expect  USDT.D%  to rise at least to the  Resistance zone  again,  bringing down the Bitcoin price .üëá

BTC.D% is moving in a Heavy Resistance zone. According to  Elliott's wave theory ,  BTC.D%  seems to be completing the  main wave 5  with the  Ending Diagonal . I expect  BTC.D%  to start its downward trend soon,  which could cause Bitcoin to fall more than other tokens .üëá


Based on the above explanation, I expect  Bitcoin  to at least drop to the  Support zone($60,000-$59,100)  and  Support lines  and  fill the CME Gaps .

 Note: If Bitcoin can break the Resistance zone($63,500-$61,460), we should expect Bitcoin to rise to at least $65,000.

Bitcoin remains in consolidation within a strong descending broadening wedge, recently reaching the wedge bottom as corrective wave leg E completed. 

This signals the potential for a massive impulsive move, making the current buy-back zone ideal for re-accumulation if the opportunity arises. A strong reaction is expected at the external supply zone, but we anticipate a breakout. 

Previous analysis has shown how well price has adhered to this pattern. The road map show it all clearly.


 Let us know if you're feeling bullish or bearish about this setup.

hello guys.

 Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern:  The chart highlights a clear Inverse Head and Shoulders formation, a well-known bullish reversal pattern. The left shoulder, head, and right shoulder are well-defined, signaling a potential trend reversal from the previous downtrend.

 Breakout Above the Neckline:  The price has broken above the neckline, which confirms the reversal pattern. This is typically a strong bullish signal indicating further upward momentum.

 Engulfing Pattern:  An Engulfing pattern at the right shoulder supports the bullish case, suggesting the buyers are gaining control, pushing the price higher.

 Next Target: The projected target for this breakout is $62,000, which is indicated on the chart. This would be the next key resistance level where traders might take profits or reassess positions. 
 
Pullback Potential:  There is also a possibility of a minor pullback to retest the breakout area (around $58,500), which would act as support before continuing upward.

BINANCE:BTCUSDT  
  Bitcoin price is in the ascending Triangle with means the bitcoin price can react to this situation and breaks the triangle and will go up. and the most important resistance for Btc is currently 61k if the price breaks this resistance, Bitcoin can reach the top of the megaphone. 

 Analysis Summary: 
Current Situation:
Bitcoin is struggling to break the important $61,000 level. This level is crucial for further upward movement.
 Potential Scenarios: 
If Bitcoin successfully surpasses the $61,000 level, it could indicate a bullish trend continuation.
Failure to break this level might lead to a consolidation phase or a potential bearish reversal, especially if it falls below the support level at $51K.
Conclusion:
The chart combines multiple technical analysis tools to provide a comprehensive view of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential price movements. Traders will be watching the $61,000 level closely, as breaking it could signal a strong bullish trend, while failing to do so might lead to a bearish scenario.

Another support level is lost in the form of EMA34 on the weekly timeframe...

Good Monday my dear reader, how are you feeling today?
Tomorrow we will have really high energy with a super full-Moon; will this be the trigger for the crash?

Bitcoin has been in a downtrend for six months now, fully confirmed and no signs of this pattern ending, in fact, it is being reinforced.

This week starts red and starting red after a weak pull-back is bad news.

What needs to happen for this chart to change from bearish to bullish?
That's irrelevant.

The fact is that Bitcoin is bearish now and moving lower.
It will turn bullish when it turns bullish, at that time we will consider the bullish signals.

For now, focus on the prize, focus on the goal; adapt to market conditions, remove the blinders, don't let assumptions get the best of you, the crash is closer than ever before.

I belief it will be a flash crash... But, who knows!

I don't know if it will flash crash or slow crash, but it is going down and we have some reckoning to do before we can consider bullish growth.

Remember, recovery in late 2024; slow in early 2025 (January-February) and bullish speed in March 2025 and beyond.

Patience is key.

Let the market do its thing.

Everything is good with life.

There are many opportunities around and many Altcoins are good now to support you while Bitcoin goes through its reset.

It might be "painful" short-term, only if you are not prepared.
But long-term, this is good news... We use these challenging moments to become stronger, to grow and evolve; challenges are the stepping stones to success.

You are a Diving living Soul.
You have eternal life.
You are special.

BTC Confirms a Double Top Pattern! What‚Äôs Next?

Bitcoin has recently formed a small double top pattern. The price has already broken down from the neckline, confirming a further decline.

Speculation is high regarding the upcoming FOMC meeting and the potential rate cut they might announce. However, BTC has remained indifferent to these speculations and hasn‚Äôt shown any significant rise in recent days. If this situation persists, BTC may continue to move downwards.

Should this trend continue, BTC could potentially drop further, possibly reaching the  GETTEX:54K  level.

 You may find more details in the chart!

hello guys

as I said before:


The chart shows a completed inverse head and shoulders pattern, signaling a bullish reversal.

Price broke above the yellow resistance zone, confirming the bullish breakout.

Next target is near 62,300 USDT, as shown by the horizontal resistance.

Price is currently consolidating within a reachable area (yellow zone), potentially retesting the breakout level.

Expect an upward continuation if the price holds above the support zone, with a strong chance of reaching the next target.

A failure to hold this zone could result in a retracement back to the QML (Quasimodo level).

In this analysis I want to take a look at BTC's short-term price action: what can we expect over the next few days?

As seen on the chart, the price is currently slightly reversing from the diagonal purple resistance. It's too early to call for a reversal, but we have to be cautious nevertheless.

On the bottom you can see the RSI indicator flashing overbought. The previous 2 times this occurred it caused a reversal.

This is exactly the same as today: RSI overbought and hitting resistance. This is not a time to be bullish. I'd wait for the price to pierce through the resistance. For aggressive bears, however, this seems like a perfect bearish swing-trade.

Massive 6% move up today for Bitcoin in anticipation for a 50 bps rate cut tomorrow.

 CRYPTOCAP:BTC  smashed through the 50D MA and back into the BMSB.

However don‚Äôt be fooled; we are still very much in a downtrend as you see the 50MA is well below the 200MA.

We could see price break through the BMSB and reject from the 200MA in the next 48 hours.

There‚Äôs still a lot of liquidity <$50k that needs to be claimed for the next leg up. 

Either way, I would not be trading leverage here. 
Expect massive volatility.

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. Some time ago price declined to support 1, which coincided with the support zone, and soon broke this level and continued to fall. In a short time it declined to support 2, which coincided with one more support zone, some time traded near and later dropped to the trend line, breaking support 2 too. Next, the price started to grow near the trend line and quickly rose back to support 2, broke it, and then made correction. After this BTC rose almost to support 1, but then it turned around and declined below the trend line. Soon, the price rose back and continued to move up between the trend line and later reached support 1. Later BTC broke support 1 and even rose higher than the support zone and now continues to move up. For this case, I expect that BTCUSDT will correct to the support zone and then continue to move up, therefore I set my goal at 65000 points.

By analyzing the Bitcoin chart on the weekly timeframe, we can see that, based on the previous analysis, Bitcoin did not stabilize below the $57,870 level. After a short-term corrective wave, it was once again met with strong demand. Last night, following the announcement of a half-percent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, this cryptocurrency saw even more demand and managed to rise to $62,500. Now, we have to see if the price can break above $65,000 by the end of this weekly candle. It‚Äôs likely that Bitcoin and other altcoins will soon begin their main bullish wave, with Bitcoin's potential target in the mid-term being $80,000.

Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. By observing the chart, we can see that the price some days ago entered to triangle, where it at once started to decline from the resistance line and soon fell below the 61200 level, breaking it. Then the price dropped more and broke the 53300 level, reaching the support line of the triangle, after which it turned around and started to grow. In a short time price rose to a resistance level, which coincided with the seller zone, breaking the 53300 level one more time. BTC some time traded near the resistance level and then fell to the support line of the triangle and then quickly rose to the resistance line of this pattern, breaking the resistance level. But then the price made impulse down, thereby exiting from the triangle pattern and breaking the 61200 level too. Also, BTC started to trades inside the range, where it declined to support level, which coincided with the buyer zone and at once rebounded up. A not long time ago price reached a resistance level and soon rolled down, and now it declining. So, for this case, I think that the price can rise to the resistance level and then continue to fall to almost the support level. That's why I set my TP at 54800 points.

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. A not long time ago price rebounded from the support level and tried to grow, but after it rose a little higher than the resistance zone, it dropped below the 58300 level, breaking it. Then BTC made a retest of this level and continued to decline to the trend line. After the price fell to this line, it turned around and started to grow inside the upward channel, where it some time rose near the trend line, which support line of the channel and later rebounded up. Bitcoin almost reached the 58300 support level, but then made correction, after which continued to move up. When the price reached the 58300 level, it at once broke it and rose to the resistance line of the channel. But recently price rebounded and made a correction movement to the support level. And now it continues to trades near this level inside the resistance area in an upward channel. In my mind, BTCUSDT will fall to the trend line and then rebound and start to grow to the resistance line of the channel. That's why I set my goal at 60800 points.

The most terrifying scenario
Away from the chart, markets, resistances and supports
We all know the things that the Middle East is going through from the current conflict and wars
There is a regional war approaching between the Israeli and US teams and the other team, Iran and its allies
What is different this time, according to experts, is that Tel Aviv will completely destroy the world's financial capital
Which includes the headquarters of major trading platforms such as Coinbase, Binance, OKX and others
And many of the super-rich American Jews will provide absolute support to Israel in this war
By selling large assets of digital currencies ..... and many measures that will make this market go through a deadly period
Finally
If you have entered this market with all your money, do not sleep before you set a stop loss
If this scenario comes true, we will see Bitcoin in one candle falling to levels of 20k and perhaps less
And there are alternative currencies that will disappear completely from the market

#BTC is currently in an important resistance area of 60,000 - 61,000 . 

Some bearish signs are visible on the chart, as soon as the blue trendline gets broken, market will most probably face intense sell pressure and BTC will probably head for 55,000 zone and then 52,000. Sell strategy is advised!

Hello trader's
Here is the new analysis for bitcoin for long term .

Yello, Paradisers! Have you been watching #BTCUSDT closely over the last few days? It's been showing some promising strength, but could this be a trap in the making? Let‚Äôs break it down so you don‚Äôt get caught off guard.

üíé#BTCUSDT has been steadily trading within a parallel channel, and while the recent closes above 61k seem bullish, there‚Äôs more to the story when we zoom out to the macro picture.

üíéOn the higher time frames, BTCUSDT continues to form lower lows and lower highs ‚Äî a textbook bearish trend. Right now, it's likely setting up for another lower high, which could lead to a significant rejection. The key resistance region to watch is around 64,193, and a rejection here could signal the next downward move.

üíéAbove this resistance zone, there's a bearish order block between 66,500 and 68,430. It‚Äôs highly probable that BTC will first push into this zone, clearing out the liquidity from those currently shorting. This classic liquidity grab could lure traders into thinking they've missed the move, prompting a rush to buy into the market. But beware ‚Äì this is exactly when the market tends to reverse.

üíéOnce the liquidity above the bearish order block is taken, expect a swift rejection. The market could wick slightly above this zone before retracing hard, possibly heading down to the next support regions at 58,963, with major support around 55,750.

üíéInvalidation of this bearish scenario occurs if BTCUSDT closes a daily candle above the previous equal highs near 71,398. If this happens, the bearish thesis weakens, and further upside could be on the horizon.

Stay disciplined, Paradisers! With the right strategy, this could be a huge opportunity. But don‚Äôt let emotions drive your trades‚Äîlet the levels and signals guide you!

Based on the analysis using the Algoman indicator, Bitcoin is moving within the $56K to  GETTEX:64K  range. Considering the formation of 4-hour order blocks, there is a high probability of a price interaction with the 4-hour order block around the  GETTEX:64K  zone.

BTC is attempting to break through resistance of ascending triangle pattern after bouncing off support. Wait for a decisive breakout above the ma 200 to confirm the continuation of the bullish trend . Up we go if we do breakout , also a bullish hidden Divergence (HD+) on MACD which shows Positive Signs for BTC.
The price can increase as much as the measured price movement ( AB=CD ) .
The break out needed for increasing further has not happened but it should happen pretty soon.

Hello everyone, 

This post highlights a series of technical patterns, all converging towards the same target area on Bitcoin. We‚Äôve identified a descending broadening wedge, a cup and handle formation, and another descending broadening formation. 

The alignment of these patterns reinforces our bullish bias on Bitcoin, suggesting that a major upside move is imminent. We believe the potential for a significant rally is stronger now than ever.

 Please share your comments and thoughts on this analysis.
___
After breaking the head and shoulders, Bitcoin could not break the important resistance of 61K and this caused the pressure of the bears to increase (the divergence shows this well) and the price decreased. We expect the price to decline until near 57K and after that I expect the price to rise again.

Good day traders!

Alright. For BTCUSD I'm still seeing the same pattern, however things are starting to look a little more optimistic. The pattern that I've been discussing for weeks now is the series of lower highs and lower lows. Once we break this pattern, then we can start to talk about that move to ATH and ~$85k above ATH.

We NEED to break  FWB:65K  and ideally with above average volume (which I did not discuss in the video). We need a breakout with volume to get some gas in the tank so to speak.

If we can do that, it simply increases confidence in the bullish scenario. There's never any certainty in the markets, but from a pattern perspective, we have to break the pattern in order to gain confidence in the next move. Break the pattern to the upside, I believe we'll see new highs. We have yet to break the pattern to the downside, but that is not off the table. I'm simply saying things are looking better from a bullish perspective  at this time .

After Bitcoin retraced nearly 19% from its recent highs, I believe it hasn‚Äôt yet reached the average cycle correction of around 22%, which could take the price down to about $57,500. In a more bearish scenario, the correction could deepen to 25%, or even extend toward $50,000‚Äã.

Factoring in U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, will drive short-term volatility, it is likely that it will lead to market downturns before any stable recovery‚Äã. Even if BTC does put higher and reach near $65,000,the short term upside would be capped as major selling pressure is likely to appear there. This makes the $60,500 level a reasonable point to short with a target of 
 around $59,000 at the 200EMA.

BTC is showing signs of an upcoming correction. Bearish indicators suggest a potential pullback, so it's time to prepare for a short trade opportunity. Monitor key support zones and watch for confirmation signals as the market cools down. üìâ #BTC #Bitcoin #CryptoCorrection

hello guys.

let's dive into btc analysis after the previous analysis:



 Broken wedge pattern:  The chart shows a clear breakout from a descending wedge, a bullish reversal signal, indicating a potential trend shift.

 Upward channel:  After the breakout, Bitcoin has been moving within an ascending channel, which provides a strong bullish structure for price movement.

 Support and resistance levels:  Immediate support can be found near $62,000, while the next target on the upside is projected around $66,000.

 Potential pullback:  A minor retracement within the channel might occur, but overall momentum remains bullish as long as Bitcoin stays within the channel.

 Bullish momentum:  With the strong volume and the breakout from the wedge, the next logical resistance area to test is around $66,000 or higher.

Hello all traders!

Today I will focus on the 1-hour chart of BTCUSDT, we can see that the price is currently trading around $58,460. But! there are signs that the price is moving within a clear bullish channel. If the price holds $58,000, I expect the price to rise first to $60,000 and even $60,500 to retest the previous support zone and 34.89 (EMA). After that, we can expect the BTCUSDT price to continue to fall down the price channel again and if that happens the possibility of a breakout will increase as the price has tested the lower price channel at least 4 times before.

Please support me by liking and commenting to motivate me to share more analysis with you and share your opinion on the possible trend of this chart with me!

üíéBitcoin Analysis- ‚è±4-Hour Timeframe

üí∞#Bitcoin managed to grow and hit its first target (61112.2) after breaking the monthly resistance (57877.90) on a daily timeframe (based on my previous analysis)üöÄ

üî¥Following the realization of the first target, it started an erosive decline within a 15-minute timeframe bearish channel (see figure)üîªüîª

üßêConsidering the breakout of monthly resistance, the main growth target has not been achieved yet. Consequently, #Bitcoin could experience further growth‚úÖüöÄ

‚úåÔ∏èThere are two scenarios for continued bullish movement (although other scenarios are possible that I won't address for now)üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£Scenario 1: If the decline doesn't deepen further and its recent 15-minute timeframe bearish channel breaks upwards, #Bitcoin could continue its growth by forming a cup pattern (see figure).

2Ô∏è‚É£Scenario 2: If the decline deepens, the bullish trend-line of the recent move on the 15-minute timeframe could be the location for forming the next bottom and restarting growth. In this case, it would likely grow based on an rising wedge pattern.

üéØSubsequent Growth Targets:
üöÄ Target 1: 61640.70-61885.40 range
üöÄüöÄ Target 2: 63461.30-64149.35
üöÄüöÄüöÄ Target 3: 66755.85

‚ùåStop-loss for Growth Scenario and Entering a bearish Phase: If #Bitcoin breaks the 57877.90 support on a daily timeframe, the stop-loss for growth scenarios is activated and the trend changes from bullish to bearishüìà üìâ

üåü(Important support levels for #Bitcoin in case the stop-loss for the growth scenario is activated are marked in the figure (in red))

hello guys.

let's dive into the monthly time frame of btc analysis.


 Breakout Confirmation:  
The candle highlighted in yellow, initially suspected to be a "hunting candle," has not confirmed its status as such. With 6 subsequent candles failing to validate a hunting pattern, it is more likely a breakout candle indicating a continuation of the bullish trend.

 Scenario Probability:
 The more probable scenario suggests a continued upward movement, targeting the next significant resistance level above $72,000.
The scenario where the price touches the lower level (around $42,000) is less likely, given the strong bullish momentum and support levels seen in the recent price action.

BTC/USDT trade on Friday, September 13, 2024, 

Trade Setup:
Entry Price: 60,308.3 USDT
Profit Level: 60,964.4 USDT (+1.09%)
Stop Level: 60,293.3 USDT (-0.02%)
Risk-Reward Ratio (RR): 43.74


Key Level:
The entry at 60,308.3 USDT is close to the psychologically important 60,000 USDT level, often a strong support/resistance zone in Bitcoin trading. If BTC holds above this level, it reinforces the bullish sentiment.
___
As you can see, BTC has created an ascending head and shoulders and , which has just been broken in the 4-hour time frame and this means that the price can be bullish and I expect the price to go up to the  Fibonacci line of 0.618 = 60k .  Stay tuned for more updates, thanks 

BTC From a different point of view !!!



Previous Analysis
___
Bitcoin rose 2.6% to $62,120 after the Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut in more than four years.
The move is consistent with typical investor behavior, in which lower interest rates drive demand for riskier assets. Despite recent gains, bitcoin has remained relatively stable since reaching an all-time high of nearly $74,000 in March.

The move is expected to have a profound impact on the economy because it will affect the rates at which banks can lend to individuals and businesses.

But for Bitcoin, this is a positive, Bitcoin return to 74K will not be far away. Hesitating friends should seize the opportunity.
___
While Bitcoin has been pushy, we are still around our zone of fakeout, where bulls have not yet secured this zone.

We are looking for a possible rejection near the current area, which would lead the price back below EMAs so all attention is on the current market price!

___
Bitcoin  started to rise well from near the  Support line  and the  Support zone($55,780-$54,550)  again.

According to  Elliott's wave theory , Bitcoin completed the  main wave 4  with  Zigzag Correction(ABC/5-3-5) .

In terms of  Classic Technical Analysis , Bitcoin has succeeded in breaking the  upper line  of the  Bullish Flag Pattern .

We can also see the  Morning Star Candlestick Pattern , which can be a sign of the completion of  Bitcoin correction  or the  main wave 4 .

I expect  Bitcoin  to break the  Resistance zone($58,000-$56,600)  and  100_SMA(4-hour TF)  in the  coming hours  and rise to at least the  Potential Reversal Zone(PRZ) .

 Note: If Bitcoin goes below the Support zone($55,780-$54,550), we should expect Bitcoin to dump to $51,000(at least).

üìà The BITCOIN Price Playing Below The Crucial 60600$ Resistance Level And I Expect a Breakout Toward a 68k Area As a Next Main Target, Totally There Is Now Bearish Sign At Both High And Low Timeframes And I Think Correction Is Over And We Wont See New Lows
___
It is observed that price is traded within a band (blue channel) forming a pattern known as the bullish flag which is highlighted (green) pole and a trading channel (blue). 
This present a massive opportunity as this chart structure indicates a prospective price rise of about 70%. 
This also aligns with the other fundamentals like the US elections in November as usually market makers will take position before significant events.

The idea is to buy at the lower troughs of the blue channel while expecting a price break-out to about $88,000

ACTION PLAN
50,560-53,770	-- BUY
50,550 -48,659	--WAIT/ DO NOTHING 
BELOW 48,396	--SELL

However, this trade idea gives a risk reward  ratio of 8.9.

Goodluck!!

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà As per our latest analysis, attached on the chart, BTC has rejected the $50,000 - $52,000 support zone and has been trading higher since then.

As long as the bulls remain in control,  a continuation towards the $61,000 - $62,000 resistance zone is expected.

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

Fibonacci retracement levels serve as indispensable tools for evaluating retracement potential and identifying targets

This analytical scheme is most effective in market trends. In a market with an upward trend, the traders' goal is to determine the correction potential and strategically identify entry points for long positions. Conversely, in a downtrend, the focus shifts to evaluating correction potentials and tactically identifying entry points for short positions.

By utilizing Fibonacci levels with precision and insight, traders can navigate market dynamics with greater clarity and strategic foresight.

 Operating rules: 
‚óèIdentify the trend and work according to it
‚óèTo determine the correction potential for uptrend use the grid below up.
‚óèTo determine the correction potential for downtrend use a top-down grid.
‚óèFind Swing High and Swing Low for correct using the tool.

1. For an uptrend, the Fibonacci grid extends from HL to HH.
After breaking the downtrend from LL to HH.

2. For a downtrend, the Fibonacci grid extends from LH to LL.
After breaking the uptrend from HH to LL.

 Settings for corrective movements: 

 0.5 - fair price (equilibrium).
0.62; 0.705; 0.79 - OTE zone (optimal entry into a deal). 

Unlike the standard values, this is a modified version with the highest mathematical expectation of price reversal.
To open a position, we are always interested in the price behavior above or below the 0.5 value. 

The smart money will always look to buy at a discount and sell at a premium.

Therefore, to open a short position we always look at the price above 0.5, which is considered a premium. And to open long positions, we look at the behavior of prices below 0.5, which is considered discount prices.

  
  

The OTE zone is an extended grid that is always in the premium market when you are looking for a short position, or in the discount market when you are looking for a long position. 
These levels act as an area for the optimal entry point.

  
  

 Correction of the upward impulse. 
  

Fibonacci lines themselves do not act as support or resistance levels. It is not relevant to trade only on the basis of them. The price turns from specific areas that are displayed on the chart.

 Correction of the upward impulse. 
  

The price may go beyond OTE, this does not negate the relevance of the setup, HL is still being formed in the discount market.

 Correction of the upward impulse. 
  

Not in all cases, the price corrects to the OTE zone: when it reaches the support zone at the 50% level (equilibrium) or slightly below it, a reversal may already begin, because this moment already implies the start of buying or selling with smart money.

 Downward impulse correction. 
  

Make it a rule to open positions only after a correction in the premium or discount market, and skip other opportunities.

Take profit according to Fibonacci

In order to determine where you will take profits, you can use negative values.
Settings for setting takes:
-0.27 ‚Äì take 1
-0.62 ‚Äì take 2
-1 ‚Äì take 3 or closing the position
-1.5 / -2 ‚Äì take 4

 Fibonacci take 
  

Negative Fibonacci values can be used effectively on every trade, but try to prioritize the chart to identify more precise zones where price may reverse.

Hi guys, this is my overview for BTCUSDT, feel free to check it and write your feedback in commentsüëä

Some time ago price entered to triangle, where at once made downward impulse from resistance line to support line.

Price broke $63700 and $54900 levels, but soon turned around and rose higher than $54900 support level, breaking it again.

Next, BTC continued to grow and later reached resistance line of triangle, after which started to decline.

In a short time, price fell to support area, thereby exiting from triangle and starting to grow in rising channel.

In channel, Bitcoin rose to $63700 resistance level, where at the moment continues to trades very close.

Possibly, price can make a small movement below and then bounce up to $67600, breaking resistance level.

Bitcoin  has recently formed a bullish cup or U-shape pattern on the 1-hour time frame and has successfully broken above the flat top resistance.

Additionally, the RSI  is above 60 at the time of the breakout, providing further confirmation of the strength of the move.
An RSI above 60 indicates that the asset is in a strong bullish phase and that there is still momentum in the upward direction.

The depth of the Cup will be added to the breakout price and will act as a target price for this move.
___
Based on HEW analysis which took me about a month to complete, we are on wave 5 of wave C of wave 3.

according to this analysis, wave 3 will end at 48800-48400. then wave 4 will begin which is a very deep wave. This correction wave would be as long as 10000-15000 USDT.
___
BTC's price recently bounced from a strong support zone. A potential Bullish reversal seems in play as the price action has broken the previous Lower High. 

This is the 3rd Bounce from key Monthly Fibonacci levels since the previous massive Bull rally (along with further confluence from key Fibonacci Harmonic levels on the shorter 4HR time frame). 

Bounces from these critical levels may eventually lead to the completion of a massive Bullish flag/Cup & Handle Patterns on the Monthly time frames.

If price breaks the all time high and crosses 74000, the chances of TP2 will increase.
 
Trade Plan

Entry @ 60900
Stop Loss @ 52000
TP1 @ 69800 OR BW 0.8 - 1 RR
TP2 @ 78700 OR Ride further with extra caution

No. of Trades: 2

üåüMy analysis is that the future of #Bitcoin looks very exciting. Several big analysts and experts are working on this issue, and each of them says something different. Some, like Peter Brandt, think #Bitcoin might go down a little more, but others like Axel Adler are hopeful that its price will go up a lot.

üåüOn the other hand, big companies like MicroStrategy are buying #Bitcoin. This means that experienced and wealthy people think Bitcoin has a good future. The way Erik Voorhees and Max Keiser see it, Bitcoin can be a good alternative to the dollar and its value can increase significantly.

üåüBut there are also some things to pay attention to. For example, the Relative Strength Index of #Bitcoin shows that its price may rise very quickly and then fall suddenly. This means that the #Bitcoin market is still very volatile and we need to be careful.

üëÄLet's take a look at the chart and see what it tells usüëáüëá

üíéDaily #Bitcoin Analysis

ü§ØYesterday's surge (September 13th) propelled #Bitcoin above its most significant resistance level at 57,877.90. This breakthrough significantly enhances the likelihood of further bullish momentumüöÄüöÄüöÄ

üéØ‚úÖHaving breached this resistance, #Bitcoin is poised to extend its rally within its expanded structure, targeting:

üöÄTarget 1: 62,577.59-63,002.85
üöÄüöÄTarget 2: 66,755.85
üöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 3: 74,537.70
üëâPlease note that these targets are precise, not approximate

‚ùåStop-Loss for the Bullish Scenario and Potential Temporary Dip:

üî¥If the 57,877.90 support level is breached on the daily timeframe before reaching the subsequent bull-targets, #Bitcoin may enter a temporary bearish phase, potentially retesting the following support levels:

üîª51,676.75-52,489.40
üîªüîª48,483.55-50,096.10
üíéüöÄThese support levels are sufficiently robust to potentially reinitiate an bull-trend.

‚ùå‚ùåHowever, if a weekly candle closes below 49,000 due to a bearish move, #Bitcoin could enter a deeper and more prolonged bearish phase. In such a scenario, a long-term analysis update will be providedüîÑ

..................................
üíé#Bitcoin Analysis: ‚è±1-Hour Timeframe

üìàüìâTo encapsulate #Bitcoin's recent bullish momentum within a structured framework, we can overlay both a smaller and a larger bullish channel (refer to the attached chart).

üöÄThese channels serve as guiding lines for the bull-trend, providing a solid foundation for crafting growth scenariosüëá

‚úÖ‚úÖStrong Growth Scenario: As long as #Bitcoin remains confined within the smaller (more recent) bullish channel, there is a high probability of continued bullish movement with strong momentum.

üöÄThe support levels within this channel act as potential launchpads for renewed growth toward our primary price targets. These support levels include: the mid-line of this channel, the mid-line of the larger bullish channel, the daily support level at 59585.21, and the channel's lower boundary!!

‚úÖModerate Growth Scenario: A breakout below the smaller channel could lead to a retest of the larger channel's low. This low, which aligns with the static support range of 57877.90-58545.41, represents a second and final opportunity to halt the decline and initiate a new upward leg toward our price targets!!

üîªBearish Scenario: A breakout below the larger channel on the 4-hour timeframe, coupled with the activation of our daily stop-loss, would signal a temporary bearish phase.


‚ö†Ô∏èPlease note that this analysis represents my personal opinion and should not be solely relied upon for decision-makingüôè‚ù§Ô∏è

- Current volatility period: September 9-29
- Next volatility period: Around October 7

- The most important support and resistance zones at the current price position: 60672.0-61099.25

- Support and resistance zones when rising
1st: 63118.62-64000.0
2nd: 65920.71-67614.25

- Support and resistance zones when falling
1st: 57889.10-59053.35
2nd: 56150.01-56950.56

--------------------------------------

(Example of how to select a volatility period using the StochRSI indicator)


It is the turn to form a low zone in the wave flow, but by breaking through the high trend line (1) upward, There has been a change in the wave.

The wave that has been going on until now was a downward wave, but it has now broken through the current high trend line (1) upward, making it an unknown state.

Therefore, the section where the high trend line (1) and the low trend line (2) intersect, that is, the section marked with a circle, can be called a volatility section.

In order to continue the existing downward wave, it must fall below the high trend line (1).

If not, there is a high possibility that a new wave will be created.

Therefore, the day when the high trend line (1) and the low trend line (2) intersect, that is, around September 13 (September 12-14), can be called a volatility period.

However, when selecting a volatility period, it is important to have support and resistance lines and trend lines drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

What I have just mentioned is an example of selecting a trend change and volatility period using the flow of waves using the StochRSI indicator.

Trend lines that intersect important support and resistance lines indicate more significant periods of volatility.

-
The high trend line is drawn by connecting the high points of the StochRSI indicator, that is, the opening prices of the bearish candles corresponding to points a1 and a2.

(If the candles corresponding to points a1 and a2 are not bearish candles, move to the right until a bearish candle appears.)

The low trend line is drawn by connecting the low prices of the candles corresponding to points b1 and b2 of the StochRSI indicator.

The trend line is ultimately a lagging indicator drawn after the price has passed.

If you say that auxiliary indicators do not need to be considered lagging indicators, I think that means you do not need to look at trend lines either.

Therefore, rather than rejecting indicators, I think it would be good to use them as reference material to create a trading strategy by utilizing several indicators that fit your investment style.

-

Based on the explanation above, if we select the next volatility period, October 7th is the volatility period.


This volatility period is the volatility period selected on the 1W chart, and the week before and after September 16th is the volatility period.

Therefore, September 9th-29th is the volatility period.

However, based on the volatility period selected on the 1D chart, we can see that this volatility period began in earnest around September 13th.

---------------------------------------------------


The lines are drawn in a complicated manner, but if you have been watching the explanations I often give, I think you will notice the important parts.

Therefore, you should pay attention to the points, sections, trend lines, indicators, and volatility periods that I mentioned.

-
The most important section for the current price position is 60672.0-61099.25.

Therefore, the key is whether it can rise above the 60672.0-61099.25 section and receive support.

Since the sell line of the superTrend indicator is formed at the 60674.89 point, it supports that the 60672.0-61099.25 section is an important section.

If not, it is important whether it can receive support near the 59053.55 point, that is, the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator.

-
If the StochRSI indicator falls from the overbought section and maintains the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, the price is likely to eventually fall.

In other words, the StochRSI indicator must touch the overbought or oversold zone to close the current wave and start creating a new wave.

Since it can create a continuation wave of the existing wave, you can refer to the trend line drawn using the StochRSI indicator mentioned above.

-
As explained in the previous idea, if it rises above 61099.25, the next support and resistance zone is 63118.62-64000.0.

-
You should draw support and resistance lines in advance before starting a transaction.

Otherwise, if you draw support and resistance lines after starting a transaction, your psychological state will begin to be reflected, making it difficult to draw important support and resistance lines, so you should avoid it.

To prevent this, we created a support and resistance point display using auxiliary indicators.

If you use this, I think you can exclude many psychological factors when drawing support and resistance lines even after starting a transaction.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

This is an example of starting a trade, explaining that you should objectively define the basics that are right for you.

Therefore, I hope that this will be an opportunity to reexamine your trading judgment criteria rather than judging it as right or wrong.

-----------------------------------------


It is showing a downward trend without breaking through the sell line of the superTrend indicator.

Accordingly, the key is whether it can receive support near the M-Signal indicator (approximately 59953.52) on the 1W chart and rise above 60672.0-61099.25.

If not, you should check whether it is supported near the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart).

Therefore,
1st: 59053.55
2nd: 57889.10
You should check whether it is supported near the 1st and 2nd above.

-
Usually, there are many cases where you trade impulsively based on your psychological state.

To prevent this, it is good to have an objective trading method according to your investment style.

This objectification is best done at the support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

Therefore, it is good to trade based on whether it is supported near 59053.55 or 60720.0-61099.25.

However, judging whether it is supported only by sight can lead to an incorrect judgment depending on psychological factors that occur during trading, so it is good to have objective information as the basis for judgment.

It refers to indicators added to the chart as objective information.

The MS-Signal indicator is used as a trend-related indicator, which is the M-Signal indicator of the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

As a trading-related indicator, the HA-Low, HA-High indicators and their corresponding box sections, superTend, and volume profile are used.

As a trading-related reference auxiliary indicator, the BW indicator and StochRSI indicator are used.

-
If we explain the current movement by referring to these indicators,

- The superTrend indicator, which is passing around 60672.0-61099.25, has failed to rise above the sell line,

- It is showing a downward trend below the M-Signal indicator of the 1W chart,

- The StochRSI indicator is showing a trend of changing from an upward to a downward slope in the overbought section. However, since the StochRSI indicator has not yet fallen from the overbought zone and is not in a state where StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, it is difficult to see it as a downward turn.

Therefore, an aggressive sell (SHORT) is possible between the M-Signal indicator of the 1W chart and the 60672.0-61099.25 range.

Afterwards, when the StochRSI indicator falls from the overbought zone and becomes a state where StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, if it shows resistance near 59053.55 or the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator, you can sell (SHORT).

If it is supported at the point mentioned above, you can buy (LONG).

However, it is recommended to check whether the state has been changed to StochRSI > StochRSI EMA.

If not, it can pretend to rise and fall right away.

-
Have a good time. Thank you.

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Please click "Boost" as well.
Have a good day today.

-------------------------------------

When you start studying charts, the first thing you learn is about candles.

However, you start studying about the Open, Close, High, and Low of candles.

When you start studying about the Moving Average, you start to think that you understand the charts.

However, when you actually start trading with the Moving Average, you realize that nothing works properly.

So, you start studying other indicators.

-
The above is based on my experience. When you study various charts, you may think you know them, but when you actually start trading, you realize that they don't apply at all.

Where on earth did I go wrong?... What I learned after a long time is that I was wrong from the very beginning.

-
In other words, I realized that my subsequent chart studies were not done properly because I lacked understanding of candles.

When you start studying candles, you study candles of various shapes and patterns.

At this time, you should not be too obsessed with the names of candle shapes or patterns or the conditions that occur and try to memorize them.

It is important to read it repeatedly several times until you can grasp the concept of the arrangements formed by the combination of candle shapes or patterns, that is, the support and resistance points.

Eventually, when the candle shapes or patterns are combined, you can find the volume profile section formed around it, that is, the section where trading volume occurs.

By drawing and marking the support and resistance points you find in this way on 1M, 1W, and 1D charts, you can create a trading strategy on the charts you mainly trade.

That's all the experts in chart analysis say.

In the end, everything is about looking at the combination of candles that make up the chart, finding the corresponding support and resistance points, and trading according to your trading strategy.

A trading strategy is to create a response strategy at the corresponding support and resistance points based on the three things above:
1. Investment period
2. Investment size
3. Trading method and profit realization method

However, since most books do not include trading strategies, you will only learn about the timing of trading and closing of trading using various indicators.

Because of this, there are many cases where you cannot respond to the volatility that occurs after starting trading and end up losing money.

Even so, it is difficult to specifically define the contents of trading strategies.

This is because the investment period, investment size, and trading method are different depending on the individual's investment style.

Therefore, what I can tell you is that you need to set the buy, sell, and stop loss points according to the support and resistance points obtained through chart analysis and wait for a while.

Due to price volatility, you may not touch the buy, sell, and stop loss points or may move past them.

You should learn how to create a trading strategy by modifying the way you respond to these things according to your investment style.

-
One important thing here is that you should mark the support and resistance points in advance through chart analysis before starting trading.

Otherwise, if you start trading and then mark support and resistance points, psychological factors will come into play, which will likely lead to an unexpected transaction.

Don't forget this, and you should practice marking support and resistance points in advance before starting a transaction.

Also, you should avoid analyzing charts after listening to various articles, news, or community content.

The reason is that psychological factors can come into play.

-
I think trading is a response to the movement of prices that fluctuate in real time.

Therefore, waiting and determination are necessary.

If you wait too long or do not make a decision and pass it by, there is a high possibility that you will suffer losses or make little profit, so you need something to refer to when waiting or making a decision.

That is the support and resistance points I mentioned above.

-
However, support and resistance points alone do not solve everything.

Therefore, you should add trend lines and various indicators to ask for a method of responding to price fluctuations.

However, since the trend line is formed by a diagonal line, there is a lack of countermeasure strategies using the trend line.

Therefore, the trend line is used to literally find out what the current trend is.

-
Therefore, when it deviates from the trend line, the movement at the support and resistance points is checked and the corresponding response is made.

When trading with a chart consisting of the above two support and resistance points or only the trend line, there are often cases where the transaction cannot be properly conducted due to fakes or sweeps.

Therefore, in order to counter these fakes or sweeps, various indicators are added to the chart.

The most commonly used of these is the price moving average.

Even if you add the price moving average, you realize that it is a curve, just like the trend line, and is therefore not suitable for countermeasure strategies.

So, the price moving average is also used to check the trend, just like the trend line.

-
In that regard, the indicator I recommend is the StochRSI indicator.

The default settings for the StochRSI indicator are 14, 7, 3, 3 (RSI, Stoch, K, D).

The value of the Signal line (EMA) of the StochRSI indicator is 7.

If the StochRSI indicator rises in the oversold zone and maintains the state of StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, it is a buying period.

On the other hand, if the StochRSI indicator falls in the overbought zone and maintains the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, it is a selling period.

However, you should trade depending on whether there is support or resistance at the support and resistance points formed at that location.

Even if there is movement in the StochRSI indicator, it is recommended not to trade if you do not have support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

The reason is that you may feel psychologically anxious, so there is a possibility that the trade will proceed incorrectly.

-
If you can trade with only what I mentioned above and make an average profit, it is because you have established a trading strategy according to your investment style.

-
We need objective information to establish a trading strategy according to your investment style.

We think that this is the only way to minimize the psychological factors that arise when starting a trade.

If you can add various indicators to the chart to obtain objective information and receive support and resistance point information according to them, you can create a trading strategy according to them at any time.

To do this, we used the StochRSI, OBV, CCI, and RSI indicators to display support and resistance points on the price candle part.

And, we added the StochRSI and BW indicators as auxiliary indicators.

The StochRSI indicator added as an auxiliary indicator is not the StochRSI indicator provided by default, but an indicator with a modified formula, so you can share the chart and use it or copy and paste the TS-BW UP indicator to your own chart and use it.

There is no problem using the basic StochRSI indicator.

However, there is a slight difference from what I said, so there may be a slight problem in understanding.

-
As above, since the support and resistance points of the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts are drawn on the chart to create a trading strategy, my chart is very confusing and not easy to understand when you first look at it.


And, since there are many indicators that I have not explained, it may be even more difficult to see the chart.

Therefore, to resolve the difficult parts, share the chart, hide the indicators added to the chart, and activate them one by one while looking at them, and you will be able to understand the chart.

If you share the chart, you can use it normally, so you can check the chart from various angles.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

ü§öHello everyone,

üåüIt's clear that Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency, has the potential for significant growth after a period of stagnation. Some analysts even predict it will reach over $92,000 by the end of the year

üåüThere are rumors that, contrary to expectations, the Federal Reserve is going to increase interest rates, which could be bad news for Bitcoin. However, I believe that even if this happens, the impact will be short-term, and in my analysis, I discussed a short-term bearish phase. But keep in mind that this is just a rumor and there is no certainty

üåüOn the other hand, if interest rates decrease, it usually leads to an increase in the price of cryptocurrencies (which is more expected). The recent decline in the crypto market can be attributed to investors waiting for the Federal Reserve's late-week report on interest rates, as well as the failed attempt to assassinate Donald Trump

‚è±Daily Analysis üëâ #Bitcoin

‚úÖ‚úÖBitcoin has significantly increased its chances of growth after breaking through the monthly resistance level of 57877.90.

‚ÄºÔ∏èFollowing this breakout, we've witnessed a 3-day decline on the daily timeframe. However, this decline has been gradual and hasn't completely engulfed the previous bullish candle‚ùå

üöÄThe events of the past 4 days strengthen the scenario of a potential rebound after this corrective decline and upon reaching the critical support zone of 57877.90-58116.32.

üöÄOn the daily timeframe, the formation of a strong bullish candle that completely engulfs the previous three bearish candles would confirm a continuation pattern and signal a renewed uptrend.
üí∞(Note: I will discuss conditions for faster growth on lower timeframes in the subsequent analysis.)‚úåÔ∏è

‚úÖBullish Targets:
üöÄTarget 1: 61112.20-61640.68
üöÄüöÄTarget 2: 64149.35
üöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 3: 66755.85
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 4: 74537.70

üîªConversely, if weakness persists in the following days and Bitcoin breaks below the 57877.90 support on the daily timeframe, the stop-loss for the bullish scenario will be activated, and we can expect a temporary pullback towards the previous lows and support zones of 52083.28-52489.40 and 49000.00-50096.10.

üî•These support levels have the potential to halt the decline and initiate a new uptrend

.........................................
‚≠êÔ∏èContinuing the analysis based on the 1-hour timeframe‚è±

‚ö†Ô∏èDespite the downward break-out of the bullish channel on the 1-hour timeframe and the potential for increased selling pressure, Bitcoin has immediately encountered its most significant support zone (57700.79-58116.32).

üöÄThis could prevent further declines, even after the channel breakout.

üëÄThere is a possibility of bottoming patterns forming in this area, which could be the genesis of a new uptrend. Therefore, the price action in this zone for today and tomorrow should be closely monitored, especially on the 1-hour and 15-minute timeframesüí∏

‚úÖHowever, the current condition for the start of an uptrend based on the 1-hour timeframe is the breakout of the bearish trend-line of the recent bearish move (see figure)üöÄüöÄ

‚ùåThe stop-loss for the bullish scenario and entry into the bearish phase has been mentioned in the daily timeframe analysis (main analysis)üëÜ

Hello everyone,

Today, I‚Äôve prepared an educational guide on chart patterns, specifically focusing on the Flag Pattern.

This content is designed to be easy for beginners to follow, so I hope you find it engaging and informative. :)

Below is the outline I‚Äôll be using for this post:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Outline 

1. What is a Flag Pattern?
 
  Definition
  Key Components
  Characteristics
 

2. Bullish Flag Pattern
 
 Basic Characteristics
 Examples
 

3. Bearish Flag Pattern
 
 Basic Characteristics
 Examples
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 1. What is a Flag Pattern? 

 1) Definition 
 
 A Flag Pattern forms during a brief consolidation phase after a strong price movement, often signaling the continuation of a trend. It typically appears when prices make a sharp move, either up or down, followed by a period of sideways or slightly counter-trend movement.
 Flag Patterns can occur in both uptrends and downtrends, named for their resemblance to an actual flag. After a strong price move, the market consolidates briefly before continuing in the original trend direction.
 

 2) Key Components 
 
 Flagpole: The initial strong price movement that sets the overall trend direction before the consolidation phase.
 Flag: The consolidation period where prices move sideways or slightly counter to the trend, often forming a rectangle or parallelogram. This phase typically occurs with a decrease in trading volume.
 Breakout: The moment when the price resumes its original trend direction. In an uptrend, this is an upward breakout, and in a downtrend, a downward breakout, confirming the continuation of the trend.
 

 3) Characteristics 
 
 Duration: The Flag Pattern typically lasts longer than the Flagpole but varies depending on the timeframe.
 Volume: Volume usually decreases during the Flag‚Äôs formation and increases once the breakout occurs.
 Reliability: The Flag Pattern is considered a reliable indicator of trend continuation, making it a favorite among traders using trend-based strategies.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 2. Bullish Flag Pattern 

 1) Basic Characteristics 
 
 A Bullish Flag forms after a strong upward price movement, signaling a temporary consolidation phase. During this consolidation, volume typically decreases, suggesting that the market is pausing rather than reversing. After this phase, the price often continues its upward trend, accompanied by an increase in volume. Bullish Flag Patterns also help relieve overbought conditions in technical indicators, providing the market with a chance to prepare for another move up.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 This chart from May 2023 shows a strong Flagpole followed by a long consolidation phase (Flag). The volume then increased as the price broke out, completing the Bullish Flag Pattern.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this chart from March 2021, we see a similar setup: a strong Flagpole, followed by a consolidation phase, leading to a breakout that continued the upward trend.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Bearish Flag Pattern 

 1) Basic Characteristics 
 
 The Bearish Flag Pattern is the inverse of the Bullish Flag. It follows a strong downward move (Flagpole) and is followed by a period of consolidation (Flag) with decreasing volume. Like its bullish counterpart, the Bearish Flag can relieve oversold conditions, leading to a continuation of the downtrend after a breakout.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 This chart from May 2022 displays a Bearish Flag Pattern: a strong downward Flagpole, followed by a Flag consolidation phase. After the consolidation, a breakout occurred, continuing the downtrend.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 This chart from February 2022 also illustrates a strong downward Flagpole, followed by a consolidation phase (Flag), leading to a breakout that completed the Bearish Flag Pattern.
 This guide will help you better understand the Flag Pattern and how it can be used in your trading strategy effectively!

 ‚úîÔ∏è Conclusion 
 I hope the various Flag Patterns and market analysis techniques covered in this post prove helpful in your investment journey. Chart analysis is not merely a technical skill but also a deeper understanding of market psychology and movement. Flag Patterns, along with other chart patterns, visually reflect the psychological dynamics of the market. Mastering their use can greatly contribute to successful trading.

That being said, the crypto market is inherently unpredictable and fast-moving. While technical analysis is a valuable tool, it‚Äôs important to adopt a comprehensive approach that considers broader market trends and external factors. I encourage you to apply the insights gained from this post with a balanced and cautious perspective when making investment decisions.

New opportunities are constantly emerging, and those who are prepared to seize them will find success. The chart represents the market‚Äôs voice. Listening to it, interpreting it, and making informed decisions based on that interpretation is "the essence" of chart analysis.

I sincerely hope that, through continuous learning and experience, you‚Äôll evolve into a more confident and successful investor.

In a previous analysis, I discussed the relationship between Bitcoin, the Altcoin market and Bitcoin Dominance. 


An important rotation exists between these three; and by using TOTAL3 together with BTC.D, you can get a clearer picture of where BTC is trading in the current cycle.


In this video, I make an important suggestion based off Elliot Wave Theory. This theory is backed up by the points mentioned but also by the Logarithmic view:


From the log scale, we can see BTC is still trading relatively low compared to previous cycle top-outs. So the question remains -  the end... or just the beginning?

BINANCE:BTCUSDT  appears to have found support in the 54000 - 53800 area, as evidenced by three fake breakouts on the daily timeframe. This indicates that this level holds significant importance; each time the price dipped below 53800, it closed above it afterward. I believe the market may remain in a range until the Federal Reserve's rate cut decision on Wednesday. Currently, we are seeing the formation of a giant triangle pattern characterized by a series of lower highs and higher lows, suggesting that the price is coiling up in before an extension. Given this setup, I expect the market to oscillate within this range until we receive clarity from the Fed's decision. The tension in the market could lead to a volatile breakout in either direction once the decision is announced. My target is resistance zone around 65000

Bitcoin is still inside our fakeout zone, where price has still the possibility for a sharp turnover to happen. 

Looking at last time we were at a similar zone where price is above EMAs by about 7% so this is the zone we should see a turnover. If we will push further from here, then this gameplay we planned here will not be valdi anymore!!

Bitcoin fooled traders where fakeout had another card in play. 

We are now entering again into the zone of fakeout, where price might see some liquidity movement. 

Our gameplay still remains the same for now and we wait for the price to fill lower zones here, so we wait to see the price again below 200EMA.

üì£Despite the recent decline in Bitcoin's price, "Michael Saylor", a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency market, continues to advocate for holding onto Bitcoin. This comes as some analysts, citing recent US employment data, anticipate a potential interest rate cut by the "Federal Reserve", which could drive up riskier assets like Bitcoin. In this analysis, we will delve into the technical reasons supporting this viewüëáüëáüëá

üî•#Bitcoin / ‚è±Daily Timeframe
üìå#Bitcoin failed to reach above the bearish channel on the weekly timeframe during its previous bull-trend.

üîªSubsequently, it has retested the channel's bottom with the recent decline.

üöÄAs a result, there is potential for growth based on a double bottom pattern and a triple divergence, targeting the channel's upper boundary.

‚úÖThis rally could initiate from the current channel bottom or the support zone of $49,000.00 - $50,096.10.

‚ö†Ô∏èIf it rallies from the channel bottom and reaches the first target of $57,877.90, a pullback to retest the second support zone is likely before a substantial uptrend resumes‚ÄºÔ∏è

üôÖRegardless, a breakout above the first target ($57,877.90), which is a crucial resistance level on the daily timeframe, is essential for the uptrend to continue‚úÖüöÄ

üéØSubsequent targets include:
üöÄTarget 2: $66,755.85
üöÄüöÄTarget 3: $74,537.70

‚ùåThe stop-loss for the bullish scenario is a breakout below the bearish channel and a daily candle close below $49,000.00 on the weekly timeframe.

üîÑIn this case, the trend would shift from bullish to bearish, potentially targeting $41,218.20 and then $34,494.20üëÜüëá

..................................
üî•#Bitcoin / ‚è±Monthly Timeframe
üî•Potential for a Significant UptrendüöÄüöÄ

‚úÖOn the monthly chart, #Bitcoin is showing signs of forming a flag pattern, which could signal a substantial price increase. 

‚ÅâÔ∏èHowever, for this bullish scenario to play out, the price needs to break above the flag pattern on the monthly timeframe. 

‚úÖIf this occurs, #Bitcoin could potentially rally to around $155,000üöÄüöÄüéØüí∞

Here is my trade plan on BTC on the next week. I assume that this is ICT's Market Maker Buy Model and last week the first stage disribution has been done. I expect the sceond stage distribution has been completed on the weekend or at least until Tuesday. So here is the chart for the idea :
___
From where we put the red arrow on the chart, it looks like a symmetrical (corrective) pattern is formed on the chart.

According to the waves, it seems that we are in the last wave of this symmetry (wave i).

We expect an upward price rejection from the green range.

Most likely, this bullish movement will be an x   wave, which means that it will not be a powerful movement.

We also expect downward price rejection from the supply box.

The complexity of the chart is high, observe capital management in your trades.

Closing a daily candle below the invalidation level will violate this view and analysis.

For risk management, please don't forget stop loss and capital management

Hello traders,

Bitcoin price tested 53k support area again and currently is in a correction phase.

I expect BTC price to trade in the range between 53k and 61k before 18th September when the FED expected to cut rates. 
After that event all markets might plunge in the short term but in the long term this should be bullish.
Considering all this, it's highly important for Bitcoin price to hold above the 50k area in the short term before all markets will start to recover.

Will Bitcoin manage to hold a 50k support area is another question but if it fails to do so then we might see BTC reaching 47k or even 42k areas. 
But in any case I don't expect the price to stay at those levels for too long as it is more likely to recover quickly.

Please, do not forget to boost this idea and leave your comments below, thanks.

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price some time ago rebounded from the resistance level and dropped lower than the support level, which coincided with the support zone. After this, BTC turned around and in a short time rose higher than the 53900 level, breaking it, and then continued to grow to the resistance level. When the price reached this level, it some time traded near it, after which made the correction and later backed up to the 61200 level. Soon, BTC broke this level and then reached a trend line, after which the price turned around and dropped lower 61200 level, breaking it one more time and continuing to decline. Price declined near the trend line to the support zone, after which the price turned around and made an impulse up, breaking the trend line. At the moment, BTC continues to move up, so, I expect that price will continue to move up to 61200 resistance level. For this case, my goal is this level. If you like my analytics you may support me with your like/comment ‚ù§Ô∏è

The day has arrived!! Today is predicted to be the first rate cut by the FED since the COVID crash of March 2020! Two years after that in March 2022 the FED begun rate hikes in an attempt to stop the rising inflation. Now that inflation is close to the FEDs target of 2% it's time to stimulate the economy with cheaper borrowing.

The big question is, 25bps or 50bps? 

Last week we saw the ECB (European central bank) cut their interest rates by 60bps from 4.25% to 3.65%, although this news has somewhat gone unnoticed, I'm not so sure the FED would have ignored it. If Europe has considerably cheaper borrowing rates than the US it could signal more growth to come from Europe and that would not be ideal for the US. 

Now this doesn't necessarily mean that Europe will be favoured by investors for long as this is only the beginning of rate cuts, Europe could taper off earlier or US could be more aggressive later on, we don't know for sure but I don't think America would want to fall behind.

Prediction markets have shown the 50bps cut is growing in probability. Now at 61% chance for 50bps according to FED funds futures (At time of writing). 25bps is definitely priced in, but I don't think 50bps is priced in. This should see risk markets get a boost.

In terms of TA, the 4H BTC chart looks ready to breakout, back above the 200EMA and 4H support. Flip the 4H resistance and $65,000 is the target.

Be carful today with leverage as volatility will be crazy, plenty of whipsawing and generally the first move direction is wrong. Stay safe out there.
___
The layout on the 4H chart:
- In the short-term trend, a decline to 57,745 is expected.
- In the mid-term trend, a rise to 62,818 is anticipated, with consolidation above that level potentially leading to collection of liquidity above ATH, up to 74K

Key point: The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates will be announced on September 18, 2024, at 18:00 UTC. The forecast is a 0.25% rate cut, though a 0.5% reduction is also possible.
Potential cut will boost growth of Bitcoin
___
By examining the trend in the one-hour time frame, Bitcoin has a resistance range of the ascending channel ceiling in the range of $60,625 and now, provided it is maintained, the price can decrease to the support range of the channel floor in the range of 57,632-57,243.

Looking at the 4-hour chart of Bitcoin, we see upward fluctuations from the price of $52,000 to the price of $60,000. Bitcoin has now reached its dynamic range and is engaged with this resistance zone.
As can be seen in the chart image, Bitcoin is expected to face an increase in supply from the specified resistance range at the price of $62000-$63000 and make a corrective movement towards the specified support areas and levels.

Assalamu Alaikum and Good Morning to All My Brothers and Sisters,

After observing the weekend's price action, it's time for our first Bitcoin analysis of the week. I waited until Monday to gain a clearer picture of Bitcoin's next move.

Current Market Outlook:
Bitcoin made an impressive jump last week, but now it appears we might be seeing a slight retracement. The price is currently consolidating near a bull flag pattern. If we get a confirmed breakout above the blue line on the 4-hour timeframe, we could soon witness a breakout of the yellow zone.

What's Next?
Should Bitcoin break and retest the blue line successfully, we could be in for a strong upward movement. The blue line is acting as support, and just above it, we've identified a key resistance on the 4-hour chart. A breakout here would be a very bullish signal. This could potentially send Bitcoin towards the $60k-$61k range. Breaking through the yellow area would be monumental, as it would open up the path to the next yellow zone, pushing us towards  GETTEX:64K  or higher.

Bearish Scenario:
On the flip side, a bearish scenario is quite straightforward. Yesterday, Bitcoin closed below the daily resistance (black line). If today's candle confirms this breakout on the daily timeframe, we could see Bitcoin lose all the gains it made last week. 

Altcoin Market:
Altcoins are following Bitcoin's movement, climbing up during Bitcoin‚Äôs surge and dropping during its retracements. Our recent confirmed breakout signals are still in profit, while others remain near their entry levels. We're waiting for clearer confirmations before opening additional buy trades, which will likely come after Bitcoin's direction becomes clear.

Stay tuned, and I wish you all a profitable week ahead. Have a great day!

In this article, we will simplify complex market structures by breaking them down into easy-to-understand patterns.  Recognizing market structure can enhance your trading strategy, increase your pattern recognition skills in various market conditions. Let‚Äôs dive into some essential chart patterns that every trader should know.

 
 Double Bottom / Double Top 

A  double bottom  is a bullish reversal pattern that occurs when the price tests a support level twice without breaking lower, indicating strong buying interest. This pattern often suggests that the downtrend is losing momentum and a potential uptrend may follow. Conversely, a  double top  signals a bearish reversal, formed when the price tests a resistance level twice without breaking through. This pattern indicates selling pressure and suggests that the uptrend may be coming to an end.


 Bull Flag / Bear Flag 

A  bull flag  is a continuation pattern that appears after a strong upward movement. It typically involves a slight consolidation period before the trend resumes, providing a potential entry point for traders looking to capitalize on the ongoing bullish momentum. On the other hand, a  bear flag  forms during a downtrend, signaling a brief consolidation before the price continues its downward movement. Recognizing these flags can help traders identify potential breakout opportunities.


 Bull Pennant / Bear Pennant 

A  bull pennant  is a continuation pattern that forms after a sharp price increase, followed by a period of consolidation where the price moves within converging trendlines. This pattern often indicates that the upward trend is likely to continue after the breakout. Conversely, a  bear pennant  forms after a sharp decline, with the price consolidating within converging lines. This pattern suggests that the downtrend may resume after the breakout.


 Ascending Wedge / Descending Wedge 

An  ascending wedge  is a bearish reversal pattern that often forms during a weakening uptrend. It indicates that buying pressure is slowing down, and a reversal may be imminent. Traders should be cautious as this pattern suggests a potential downtrend ahead. In contrast, a  descending wedge  appears during a downtrend and indicates that selling pressure is weakening. This pattern may signal a bullish reversal, suggesting a possible upward breakout in the near future.



 Triple Top / Triple Bottom 

A  triple top  is a bearish reversal pattern that forms after the price tests a resistance level three times without breaking through, indicating strong selling pressure. This pattern can help traders anticipate a potential downtrend. Conversely, a  triple bottom  is a bullish reversal pattern where the price tests support three times before breaking higher. This pattern highlights strong buying interest and can signal a significant upward move.


 Cup and Handle / Inverted Cup and Handle 

The  cup and handle  pattern is a bullish continuation pattern resembling a rounded bottom, followed by a small consolidation phase (the handle) before a breakout. This pattern often indicates strong bullish sentiment and can provide a solid entry point. The  inverted cup and handle  is the bearish counterpart, signaling potential downward movement after a rounded top formation, suggesting that a reversal may occur.


 Head and Shoulders / Inverted Head and Shoulders 

The  head and shoulders  pattern is a classic bearish reversal signal characterized by a peak (head) flanked by two smaller peaks (shoulders). This formation indicates a potential downtrend ahead, helping traders to identify possible selling opportunities. The  inverted head and shoulders  pattern serves as a bullish reversal indicator, suggesting that an uptrend may follow after the price forms a trough (head) between two smaller troughs (shoulders).


 Expanding Wedge 

An  expanding wedge  is formed when price volatility increases, characterized by higher highs and lower lows. This pattern often indicates market uncertainty and can precede a  breakout in either direction . Traders should monitor this pattern closely, as it can signal potential trading opportunities once a breakout occurs.


 Falling Channel / Rising Channel / Flat Channel 

A  falling channel  is defined by a consistent downtrend, with price movement contained within two parallel lines. This pattern often suggests continued bearish sentiment. Conversely, a  rising channel  indicates an uptrend, with price moving between two upward-sloping parallel lines, signaling bullish momentum. A flat channel represents sideways movement, indicating consolidation with no clear trend direction, often leading to a breakout once the price escapes the channel.
 

 P.S.   It's essential to remember that market makers, whales, smart investors, and Wall Street are well aware of these structures.  Sometimes, these patterns may not work as expected because these entities can  manipulate the market  to pull money from unsuspecting traders. Therefore, always exercise caution, and continuously practice and hone your trading skills.

As previously mentioned on my BTCUSDT analysis, I believe we're in the latter part of a major complex pattern for wave 4 - and in order to finish this corrective wave, it would be ideal for price to push higher for a higher high, and after we've done that at around 65k - 70k range the price can dump all the way down to $49,000 and below to create a lower low. Now, if it pans out as I just laid it out, we're set for a giga pump for Q4 2024.

BTC Double Top Pattern What's Text ?

Bitcoin Has Recently Formed a small double top pattern. The price had Already Broken down from the nick line confirming a further decline .

Speculation is high regarding the upcoming FOMC Meeting and the potential Rate cut they might announce. How ever BTC remains indifferent to these speculation and has not shown any significant rise in the recent days. If this situation persists BTC may continue to move downwards.

Should this trend continue BTC Could Potentially Drop further possibly reaching the 54K level.

But I might be wrong because again this is a complex structure. However, thinking as market maker this will be the perfect scenario to hit both bull and bear. 

What you guys think?

Functionality and Key Features 
 
 Volume Momentum Using MACD: This indicator calculates the MACD based on smoothed volume changes. By using the difference between two moving averages of volume (short-term subtracted from long-term), it highlights significant shifts in volume momentum, which are essential for confirming trend strength and sustainability.
 Fractal Analysis: Fractals are used to identify natural repetition patterns in price movements around significant highs and lows. This indicator employs multiple fractal lengths to capture a comprehensive picture of market structure and pivot points, enhancing the detection of potential trend reversals or continuations.
 Trend Confirmation: By combining the insights from volume momentum and fractal analysis, this tool filters out false signals and provides a more reliable confirmation of the underlying market trend.
 
 
 How It Works 
 
 The MACD of volume highlights shifts in market momentum, with a focus on how recent volume compares to historical norms.
 Fractals delineate critical points in the price structure, offering visual cues about potential turning points based on historical price action.
 The indicator synthesizes these elements to paint a clear picture of potential trend developments, signaling green when both volume momentum and fractal proximity suggest a bullish trend, and red when they indicate bearish conditions.

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Have a nice day today.

-------------------------------------

I'm publishing this in advance because I have a schedule.

The content below is the explanation part necessary for understanding the chart.

Therefore, you don't necessarily have to read it, but if you want to use my chart and indicator, you can refer to the explanation that I often give like this.

-
Let's summarize the current chart content.
- Current important support area: 61099.25

- When rising
1st: 63118.62-64000.0
2nd: 65920.71-67614.25
The 1st and 2nd areas above correspond to the support and resistance areas.

Among these, the next important point after 61099.25 is 65920.71-67614.25.

- If it falls below 61099.25
1st: 57889.10-59053.55
2nd: 56150.01-56950.56
The 1st and 2nd areas above are support and resistance zones.

- If it moves according to the previous flow, it is expected that the trend will be determined again after rising to around 65920.71.

However, since the StochRSI indicator shows signs of entering the overbought zone, we need to check at what point it is supported when it falls from the overbought zone.

Therefore, we need to look at how the StochRSI indicator is initialized.

--------------------------------------

No one actually knows what the future trend will be.

However, we can only guess based on the current movement and respond accordingly.

Therefore, it is necessary to objectively observe what kind of movement the chart is showing.

However, since the candlestick charts that we commonly see have volatility exposed as it is, it is likely that it will be difficult to analyze and interpret the chart.

Therefore, it is necessary to exclude elements such as fakes and sweeps from the movement of candles.

For that, I think the Renko chart is a good chart to use.

(Renko 1D chart)

I think you can know where the support and resistance points are and what the current trend is without me explaining it separately.

Let me explain a little more.
- If it falls below 56,000, a new downtrend is likely to form.
- Since it is currently moving sideways in the 56,000-70,000 range, it is likely that an uptrend will begin only if it rises above 70,000.

I have roughly explained the important areas in the current price position.

-

You need to create a trading strategy based on whether there is support at the support and resistance points, but it is not easy to check whether there is support.

Therefore, to supplement this, we utilize the BW indicator and StochRSI indicator.

The BW indicator included in the TS-BW UP indicator is an indicator that comprehensively evaluates and displays the StochRSI, MACD, CCI, PVT, and superTrend indicators.

Therefore, when it is at the lowest point (0), it is judged that a low point section is being formed and we look for a place to buy.

To confirm this more quickly, we made the BW line drawn near the price candle.

On the other hand, when it is at the highest point (100), we judge that a high point section is being formed and we look for a place to sell.

Similar to the principle of the BW indicator, we utilize the StochRSI indicator.

In other words, when the StochRSI indicator rises in the oversold section, we look for a place to buy, and when it falls in the overbought section, we look for a place to sell.

I have talked a lot about how to utilize the StochRSI indicator before, so I would appreciate it if you could refer to the previous idea.

---------------------------------------------

(BTCUSDT 1D chart)

Actually, I don't need to draw a separate trend line on my chart.

However, many people look at the trend line and check the trend with the pattern according to it, so I just drew it.

When it is judged necessary to select a volatility period, a trend line is drawn.

Since BTC or ETH charts occupy a large portion of the coin market, we draw a trend line to select a volatility period and inform you.

-

The trend is confirmed with the MS-Signal indicator.

The MS-Signal indicator consists of the M-Signal line and the S-Signal line.

Therefore, the current trend is determined based on the arrangement of the M-Signal lines on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

If M-Signal on the 1D chart > M-Signal on the 1W chart > M-Signal on the 1M chart, it is considered to be in a full-blown uptrend.

If M-Signal on the 1D chart < M-Signal on the 1W chart < M-Signal on the 1M chart, it is considered to be in a full-blown downtrend.

Since M-Signal on the 1W chart > M-Signal on the 1D chart > M-Signal on the 1M chart, it can be interpreted that it is maintaining an uptrend in the long term, but is showing a downtrend in the short and medium term.

Therefore, whether this uptrend can be maintained by switching to M-Signal on the 1D chart > M-Signal on the 1W chart is an important issue from a trend perspective.

-

If you have confirmed the trend, you should check what happens during the trading period and create a trading strategy accordingly.

Therefore, first, you need to find a trading period.

To do this, we utilize the HA-Low and HA-High indicators in the HA-MS indicator.

The HA-Low indicator is generated when it breaks out of the low range.

Therefore, if it falls below the HA-Low indicator, it is likely to show a stepwise downtrend, and if it receives support, it is a section where you can buy.

The HA-High indicator is generated when it breaks out of the high range.

Therefore, if it rises above the HA-High indicator, it is likely to show a stepwise uptrend, and if it receives resistance, it is a section where you can sell.

Therefore, the narrower the gap between the HA-Low and HA-High indicators, the higher the possibility of large volatility.

In other words, you can check convergence and divergence.

-
If you have confirmed the trading period with the HA-Low and HA-High indicators, you need support and resistance points to create an actual trading strategy.


To do this, I used several auxiliary indicators to draw horizontal lines.

You can distinguish the strength of the support and resistance roles based on the length of these horizontal lines.

However, you need to draw support and resistance lines on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

For now, I will only talk about the support and resistance lines on the 1D chart for explanation.


The points that are currently performing the strongest support and resistance roles on the chart are 69499.85, 68393.48, and 58697.01.

The next important points are 64179.08, 57889.10, and 56022.01.

You can create a trading strategy by selecting the support and resistance low points like this.


This is a chart that only shows the support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

There may be differences between the points explained above and the support and resistance points on the actual charts used.

The reason is that they were selected based on the importance of the support and resistance points.

The importance of the support and resistance points is in the order of 1M > 1W > 1D charts.

Therefore, if there are support and resistance lines on the 1W, 1D charts near the support and resistance lines drawn on the 1M chart, they are replaced with the support and resistance lines drawn on the 1M chart.


The BW line is drawn at the point where the arrow is pointing.

This BW line is a line drawn at the highest point (100), so it corresponds to the high point section.

However, since the StochRSI indicator has not yet clearly re-entered the overbought zone, it can be interpreted that additional increases are taking place.

Therefore, when the StochRSI indicator rises to the overbought zone and then tries to fall below the overbought zone, you should check whether it is supported near the BW line.

-
If it rises above 61099.25,
1st: 63118.62-64000.0
2nd: 65920.71-67614.25
The 1st and 2nd areas above correspond to the support and resistance zones.


If you look at the increase after breaking through the Sell line above, it seems to have risen by about 8-9%.

Therefore, if it shows an increase this time as well, it is expected to touch around 65920.71.

The 65920.71 point is an important point as the HA-High indicator point on the 1W chart.

The 67614.25 point is an HA-High indicator point on the 1D chart.

Therefore, we can see that in order for the stepwise uptrend to begin, it must rise above 67614.25.

Before that, the 61099.25 point is an HA-High indicator point on the 1M chart, which is a section that must be supported in order for the stepwise uptrend to begin from a long-term perspective.

Have a nice time.

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Please also click "Boost".

Have a nice day today.

-------------------------------------


The key is whether it can rise above the important section of 60672.0-61099.25.

However, if the StochRSI indicator is located below the overbought section and the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA continues, it is highly likely that it will eventually fall, so caution is required when trading.

If the price is maintained near the M-Signal indicator (above 59053.55) on the 1W chart, it is expected that there will be a challenge to rise above the 60672.0-61099.25 section again.

If it falls below 59053.55 this time, it is expected to fall to around 56K.

The reason is that the StochRSI indicator is likely to fall below 50.

-
We cannot tell how much the StochRSI indicator will rise or fall, but I think it tells us that there will be a change in the trend.

Therefore, the way to use the StochRSI indicator is:
- When the StochRSI indicator enters the overbought or oversold zone and a change in slope is detected

- When the StochRSI indicator intersects and is maintained with the StochRSI EMA indicator

We need to find a way to respond when the above two conditions are satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------------

(Example of how to draw and interpret a trend line)

If you look at the trend line from a short-term perspective, you can see that the low trend line and the high trend line intersect in an 'X' shape.

This shape appears when a trend change occurs.

The drawing of the trend line is
1. Low point trend line: Connect the low points when the StochRSI indicator makes the lowest point of the oversold zone.
2. High point trend line: Connect the high points when the StochRSI indicator makes the highest point of the overbought zone.

However, after making the lowest or highest point, it leaves the oversold or overbought zone and then enters the oversold or overbought zone again to make the lowest or highest point.

The intersection of the trend line drawn in this way and the support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts is likely to be a period of volatility.

However, you should be able to select an important point among the support and resistance points.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin when it rises above 29K.

The next expected range to touch is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23

5th: 178910.15

These are points that are likely to receive resistance in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this range is touched because it is thought that a new trend can be created in the overshooting range.

üìä#BTC reaches the staged resistance zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†We have been consolidating sideways in the selling zone for a long time. After finally digesting the selling pressure in this range, we chose to continue to break upward, so the selling zone turned into a support zone. At present, we have reached the stage resistance zone, and we do not recommend that you chase the rise in this range.

‚û°Ô∏èThe next resistance is located near the downward trend line (around 61k). If we develop relatively strongly, then the extreme resistance is located near the turning point 65175, which is also an ideal target area for the bull structure.

‚û°Ô∏èTherefore, we have locked in about 80% of the main profit, and will allow the remaining positions to wait for the ideal target without risk. üôèüéØ

We are now past Mercury's entire retrograde zone.

The downward retest on Wednesday 11 September did not reach 49K, it stopped at 52550. 

Moving forward I don't expect price to fall below @ 57041. That's close to the open on Thursday 12 September, which is the day that Mercury left His previous retrograde zone. I myself will try to get a fill to go long near Thursday's low.

  

On Monday 16 September Sun enters Virgo and reaches Venus's position of Sunday 25 August.

Bitcoin price will retest and  pass  65K on this date, continuing upwards.

After that I See bitcoin taking out its previous highs, because the next major downtrend only begins when Mars enters Cancer on Sunday 20 October. But for this leg up I hope to take profit at about 68K and then assess where to re-enter.

Hi everybody. If you want to directly invest in BTC its not a time. Market have more then 150K BTC to sell in near weeks. Bears target is X-Lines 1W level - 47800 and maybe 45000. So my opinion - falling. Have a nice trading day and short your bitcoins ;)

Hello, I'm Whale_signal

Let's get to the point

BTCUSDT - There Were Two Purple Whale Indicators On The 1H Chart I Previously Posted

The purple whale index below shows dirty moving,

The above purple whale indicator (with whale photo) showed a precise touch and a $1300 rise


Unfortunately, other rooms and real-time chart sharing should consider the above purple whale indicators (the section with whale photos) as important. The explanation has been emphasized additionally and consistently (with certification)

As expected, I was able to get a good return by breaking through the second purple whale indicator (the section with whale photos)


Now, you can look at the purple whale index at the top
It's Chuseok holiday in Korea, so you can refer to the chart above without much updates

If you're curious about more real-time updates
Please refer to the real-time chart sharing (free) of whale indicators below

Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. By observing the chart, we can see that the price not long ago declined in a downward channel, where it dropped from the resistance line to the seller zone, which coincided with the resistance level. Then the price bounced up and tried to grow, but soon continued to fall. In a short time, BTC declined below the 57900 level, but later turned around and rose to the resistance line of the channel, after which it reversed and fell to the support line of the downward channel. Then the price rose to the 57900 level and even entered the seller zone, after which it dropped to the support level, exiting the downward channel, and soon broke the 54800 level, falling even lower. But after this, Bitcoin turned around and started to grow inside the upward channel, quickly rising to the 54800 level, which coincided with the buyer zone, and broke it again. Next, the price rose to the resistance level of the channel, after which it rolled down. So, in my opinion, BTC can decline a little more and then start to move up to the resistance line of the upward channel, thereby breaking the resistance level. In this case, I set my TP at 59000 points, which coincides with this line. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ

Hello, this is full-time trader full_time_trader88.

Here‚Äôs the Bitcoin market analysis for September 10.

Let‚Äôs dive right in.




 (Ascending Channel Perspective)

üî¥ Ascending Channel 1 

This is the first short-term ascending channel (pink).
 Bitcoin has broken out to the upside and even completed a support retest.

The price was already trending upwards within the channel, but this breakout further solidifies the bullish outlook.

 üîµ Ascending Channel 2 

This is another smaller ascending channel, which has also broken to the upside‚Äîanother positive indicator.

As long as these ascending channels hold, the overall trend remains bullish.





 (Descending Channel Perspective)

üü† Descending Channel 

This descending channel had been in place for about a week. After breaking down through the lower boundary, Bitcoin has rebounded and is now testing the upper resistance.

Currently, it‚Äôs facing resistance for the third time.
A breakout from this channel would be a significant move.




 (Both Channels Together) 

Here‚Äôs what the combined view of both the ascending and descending channels looks like.





 (Bollinger Bands Perspective)

üî¥ Lower Bollinger Band Break 

Recently, the candles broke below the lower Bollinger Band.

Historically, when this occurs, the price tends to rebound towards the middle band, and it has done so recently.

Given this pattern, we can expect a potential rise to the middle Bollinger Band,
currently sitting at $58.9K.





 (Angle Perspective)

üîµ Gradual Decline Followed by a Steep Drop 

If you observe recent downtrends, they tend to begin with a gradual decline before accelerating sharply, which often marks the bottom.

The early September drop follows a similar pattern, suggesting we may be in a potential bottoming area.

In such cases, Bitcoin has historically rebounded beyond the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. For the recent drop, this would take us above $60K, indicating a possible short-term rally to that level‚Äîan encouraging signal.

(Of course, no chart pattern guarantees certainty.)





 (Symmetrical Triangle Perspective)

üü£ Mid-sized Symmetrical Triangle 

This is a mid-sized symmetrical triangle spanning 43 days.

As it hasn‚Äôt broken out yet, it could potentially extend to a 50‚Äì60 day consolidation period.

This is one of the largest symmetrical triangles we‚Äôve seen this year.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Volume 

The volume within the triangle is inconsistent, making the pattern less reliable.
However, due to its size, I‚Äôm watching it closely.





 (Large Descending Channel Perspective)

üü¢ Large Descending Channel 

This large descending channel has been in place for about six months, dating back to March 2024.

Bitcoin has stayed within this channel throughout, with every candle contained inside. It‚Äôs quite a persistent structure.

The recent bottom coincided with a bounce off the lower boundary of this channel, making it a key support level.

(Previous attempts to break below were unsuccessful, as the daily close remained inside the channel. The daily close is, therefore, an important indicator.)






 (Major Support Zone Perspective)

üü£ Consolidation Before a Major Rally 

Historically, Bitcoin consolidated for around 10 days before a 50% rally.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Major Support Zone (50.5‚Äì53.0K) 

I‚Äôve highlighted a rectangular box at this consolidation area, which now serves as a major support zone.

This area has provided key support during Bitcoin‚Äôs lows in July, August, and September.

I view the 50.5K‚Äì53.0K range as a critical support zone.





 (Combined View of Symmetrical Triangle + Large Descending Channel + Major Support Zone) 

Here‚Äôs what the chart looks like when we combine these elements.






 (CPI Schedule)

‚ö™Ô∏è CPI (Consumer Price Index) 

The CPI data will be released on September 11 at 8:30 AM.

It‚Äôs essential to observe whether this data impacts the crypto market. 

Historically, CPI releases have had a significant influence on crypto prices, so be cautious as we may see increased volatility during this period.

-


 

1. The uptrend is still intact.

2. The outcome of the mid-sized symmetrical triangle and large descending channel will be pivotal.

3. Be prepared for potential volatility during tomorrow‚Äôs CPI release.


This is a simple summary of my thoughts. 

Please use it as a reference, and I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your follow and like.

Thank you!

Hello everyone!

Bitcoin is currently displaying the  '3 Market Phases,'  and we‚Äôre transitioning from Contraction into Expansion. As long as the price holds above the lower boundary of the horizontal channel, I believe there‚Äôs a strong likelihood of continued upward momentum.



 Key points: 
 
 Break below the channel:  A breakdown could signal the beginning of a significant downtrend. However, if the channel holds, the uptrend is expected to persist.
 Uptrend continuation:  There‚Äôs a solid chance we could see a rise toward the 63K level.

As of the author, the current section is the section where the 3-1 count and 3-2 counts end after the 4-count rise, and the 3-3 count rises after the 5-count section ends.

Bitcoin has broken the falling trend channel in the short term and reacted strongly up. For the time being, it is difficult to say anything about the future trend direction. The currency is testing support at points 58000. This could give a positive reaction, but a downward breakthrough of points 58000 means a negative signal. The currency is assessed as technically neutral for the short term.

We just flipped the POC or highest volume node of the range (white box).

Bulls want to see volume pick up here after CME open, then we can play into 63-64k.

Hi guys, this is my overview for BTCUSDT, feel free to check it and write your feedback in commentsüëä

A few moments ago price entered to rising channel, where it reached $61800 level, broke it, and continued to move up.

Price reached resistance line, then it turned around and started to decline and soon exited from channel.

Next, price continued to decline in wedge, where it declined lower than $61800 and $55700 levels, breaking its.

Then BTC reached support line of wedge and then started to grow inside another rising channel.

In this channel, price broke $55700 level and at the moment it trades near resistance line of channel.

Possible, BTC can reach resistance line of channel and then start to decline to $55500

Bitcoin  has been hovering near the $59,800 level, showing mixed signals across both the 1H and 4H charts. With the broader market awaiting a potential breakout towards the end of September, technicals reflect a market in consolidation mode, but with growing signals of a possible shift in momentum.

 1H Chart Breakdown: Weak Momentum Continues 

On the 1-hour chart, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain any upward momentum, hovering below the Bollinger Band Basis ($60,101). The RSI at 41.71 and the oversold Stochastic (%K at 12.62) show signs of a potential bounce, though weak MACD signals and a low ADX at 13.13 indicate limited trend strength.

Resistance: $60,356 (Upper BB)
Support: $59,846 (Lower BB)
MACD: Bearish momentum

 4H Chart Breakdown: Testing Key Resistance 

On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin faces a stronger challenge near the upper Bollinger Band ($61,348), with the RSI at 58.42 indicating that momentum is still neutral to slightly bullish. The Stochastic is signaling overbought conditions with %K at 72.63, suggesting a potential pullback, but the MACD remains bearish with a histogram reading of -70.04. The ADX at 20.91 is still weak, signaling that Bitcoin is lacking a definitive trend direction.

Support: $57,463 (Lower BB)
Resistance: $61,348 (Upper BB)
MACD: Bearish, showing weakening momentum
OBV: 3.021M, showing some accumulation but not enough to signal a breakout

 Support and Resistance Levels (Across Timeframes) 

Immediate Resistance (1H & 4H): $60,356 - $61,348 (Upper BB levels, key psychological resistance)
Immediate Support: $59,846 - $57,463 (Lower BB)

 Actionable Strategy: Range-Bound Trading with Weak Momentum 

 Bullish Scenario: 
If Bitcoin can break above the $61,348 resistance (4H Upper BB), it may push toward $62,000 and beyond. A strong volume surge would confirm this breakout.

 Bearish Scenario: 
Failure to break resistance could result in a pullback to $57,463 (4H support). If Bitcoin drops below this, watch for a further retracement to $54,000, which is still possible based on historical patterns.

 Action Point: 
Traders should monitor the $61,348 resistance closely for any breakout confirmation. In the event of a pullback, consider entering long positions near $57,463 if support holds.

The end of September aka rektember historically the worst performing month of the year is in sight, and October is fast approaching. 

1/ October aka ‚ÄòUptober‚Äô or better to say "Moontober" is historically one of the best performing months of the year and in the past two bull run years October‚Äôs have all been green ‚Äì third time‚Äôs a charm? FYI last year we pumped 29% and so many of us ordered Countach

Excited for Uptober? Just wait till we hit No Loss November baaaby! 

3/ M2 projections vs.  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  looking bullish

M2 tracks the global supply of money. The more money is in the system, the more of it can flow into crypto. Here‚Äôs Bloomberg‚Äôs 10week projection of M2 supply (black) overlaid with  CRYPTOCAP:BTC ‚Äôs current performance (red)



4/ The bull market historically takes off at this point

See that white line? That‚Äôs the current cycle



as you see The crypto market seems to be following historical bull market trends closely. We've experienced a stronger than usual rally ahead of the halving, largely driven by expectations around spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the post-halving rally has been weaker, bringing the market back in line with typical patterns seen in previous cycles.

Potential for Growth: If past cycles are any indication, the market is expected to gain momentum from this point onward. Historically, after a weaker post-halving phase, a significant upward surge is needed to complete the cycle.

Cycle Length Considerations: There is evidence suggesting that each crypto cycle is lengthening in terms of duration. This trend may reflect increasing institutional involvement, as longer cycles often point to a more mature and stable market

5/ Rate cuts are here!
The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 50 basis points in their first rate cut since March 2020.This is now the most unexpected Fed decision since 2009.
And lowered rates allow more money to flow into markets over time.

Hello Traders! Should You Buy or Sell Bitcoin?

Overall, Bitcoin has been trending higher, after it broke above the parallel triangle, indicating significant potential for the Bulls in the near term. However, the price is now approaching the important resistance zone near $64,280, which is likely to result in a temporary correction.
After that, from the psychological support zone of $61,200, along with the push of the 34.89 EMA, we expect a major upside move. Traders can consider buying and targeting a profit at $69,580.

Today we have two targets for Bitcoin. The short moves looks exhausted, and the whole pattern (volume+pattern+order flow) looks bullish. The first target is the area at $59.100, next if Bitcoin will have enough strength, we can target the area at $59.700/$60.000
___
In this analysis of the Bitcoin/USDT daily chart, we observe several key technical patterns and indicators that guide my trading decisions. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $60,532.70, showing a significant increase of 3.98% on the day.

Firstly, the resistance levels (R1 and R2) and support levels (S1 and S2) are crucial in understanding potential price barriers. The first resistance level (R1) at approximately $56,715.30 has been recently breached, suggesting a bullish momentum. The next significant resistance level (R2) is at around $65,272.36, which could be the target if the bullish trend continues.

Conversely, the support levels (S1 and S2) at $48,629.92 and roughly $49,000 respectively, provide areas where price pullbacks might stabilize and potentially reverse.

The price has recently broken out of a downward trend, indicated by the red trendline, and has moved upward, crossing this boundary, which is a bullish signal. If the price can maintain above this breakout level, it would confirm the continuation of the bullish trend.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also indicative of growing bullish momentum, as the MACD line (blue) crosses above the signal line (orange). This crossover, coupled with a positive histogram, supports the idea of increasing buying pressure.

Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46.21, though closer to the middle, shows that there's room for upward movement before the asset becomes overbought. This indicates potential for further price increases before hitting overbought territory.

In conclusion, my analysis suggests that Bitcoin is currently on a bullish trajectory, having broken key resistance and showing strong signals on both MACD and RSI indicators. My strategy will involve closely watching the $65,272.36 resistance level for potential sell signals, while maintaining vigilance on the support levels for buy opportunities should any pullbacks occur.

Utility of Market Sentiment

The indicator aggregates signals from multiple technical indicators across various timeframes to compute an overall market sentiment score. This comprehensive approach helps traders understand the prevailing market conditions by:

Confirming Trends: Multiple indicators pointing in the same direction can confirm the strength of a trend.
Identifying Reversals: Divergences and fractals can signal potential turning points.
Timeframe Alignment: Aligning signals across different timeframes can enhance the probability of successful trades.

---

Divergences

Divergence occurs when the price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of a technical indicator, suggesting a potential reversal.

- Bullish Divergence: Price makes a lower low, but the indicator makes a higher low.
- Bearish Divergence: Price makes a higher high, but the indicator makes a lower high.

The indicator detects divergences for:

RSI
MACD
Stochastic Oscillator
On-Balance Volume (OBV)
Money Flow Index (MFI)
Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)

By identifying these divergences, traders can spot early signs of trend reversals and adjust their strategies accordingly.

---

Trendlines

Trendlines are essential tools for identifying support and resistance levels. The indicator automatically draws trendlines based on pivot points:

- Upward Trendlines (Support): Connect higher lows, indicating an uptrend.
- Downward Trendlines (Resistance): Connect lower highs, indicating a downtrend.

These trendlines help traders visualize the trend direction and potential breakout or reversal points.

---

Super Trend Reversals (ST Reversal)

The core idea behind the Super Trend Reversals indicator is to assess the momentum of automated trading bots (often referred to as 'Supertrend bots') that enter the market during critical turning points. Specifically, the indicator is tuned to identify when the market is nearing bottoms or peaks, just before it shifts direction based on the triggered Supertrend signals. This approach helps traders:

Engage Early: Enter the market as reversal momentum builds up.
Optimize Entries and Exits: Enter under favorable conditions and exit before momentum wanes.

By capturing these reversal points, traders can enhance their trading performance.

---

Conclusion

The Swiss Knife   indicator serves as a versatile tool that combines multiple technical analysis methods into a single, comprehensive indicator. By assessing various aspects of the market‚Äîincluding trend direction, momentum, volume, and price action‚Äîit provides traders with valuable insights to make informed trading decisions.

Looking at the chart for **Bitcoin (BTC/USDT)**, here‚Äôs a breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. **Market Structure:**
The chart shows a series of **consolidation ranges**, marked by the purple boxes, with the price moving between these ranges over time. These ranges suggest that the market is in a sideways, ranging phase, with clear support and resistance levels being respected. 

### 2. **Key Levels:**
- **Resistance Level (around 61,176 USDT):** Bitcoin is currently near a resistance zone, and from the recent history of the price movement, this level has acted as a barrier multiple times.
- **Support Level (around 59,569 USDT):** The price has bounced off this level a few times as well, and it seems to be a significant support zone in the current market.

### 3. **RSI Indicator:**
The RSI is hovering around **64**, which is approaching overbought territory but is not quite there yet. This suggests that the price could still move upward a bit before the market considers it overbought, but caution is warranted as a reversal could happen.

### 4. **Trade Plan:**
- Based on the current structure, you seem to be expecting a **rejection from the resistance** level near 61,176 USDT.
- The **downward arrow** in the chart indicates that you're anticipating a sell-off or correction once Bitcoin reaches this resistance zone, with the price potentially moving toward the next support area.

### 5. **Potential Targets:**
- **Short-Term Target:** You may expect the price to drop back to the 59,569 USDT level initially, which is the nearest support zone. 
- **Longer-Term Target:** If the price breaks through this support level, the next target could be around 54,000 USDT, as indicated by the lower support zone.

### 6. **Conclusion:**
This trade idea appears to be a **sell setup**:
- **Sell near resistance (61,176 USDT)** if a rejection occurs.
- **First target** at **59,569 USDT** (support).
- If the price breaks lower, you could look for a **further decline toward 54,000 USDT**.

This setup follows a classic range-bound trading strategy where the price is expected to reverse at resistance and head toward the nearest support level. Monitoring the RSI and price action around these key levels will be crucial for timing the entry and exit of the trade.

If you haven`t sold the top on Bitcoin:


Now you need to know that as the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated rate cut approaches, the market is bracing for potential volatility, and Bitcoin could be no exception. While many expect a modest 25 basis point cut, a more aggressive 50 basis point reduction is also on the table. This larger-than-expected move could trigger a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù scenario, affecting not only traditional assets like the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) but also risk assets like Bitcoin.

Initially, Bitcoin may see a slight uptick in price at the beginning of next week. This short-term rise could be fueled by optimism and increased demand for alternative assets as the market digests the Fed's decision. Bitcoin has historically benefited from periods of loose monetary policy, and in the immediate aftermath of the rate cut, it might experience some buying pressure.

However, this rally could be short-lived. With broader markets such as SPY and QQQ expected to correct following the Fed decision, Bitcoin is likely to follow suit. Given its high correlation with risk-on assets during periods of market stress, Bitcoin may see a sharp pullback as traditional equity markets start to sell off. Traders could also unwind their positions in Bitcoin alongside stocks, leading to a broader market correction in both traditional and crypto assets.

In the short term, a Fed rate cut that exceeds expectations might signal concerns about the underlying economy, leading to heightened volatility across the board. As risk appetite wanes, Bitcoin's upward momentum could quickly reverse, aligning with the expected correction in SPY and QQQ.
___
- Macro Overview

Investors continue to withdraw bitcoin, putting pressure on exchange balances, which have dropped below 2.99 million BTC. An additional $130.2 million investment into spot bitcoin ETFs, excluding IBIT, FBTC, and BRRR due to pending results, confirmed previous figures. Investors are more optimistic about the positive momentum in Q4, supporting bitcoin prices.

- Technical Analysis

After retesting the 57,660 level, BTCUSD recovered above both EMAs and formed a higher high. This strong bullish momentum has shifted the structure upwards, accumulating strength. If BTCUSD extends its rally beyond 60,600, the price could test 61,600 before reaching 62,800. Conversely, if BTCUSD remains below 60,600, the price may retreat to 59,200 before continuing the trend.

BTC price retraced and bounced off 0.786 fib so i expect this uptrend to be a bit weak and should go up till 65K before reversing. Will look for a sell entry in this position .

FOMC Rate Cut: 

 
 The Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, aiming to boost economic activity as inflation eases.

 This cut provides increased liquidity and lowers borrowing costs, likely benefiting speculative assets.
 

 Bitcoin‚Äôs Cup and Handle Pattern: 

 
 The cup and handle pattern in Bitcoin suggests a bullish breakout with a potential target of $120,000.

 Lower interest rates increase investor demand for Bitcoin, encouraging price gains.

 The favorable monetary environment supports a move toward this target, as investors seek higher returns in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies.  BITSTAMP:BTCUSD

Following FED's announcement and the 0.5% rate cut, market's reaction was positive and many coins experienced pumps as was expected. #BTC was no exception as well and the announcement helped BTC push through the 60,000 - 61,000 resistance zone.

Most important level ahead is probably 65,700 as daily close above the mentioned level can take BTC to 71,000 area.

TLDR for instant access of this document:
1 Fed Rate Cut Predictions: 50/50 chance of 0.25% or 0.50% cut, with 0.50% being more likely to prevent a market crash.
2 Market Insight: Expect high volatility in both BTC and stocks ahead of the rate cut, with manipulation and panic likely.
3 Strategy: Focus on strong risk management, protect holdings with stop-losses, and prepare for unpredictable market swings.
4 Mid-Term Outlook: Bullish through Q3 2025 with a likely resurgence in money printing after rate cuts..


 FED Rate Cut Report: Either .5 or .25 result, What‚Äôs Next? 
The Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate cut decision on September 18th is one of the most anticipated financial events of the year. There‚Äôs been a lot of speculation around whether the cut will be 
0.25% or 0.50%, with a 50:50 chance for either outcome. But if you've been following along, you know that I‚Äôve been calling for a less cut rate because 0.50% cut would open a can of worms which will lead us to 1 week of bloody market just like covid announcement, for months now I‚Äôve been thinking about 0.5 is a dangerous number to ask and the reasons are very simple that is why I decided to ask for 0.25 as this number is not easy to comprehend  and can manipulate and delay pumps vs 0.5 as this is clear crash and any crash so far was heavily bought by billionaires institutions and even retails, and the reasons are clear why.
 
 0.25% Cut vs. 0.50% Cut: A 0.25% cut at this stage would be too little. We‚Äôve already seen a significant market crash recently, and a small cut wouldn‚Äôt provide the economic support needed to stabilize things. On the other hand, a 0.50% cut would signal that the Federal Reserve is serious about maintaining economic momentum, particularly in light of falling inflation numbers.
 
 
 Inflation Data: I predicted twice that both the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index) would come in better than expected, and both predictions played out as expected. These improved inflation numbers give the Fed the leeway to justify a larger rate cut, and Jerome Powell will likely highlight this during the announcement.
 
If the Fed opts for the 0.25% cut, expect another market crash similar to the recent "Blood Monday" we witnessed. But with a 0.50% cut, the Fed can calm the markets, point to falling inflation, and possibly signal more cuts on the horizon.


 Market Insight: A Gamble on BTC and Stocks 
In the lead-up to the rate cut decision, the markets‚Äîespecially Bitcoin and stocks‚Äîare a complete gamble. It‚Äôs a casino right now, and anyone making moves in the market must be prepared for wicks on both sides and extreme volatility.
 
 Scam Wicks: Expect manipulations on both the long and short sides, with rapid price movements designed to shake out traders. This volatility is typical when the market is uncertain about a major event like the rate cut.
 
I‚Äôm personally holding my positions‚Äîboth spot and the longs I called at $50K and $53K during the recent crash that we missed and we are wrong about it means we failed to ride 48K as also stated in many of my live videos.. But for those who haven‚Äôt positioned themselves yet, be extremely cautious. If the 0.50% cut materializes, we could see short-term panic, especially with potential geopolitical risks like Israel possibly invading southern Lebanon adding fuel to the fire.
However, despite this short-term chaos, I remain bullish through Q3 2025 JULY. For long-term investors, these periods of panic can be a buying opportunity‚Äîespecially when fear peaks. Right now, my focus is on holding my current positions and waiting for the dust to settle.


Strategy for the Short Term: Manage Your Risk
In the short term, the key to surviving this period of volatility is risk management. If the Fed announces a 0.50% cut, both Bitcoin and stocks will likely face pressure, compounded by potential geopolitical events like the Israel-Lebanon conflict. Markets may react with fear, and the Fed could use this as a convenient excuse, attributing the market's reaction to geopolitical uncertainty rather than the rate cut itself.
 Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm managing my risk: 
 
 Stop-Losses: All my spot holdings and long positions are protected with stop-losses set at entry. This way, I minimize my risk‚Äîif the market takes a sharp turn, I won‚Äôt lose anything, but I‚Äôm also in position to ride a rally if the market moves upward.
 
 
 Stay Cautious: My risk management right now is at the highest level it‚Äôs ever been. This market is highly unpredictable, and my primary focus is on protecting my capital. I recommend others adopt the same strategy. Whether you‚Äôre managing a six- or seven-figure portfolio, this is the time to be extra cautious.
 
If the rate cut triggers a market pump, I‚Äôll simply ride the wave with my existing positions. But if we see a dump, my stop-losses will activate, protecting me from any losses. This is about surviving days like these‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to predict every move; you just need a solid plan for volatile periods. Surprises are inevitable, but with the right strategy, you can maximize gains and minimize risk.


 Mid-Term and Long-Term Outlook: Flood of Money Printing 
In the mid-term, any panic that arises will eventually be drowned out by the inevitable flood of money printing. We‚Äôve already seen examples of this in the past few months, with $18 billion USDT printed and more cash injections likely coming in Q4 2024, particularly from FTX.
Once the rate cuts are done, you can bet that the money printers will go back into full swing. Jerome Powell will likely have to pull the trigger on this again soon. This is why, despite the short-term volatility, I remain fully bullish for the mid- to long-term. The short-term is all about surviving the chaos, but in the long term, the Fed will continue to prop up the markets with fresh liquidity.

Earlier last week, disappointment around Trump's presidential debate performance led to  MARKETSCOM:BITCOIN  "selling the news,‚Äù dropping below $56K. This drop was anticipated on a technical basis, and the reaction was muted after higher-than-expected inflation figures on Wednesday were absorbed.

Markets were initially anticipating a 25 basis point rate cut from the Fed. However, recent data has shifted expectations towards a potential 50 basis point reduction. This change has added to Bitcoin's short-term uncertainty, as traders may be gearing up for a more significant cut. A rate cut @ 25 basis points could lead to a short-term sell-off as traders re-adjust.

Nonetheless, Bitcoin's consistent upward movement this week has led to a shift in sentiment to "cautiously optimistic." Prices are significantly improved compared to the levels observed when Bitcoin was hovering around the 53K mark.

With that in mind, this should be the level to bid if one considers the BMS and the current importance of staying above the mid-$56K range.

-----------

The key level for the entire market is critical. I would welcome a retest of the $42-44K range if September sees a downturn. For now, this is the level to target if you're bullish. A break below this range would shift my outlook to bearish, with the target previously mentioned in mind.

In the event of a breakdown, we need to see a V-shaped reversal to counteract the bearish trend. Without a strong reversal, expect bearish market conditions for the next six months.

Bitcoin is approaching the key support level of $56K, rebounding from the support level of $56,000 and thus achieving a recovery
On Friday, the Bitcoin price failed to close above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $60,685 and the downtrend line (multiple highs from the end of July).
Over the next three days, it fell 3.78 percent. At the time of writing today, the Bitcoin price continues to fall back to $58.8K.

If Bitcoin continues to pull back, it could find support near the daily level of $56,022. If this support can hold, it could make another attempt to break the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $60,685 and the downtrend line.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the awesome Oscillator (AO) on the daily chart are hovering near their neutral levels of 50 and 0, indicating that neither the bulls nor the bears can control the momentum. For the above bullish moves to continue, both indicators must be above neutral.
However, if Bitcoin closes below the daily support of $56,022, the bullish argument will fail. In this case, Bitcoin could retest the psychologically important level of $54K.

If we compare the stock market drops at August 05 and September 03, we can say that the crypto market is still holding up very well.
 But we shouldn't relax, because there are a lot of events coming up in September that will set the tone for the Autumn: 
1Ô∏è‚É£ September 6 - data from the labor market. July 5 and August 5 were extremely volatile downward after the data release. Now the market interprets and considers the most important indicator of the health of the US economy to be not inflation but the number of jobs created.

Hello Traders,

I hope you are all doing well.

If you have followed my previous BTC update, you'll know how strongly the 100 EMA is holding the price. This is the second attempt where BTC has tried to break above the 100 EMA ($60.7k), but it is still unable to do so.

According to our analysis, BTC must break above this resistance on the daily chart to reach the $68k-$69k target. If not, a rejection is likely.

Note: Expect volatility in the market over the next few hours. Be cautious and do your own research before investing.

- Current Resistance: 100 EMA at $60.7k.
- Bullish Scenario: A daily close above the 100 EMA.
- Bearish Scenario: A rejection below the 100 EMA.

Trade Safely.

Hello everyone, let's look at the current BTC situation considering the one hour interval.  In this situation, we can see how the price has moved higher from the local downtrend line above which it remains.
  Let's start by setting goals for the near future, which include:
T1- 60252$
T2- 62340$
T3- 64922$
  Now let's move on to the stop-loss in case the market continues to decline:
  SL1 = $58,076
  SL2 = $56,190
  SL3 = $555,256 AND
  SL4 = $54,044

  Looking at the RSI indicator, we see a movement at the upper limit, which may influence an attempt to recover or give a temporary sideways trend.

Bitcoin bounced off the ascending trendline and bounced off the support level. Bullish movement to resistance level at 60420 is expected to happen.

I‚Äôm shorting a very interesting setup here on the BTCUSDT 4H chart. We have an untapped 2H and 4H Order Block (OB) sitting above the current price, coupled with an untapped VWAP, both of which are significant points of interest for me. These untapped areas often act as strong magnets for price, drawing it towards them before a potential reversal.

Given the current market structure, this setup presents a high-probability short opportunity. The price has been showing signs of exhaustion as it approached these levels, and the confluence of the Order Blocks and VWAP makes it a very appealing zone to initiate a short position.

What adds to the strength of this setup is the clear Break of Structure (BOS) visible in the previous price action. The market has been creating lower highs and lower lows, indicating a downtrend, and the current move up might just be a retracement to mitigate the OB before continuing the trend downward.

I‚Äôm entering this trade with a tight stop loss, as the OBs and VWAP should ideally cap the upward movement. The stop loss is placed just above the OB, ensuring that the risk is minimal in case the price unexpectedly breaches these levels.

As for the final target, I haven‚Äôt set a specific level yet. I‚Äôll be closely monitoring how the price reacts after entering the OB and the VWAP. If the price rejects sharply, I‚Äôll consider holding the position longer, potentially trailing the stop to lock in profits as the trade progresses. However, if the reaction is weak or if I see signs of reversal, I might close the trade early.

The goal here is to capitalize on the anticipated price reaction from these high-probability zones while keeping the risk contained with a tight stop. This is a classic example of a mean reversion trade, where the price could revert back to the mean after tapping into these untapped areas.

Hey everyone!

Appreciate a like and follow if this analysis helps!

Bitcoin has successfully broken out from a symmetrical triangle in the 4-hour timeframe. However, a retest of the broken resistance level is likely.  Avoid impulsive buying (FOMO) and wait for a potential pullback. 

 Anticipated Timeline:

Sideways Movement:  Expect Bitcoin to trade sideways for the next week or two.
 Retest:  A retest of the broken resistance level (around $60k) is probable.

 Post-Retest Outlook:

Bullish Momentum:  A successful retest and subsequent close above the resistance could ignite a strong rally.
 Target:  The next major target is $80k.

Well BTC was a long on the L3 monthy... as it often is. now we are approaching H3 which often finds resistance. Possible we remain sideways and have some pullback from these areas. However if we do coninue to rally past monthly H4 in near term... I would watch out for much more upside. possible to even test monthly H4 at least if we close daily above H3

Hello, everyone.

Today, I‚Äôm excited to share the second part of my educational series on chart patterns.

In this post, we‚Äôll be focusing on the 'Head and Shoulders' and 'Inverse Head and Shoulders' patterns.

 For those who missed the first part, you can catch up here: 
  ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì


As always, I‚Äôve kept the explanations simple and beginner-friendly. I hope this guide provides you with valuable insights!

Here‚Äôs today‚Äôs outline:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

  Characteristics
 

 2. Head and Shoulders 
 
  Basic features
  Examples
 

 3. Inverse Head and Shoulders 
 
  Basic features
  Examples
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


 1. What is the "Head and Shoulders" pattern? 

 1) Definition 
 The Head and Shoulders pattern is a well-established reversal formation that appears after an uptrend and signals the potential start of a downtrend. It indicates that buying pressure is weakening and selling pressure is gaining momentum. 

 2) Key components 
 
 Left Shoulder:  The initial peak, where the price rises and then pulls back.
 Head : The highest peak, situated between the two shoulders, representing the final bullish push.
 Right Shoulder:  The third peak, which is typically lower than the head but similar to the left shoulder, signaling diminishing buying interest.
 Neckline:  A key support line drawn across the lows of the left and right shoulders. A decisive break below this neckline confirms the reversal and the beginning of a downtrend.
 
 3) Characteristics 
 
 Reversal signal:  The Head and Shoulders pattern marks a transition from an uptrend to a downtrend.
 Easy identification:  The structure is visually distinctive, with three clear peaks.
 Neckline significance:  A break below the neckline serves as a confirmation signal for the downtrend.
 Volume dynamics:  Volume typically rises during the formation of the left shoulder and head, decreases during the right shoulder, and surges again when the neckline is breached.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


 2. Head and Shoulders (Reversal from uptrend to downtrend) 

 1) Basic features 
 End of an uptrend:  The Head and Shoulders pattern forms at the end of a bullish phase, signaling a weakening in buying strength.
 Distinct peak heights:  The head is always higher than the shoulders, which are generally symmetrical, though the right shoulder may sometimes be slightly lower, enhancing the pattern‚Äôs reliability.
 Neckline as a trigger:  The neckline acts as a critical support level. A break below it confirms the pattern and signals the onset of a bearish trend.
 Volume confirmation:  Volume increases during the left shoulder and head formations, weakens during the right shoulder, and spikes when the neckline is broken, confirming a potential sell-off.
 Price target:  After the pattern completes, the expected price drop is typically equal to the distance between the head and the neckline, providing traders with a target.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 In this example, we see a fakeout at the right shoulder, followed by a sharp decline. 
 After a brief retest of the neckline, the price broke through and continued its downtrend.
 


 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this chart, a fakeout occurred when the price dropped from the head and formed the neckline, misleading many market participants. After forming the right shoulder, the price successfully declined. There were two retests, which confirmed the reliability of the pattern.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Reverse Head and Shoulders (Trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend) 

 1) Basic features 
 End of a downtrend:  The Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern typically forms at the end of a downtrend, signaling a potential reversal to the upside.
 Formation of lows:  Like the standard Head and Shoulders, this pattern consists of three lows‚Äîleft shoulder, head, and right shoulder‚Äîwith the head being the lowest point.
 Neckline significance:  The neckline is drawn across the highs of the left and right shoulders. A break above this line confirms the reversal and acts as a strong buy signal.
 Volume pattern:  Volume tends to decrease during the formation of the pattern but surges when the neckline is broken, signaling strong buying momentum.
 Target setting:  After the pattern is confirmed, the expected price rise is often equal to the distance from the head to the neckline, which helps traders set profit targets.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 After the Head and Shoulders pattern formed, the price broke above the neckline, successfully reversing the downtrend into an uptrend. A buy strategy would have yielded profits at the breakout point.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this example, a smaller Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern formed within the head of a larger pattern (see Example 3). After two successful retests, the price reversed into a strong uptrend.
 

 2-3) Example 3 

 
 This example showcases the smaller Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern mentioned in Example 2, located within the head. After two successful retests, a buy strategy could have led to profits as the price reversed into an uptrend.
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Conclusion 

 "Charts are the maps of the market." 

 The Head and Shoulders and Reverse Head and Shoulders patterns we‚Äôve covered in this post are key signals that frequently appear in the market. Charts aren‚Äôt random‚Äîthey are visual representations of market psychology and investor behavior. As traders, our role is to interpret these maps, navigate the market, and make informed decisions.

Investing is more than just buying and selling. Sometimes the market may move contrary to our expectations, while other times we seize opportunities and achieve success. Each experience is a chance to learn and grow. The more experience you gain, the more paths you‚Äôll recognize on the chart.

Success in this market requires persistence, patience, and continuous learning. Understanding and analyzing chart patterns like the ones discussed here is just the beginning. I hope this post has helped you gain a deeper understanding of the market and make more informed decisions.

The market is always evolving, but within that evolution lies opportunity. The key is developing the ability to spot those opportunities. With knowledge, experience, and confidence, you‚Äôll find greater success.

Stay prepared, and always listen to what the market is telling you.

BTC has broken the bearish channel so it will probably continue to rise until it touches 64K. We must be attentive because at this time, it is in an area of ‚Äã‚Äãuncertainty and could turn around. It is very convenient to adjust the SL so as not to lose the accumulated profits.

Bitcoin is positioned to break through the $60,000 resistance, supported by bullish momentum and strong technical indicators. A sustained move above this level could propel the price to $63,000, with the 0.618 Fibonacci level providing solid support around $55,300 in case of a pullback.

TLDR: 
The prevailing concept in CT is that once the Fed begins a QE cycle, prices of financial assets immediately shoot up. 
The data from two previous cycles tell a different story. The market doesn‚Äôt immediately react to rate cuts, if at all. It is after the rate cuts ended that the uptrend begins. 
 2007/2008 Rate Cut Cycle: 
Based on historical data from 2007 and 2008, Nasdaq 100. The first month of QE resulted in a bullish response. However, it was followed by a downtrend until the rates were zero. 
    
 2019/2020 Rate Cut Cycle: 
Based on the BLX chart. Excluding the initial bullish reaction, this QE cycle did not affect Bitcoin‚Äôs price. After rates were at zero, Bitcoin‚Äôs uptrend began. 
  
 Takeaways From Previous QE Cycles 
1. Fed cuts don‚Äôt change the trend. At least until the cutting cycle is over. 
2. Even if we assume a bullish reaction, it is short-lived. 
3. The Fed is late in responding to market conditions. 
4. The chances of a 50% rate cut in September are low. 
5. The Fed overreacts to recession conditions.
6. When the markets begin to tumble, it is a dumpster fire. The fed cannot put out the fire with rate cuts. 
 Bitcoin Cycle Analysis: 
My macro-outlook for Bitcoin remains that Bitcoin is in the process of completing a wave four correction, after which I expect a continuation of the bullish trend to at least 80K.
Within the wave four correction, the two primary scenarios are:
  
 Complex Correction: 
This scenario presumes that Bitcoin is in a wave four correction. According to this scenario, the final leg down in wave C of Y is missing. 
If this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, Bitcoin should begin wave C to the downside after hitting the reversal zone between 0.618 and 0.786 retracements. 
  
 ABCDE Triangle Breakout: 
According to this scenario, Bitcoin‚Äôs wave four bottom was on August 5th. Bitcoin consolidates in an ABCDE triangle before breaking out to the upside in the final 5th wave. 
If this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, Bitcoin is close to the 0.618 retracement. I expect it to be rejected between 61.1K and 62.5K (wick) to complete the final E wave. This will become the primary scenario if it can find support at around 54K and break out of the triangle. 
  
 Direct Breakout Scenario: 
This scenario assumes that Bitcoin finished the correction process on September 6th and is now on the verge of a breakout. Even if this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, I expect a pullback to 57K - 58K before continuing. 
 High Probability Support and Resistance Levels: 
1. 65K. Resistance.
 2. 62.5K. Resistance. 
3. 61K. Resistance.
 4. 58K. Support.  
5. 56K. Support. 
 6. 54K. Support.

Hello there,

BTC went down to 49221.93 and rallied up to 64133.59 for appears to be a B in a corrective wave. The higher low at 53315.24 creates the impression that price will continue bullish since to 49221.93, but that will need confirmation above (B) where in sits a supply zone.

Current candle structure does not support a strong bullish momentum but the break below of 57642.58 will be meaningful for any indication of bearish continuation.

The sentiment right now is highly bearish with two price targets for a bias of 31265.28

 Summary  : Current trend shows weak bullish momentum, and a drop below 57642.58 could indicate further bearish action, leaning strongly bearish toward even lower lows.

Happy Trading,
K.

Looking at the BTCUSDT chart, I see a strong breakout as the price has broken above the upper boundary of the falling wedge. Currently, BTC is around $60,500, and all eyes are on the new support zone at $60,000.

My plan is to wait for a slight correction to this support zone, which could be an ideal place to set up a buy order. Theoretically, if the support zone holds, the price could bounce strongly and continue towards the resistance zone of $61,148 USDT. If the price breaks this resistance level, the uptrend will be further consolidated and open the door for new highs.

Good luck to all traders!

BTC Update:

Bitcoin is moving as expected. Yesterday, it made a sudden drop but quickly recovered. The current price of $58.1k needs to move strongly to continue the rally.

Hi traders,

Last week Bitcoin followed exactly my analysis. So did you profit from this? 

Next week we could see another upmove from the 4H FVG.

Let's see what the market does and react.

Trade idea: Wait for a change in orderflow to bullish, a small correction down on a lower timeframe and trade longs.

If you want to learn more about my analysis, please make sure to follow me, give a like and respectful comment.

Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we had a strong day for Bitcoin, with a solid move to the upside, indicating positive momentum from the bulls. However, Bitcoin is now facing strong resistance at $60,800. If it breaks through this resistance level, we could see a push all the way up to $64,800, which is the next major resistance. However, it's more likely that Bitcoin will hit this resistance and pull back to around the $58,700 area. As I‚Äôve mentioned before, we‚Äôre not out of the woods yet. There's still downward momentum, and I‚Äôll keep you updated in the coming days and weeks.

I have been following the Bitcoin price action locally quite often, and would like to strategize a plan based on the current price action on the charts. 

At the moment, I believe we will likely move up to approx $60k to test the Value Area Low of the previous 6 month range. I do believe we will see seller's step in at that level and bring price back down below $50k where the low of the range liquidity can be taken and shoot right back up to grab the liquidity sitting above $70k. 

Being that rate cuts are quickly approaching, Im sure there will be some turbulence in the markets , especially around the election time. This uncertainty may bring us some amazing opportunities if we are well prepared.

In this video, we dive deep into the current bearish market structure
Focusing also on ETH/BTC and Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). Understanding these key indicators is crucial for gauging the broader market trend and positioning yourself for potential moves ahead.

We‚Äôll start by breaking down ETH/BTC, analyzing the weakness in Ethereum‚Äôs price action relative to Bitcoin, and what this could mean for altcoins in general. Next, we‚Äôll examine the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which is showing a shift in capital allocation within the crypto space. This movement could signal Bitcoin's growing dominance as altcoins lag behind.

Lastly, we discuss two critical Bitcoin price targets: the near-term resistance at $44,000, and the potential downside scenario to $15,000. These levels could define the next big moves for Bitcoin and the overall market direction.

Make sure to watch until the end to get a complete picture of the market‚Äôs current state and how to navigate it!

I keep seeing people talk about the BTC price consolidating. 
It's not consolidating.
We're seeing a series of lower highs and lower low's, and there's really not much support until we hit $44k. 
Next buying range is between $38k and $44k in my opinion.

ETH is looking a little stronger; it wont fall as far, but BTC looks really weak here....

üìö Welcome to the Educational Content Section of Our Channel: Technical Analysis Training
We aim to produce educational content in playlist format that will teach you technical analysis from A to Z. We will cover topics such as risk and capital management, Dow Theory, support and resistance, trends, market cycles, and more. These lessons are based on our experiences and the book The Handbook of Technical Analysis, as well as our learning and insights from the Trade City Pro channel.

üé®  What is Technical Analysis? 
Let‚Äôs talk a bit about technical analysis and patterns in life. Technical analysis is not a science; rather, it is an art. Therefore, there is no right or wrong in art. Instead, we apply rules we have created through experience in this lawless market.

üìä  Introduction to Dow Theory :  
Today, for the first part of our lessons, we will begin with Dow Theory, which was developed by American journalist Charles Dow. Many traders still use this method for analysis and trading.

üìë  Principles of Dow Theory :  
1 - The Averages Discount Everything (Not applicable to crypto)
2 - The Market Has Three Trends
3 - Trends Have Three Phases
4 - Trend Continues Until a Reversal is Confirmed
5 - The Averages Must Confirm Each Other
6 - Volume Confirms the Trend

üíµ  Principle 1: Price is All You Need 
Dow's theory operates based on the "Efficient Market Hypothesis," which assumes that the price of assets reflects all available information. In other words, this approach contrasts with behavioral economics. Factors like earning potential, competitive advantage, management competence‚Äîall are accounted for in the price, even if individuals do not know all the details. In more precise readings of this theory, even future events might be reflected in the current market price.

üìä  Principle 2: The Market Has Three Types of Trends 
According to Dow Theory, price movements in the market are trend-based, and these trends can be divided into three types:

1 - Primary Trend: This is the main movement of the market, dictating the long-term direction, and can last for years.

2 - Secondary Trends: These are corrective movements that run opposite to the primary trend. For instance, if the primary trend is bullish, the corrective trend will be bearish. These trends can last from weeks to months.

3- Minor Trends: These are the daily price fluctuations in the asset. Although minor trends can last for weeks, their direction will always align with the primary trend, even if they contradict the secondary trend.

üí°  Final Thoughts for Today : 
This is the end of this part, and I must say we have a long journey ahead. We will continually strive to produce better content every day, steering clear of sensationalized content that promises unrealistic profits, and instead, focusing on the proper learning path of technical analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please remember that these lessons represent our personal view of the market and should not be considered financial advice for investment.

Take the high and take the low. We are about to approach the red line. The middle of the range, which I think will serve as resistance. We could move to $61.4k by Wednesday, but the FOMC will shake the markets a bit then. On Friday, it will also be interesting to see if the Bank of Japan decides to raise rates.
___
üìä#BTC Bull Flagüìà

üß†From a structural point of view, the double top bearish structure at the weekly level is still intact, so the weekly level is a bearish trend, and its ideal target area still has a chance to be realized. We need to be alert to this possibility. If we can break through the turning point of 65,000, it means that the reversal structure of the same period will appear, and the double top bearish structure will most likely fail. If that happens, then we have a chance to challenge all-time highs.

‚û°Ô∏èFrom a graphical perspective, we have gone through a complex consolidation phase for about 6 months, and we can clearly see that the prototype of the bull flag has begun to take shape. I believe that it will not be long before we can see good performance again.

We probably won't see much price action today even though rates were cut to 5% yesterday. Many market participants are bullish, but this feeling can quickly disappear if the Bank of Japan (BOJ) decides to raise rates again, creating a situation like the one on August 5th. We got some clusters of liquidation around ~$63k but we have alot more at <$58k to liquidate.

This week, the Federal Reserve delivered a highly anticipated 50 basis point interest rate cut, the first of its kind in over four years. Crypto markets, as expected, reacted swiftly, with Bitcoin jumping over 4% and breaking past the $62,000 level. The broader cryptocurrency market followed, with Ethereum, Solana, and others posting gains as investors recalibrated to the Fed‚Äôs more dovish stance.

But while the headlines may paint a picture of optimism, market sentiment remains divided. For some, this rate cut signals the beginning of a new liquidity-driven rally. For others, it raises red flags about the health of the economy.

At first glance, the Fed‚Äôs decision was a boon for risk assets. With the dollar weakening, Bitcoin benefitted as investors sought alternative stores of value. In just a day, Bitcoin crossed the $62K mark for the first time in weeks, while Ethereum hovered around $2,350. But traders are already questioning how long this rally can last.

A significant portion of the crypto market remains unconvinced. Analysts are cautious, noting that the aggressive nature of the rate cut might signal deeper economic concerns. The 50 bps reduction, larger than initially predicted, seems to be an attempt to stay ahead of a potential economic slowdown, with rising unemployment and muted inflation indicating trouble on the horizon.

Despite the positive price movement, questions remain. The $1.6 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options set to expire this week could lead to increased volatility, with a put-to-call ratio suggesting that traders are evenly split between bullish and bearish positions. Bitcoin‚Äôs maximum pain point sits around $58,500, raising the possibility of near-term price declines if the market takes a turn.

Looking ahead, traders are already placing bets on further rate cuts. With the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings scheduled for November and December, expectations are building for an additional reduction by the end of the year. However, the size of the cut remains to be seen. Polymarket, a popular crypto prediction market, indicates high uncertaintly as to the size of the cut. Currently, traders see a 57% chance on a 25bps decrease. This has prompted speculation that Bitcoin could retest its all-time high, but there are also plenty of risks ahead.

Additionally, the timing of the next rate cut is crucial. If the Fed‚Äôs easing aligns with the US presidential election in November, the market could experience heightened volatility. Although pro-crypto stances from candidates like Trump are seen as positive for Bitcoin, uncertainty around the election could still rattle investor confidence.

For now, the market is cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin‚Äôs surge post-cut is encouraging, but it‚Äôs still too early to declare the start of a new bull run. Institutional inflows, buoyed by the growing popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, suggest that long-term sentiment remains positive. However, it‚Äôs clear that many investors are hedging their bets, bracing for potential market turbulence as the year progresses.

Patience will be key in the weeks ahead. The crypto market has always been volatile, and while the Fed‚Äôs rate cut provides a temporary boost, the broader economic picture remains uncertain. Traders will need to keep a close eye on both the macroeconomic landscape and the internal dynamics of the crypto market as the year draws to a close.

In the meantime, the Fed‚Äôs next move will be crucial. With more rate cuts likely on the horizon, the question is whether the crypto market can continue its upward momentum. Otherwise, another period of turbulence is in store.
___
This is just a focus of the current run up set up for a trap for a potential lower low drop. Watching the range here and see what happens after the next pullback to see the next bounce entry for this falling wedge and see if we have any higher highs there after.
___
200EMA is still holding the ground where EMA is not letting the price through. 

Our gameplan here is simple: if we manage to hold this zone until the end of the zone, if we see a rejection happen in 36 hours, then we will see a good downward movement from here. 

But remember, fakeout option is still possible but only if buyers manage to breakout and secure the zone above EMAs.

üìä#BTC reaches the staged resistance zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†We break through the resistance zone, then the resistance zone turns into a support zone. From a structural perspective, a larger bull structure is established, with the ideal target area being 68683-73680. As we said before, if we successfully break through the inflection point of 65175, it means that the weekly adjustment is over and we will start a weekly rise.

‚û°Ô∏èIf we want to participate in new long transactions, we are currently in the phased resistance zone and chasing the rise is impossible. If we can return to the neckline buying zone and the yellow support zone, we can consider it.

‚ö†Ô∏èIf we go straight up without a pullback from here, the neckline buy zone and support zone are invalid‚ùå

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. Some days ago price declined to the resistance level, which coincided with the resistance zone, and at once rebounded up to the trend line. After this, BTC turned around and made a strong impulse down, breaking 63900 with 53200 levels, but soon turned around again and rose higher than the 53200 level, making a fake breakout of it. Next, the price started to grow and later it grew almost to a resistance level, where it some time traded. Then the price rose to the resistance zone, where it touched the trend line one more time and then started to decline. In a short time, BTC fell to the support level, which coincided with the support zone, and a not long time ago it rebounded and started to move up. So, in my mind, I expect that BTCUSDT will make little correction movement and continue to grow to the trend line. For this case, I set two goals, first at the - 57400 points, and second at the 60600 points, which coincides with the trend line. If you like my analytics you may support me with your like/comment ‚ù§Ô∏è

I am aware that BTC is totally bullish on MTFs ( Monthly, Weekly, Daily ) but I will not be surprised if bearish momentum kick in upcoming days when ( if ) price reaches to Daily POIs which marked on the chart. $62.700 - $65.000 and $67.000 - $70.100 are two good supply zones to look for sells targeting down to $48.800 min.

On the other hand, we examined Dominance Tether in this analysis and talked about the fact that nothing special has happened yet because Dominance Tether is still on its support.

The Chuseok holiday in Korea is until September 18th.
As a result, it is difficult to publish ideas.
I hope you have a healthy and happy holiday.

------------------------------------------



It seems that funds are flowing into the coin market through USDT or USDC.


We need to check if the USDT dominance can fall below 5.55.

If not, the key is whether it can meet resistance near 5.89.

-

Looking at the NAS100USD chart, it rose to the important point of 19582.6.

The key is whether it can rise above 19582.6 and receive support.

If not, we need to check whether it can receive support near 19143.2 in the first round.

-------------------------------

** Information on support and resistance zones is explained in the previous idea.

(BTCUSDT 1D chart)

I think this volatility period has just begun because it was set on the 1W chart.

This volatility period is expected to continue until September 29, so caution is required when trading.

-
It is rising near 60672.0-61099.25.

The important thing now is whether the price can be maintained above the M-Signal indicator on the 1W chart.

To do so, the key is whether it can rise above 61099.25 and receive support.

-
Since the StochRSI indicator has changed its slope in the overbought zone, it appears to be currently forming a high point.

Therefore, even if the price rises, a pullback pattern may occur, so we need to think about a response plan for this.

Therefore, whether there is support around 60672.0-61099.25 has become important.

Since the sell line of the superTrend indicator is formed around 60672.0, it highlights the importance of the 60672.0-61099.25 range.

-
If a pullback pattern is shown, the key is whether it can receive support around the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator and rise.

Accordingly, we need to check whether the price can be maintained above 57889.10.

-
If it rises above 61099.25, it is important to see whether it can break through the 63118.62-64000.0 range.

If it fails to break through, it will form a high point and fall like after July 15.

At this time, if the price is maintained above the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator, there is a high possibility that it will turn into an upward trend.

-
I am talking about analyzing the BTCUSDT chart with several charts.

This is because I think that the fund flow in the coin market can be briefly judged by the movement of USDT, USDC and the flow of the stock market according to the launch of the ETF.

I think that it can be used to check whether the current support and resistance zone of BTC is supported based on the identified fund flow.


I think the Renko chart that I sometimes show you is excellent for checking support and resistance zones and trends.

However, since it is difficult to trade through the Renko chart, I think it is good to use it for checking trends or support and resistance zones.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin when it rises above 29K.

The section that is expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41

4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.

Hello, guys, It is observed that price is traded within a band (blue channel) forming a pattern known as the bullish flag which is  highlighted (green) pole and a trading channel (blue).
This present a massive opportunity as this chart structure indicates a prospective price rise of about 70%.
This also aligns with the other fundamentals like the US elections in November as usually market makers will take  position before significant events.

The idea is to buy at the lower troughs of the blue channel while expecting a price break-out to about $88,000

ACTION PLAN
61200-64200 -- BUY
60800 -56500 --WAIT/ DO NOTHING
BELOW 56000 --SELL

However, this trade idea gives a risk reward ratio of 8.9.

Good luck to you

Hello everyone!

  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  We can see that the recent decline is continuing, which is consistent with the breakout from the bullish channel that I outlined earlier.

Therefore, today I will focus on selling and targeting lower profit levels.
___
After the long and short played out exactly as I thought. Can we now look further into an outbreak? Whether this is downwards or upwards, it does not matter. I think from experience that if we close a 4 hour candle below the 59656.7 level. that you are more likely to make a move down. If we close a 4-hour candle above the 60366.2 level, I expect that there is a greater chance that we will go higher. The last option is that we continue to move sideways. However, I think it is less likely that a long or short at the same level entails a greater risk. That's why I'm waiting for myself or one of the moves I just mentioned.

I leave it to the market to determine what the price will do.

According to on-chain data, approximately 8.7 million BTC have been accumulated over the past 222 days. 
ETFs have also been buying and selling, but the total volume of sales is very small compared to the amount purchased. 
Moreover, investor sentiment is currently extremely low, with no new participants in the market. 
--> This has nearly confirmed a local sentiment bottom. You should seize this opportunity and consider long-term investment. 
If the analysis doesn't go as predicted, I will update the percentage for stop-loss adjustments so that you can buy more at better prices immediately. Of course, I never plan to sell all of my BTC holdings. Hopefully, we will reach the target price of 106K this year.
I advise you to break up your orders. 
For example, if you plan to buy $100,000 worth of BTC, divide it into three parts: one part at the current price, one part when the price breaks out of the green box with high volume, and one part when the price drops to the 50K-53K range. Best of luck to us in hitting our target price in the next two months.

Bitcoin is preparing a new drop, probably till the $52.500/$53.500 area. The next big resistance area with short liquidity, is at $61.600/$61.900. Here I think we will see a powerful reversal pattern that will lead to a 6.000/7000 USD drop. Otherwise, if price will not touch that resistance, we will go down directly, but I don't think so.

Assalamu Alaikum and Good Morning to All My Brothers and Sisters,

Alhamdulillah, once again, my prediction for Bitcoin's movement has been spot-on (as shown in the blue circles). In my previous analysis, I outlined key support and resistance levels, and Bitcoin's price has followed this path perfectly. We are now approaching the next significant yellow zone near 64K.

 What's Next?
Bitcoin is expected to complete its current wave around 63,600, with the next major resistance zone starting at 64,500 and a stronger barrier at 64,800. I anticipate some consolidation in this zone, which could provide a healthy environment for altcoins to rally. A brief retracement may occur on the 4-hour or daily timeframe before Bitcoin resumes its bullish trend.

 Bearish Scenario:
Although the bearish outlook is less likely, we should always be prepared for sudden moves. A significant bearish trigger would be a breakdown of the yellow zone below 60,300. However, as long as we hold above this level, Bitcoin remains in a healthy uptrend.

 Altcoin Market:
Altcoins are mirroring Bitcoin's strength, moving upward as Bitcoin surges. Many of our signals have already hit their first and second Take Profit levels, with others performing well too. I continue to monitor and update my signal list with new opportunities.

Stay tuned, and I wish you all a profitable week ahead. May we all find success in these markets. Have a great day!

According to the resistance in the range of 62920 after the failure, we can expect the range of 64900 and 66800 to continue to rise. Otherwise, after breaking the support in the range of 60732, it can be expected to continue falling to the range of 58340 and 55800.

WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

OBVIUSLY, it's not confirmed, but the price is printing a pretty nice moviment in the chart.
___
Just as predicted, #BTC started to drop from the identified zone and crossed below the trendline. Over the past 24 hours, it has dropped by 5% so far.

The first stop for this dump is probably in 55,000 - 56,000 zone.
___
- The price has been gradually declining since March, retesting each of the uptrend channels it has been consistently using.
 - After completing the 2nd retest at $70K, the price dropped to $49K.
 - In fact, 3 days ago, the price tested the lowest of these 3 parallel uptrend channels exactly at $60,600, thus completing the 4th retest.
 - The price, which dropped to  GETTEX:49K  after the 2nd retest zone, is forming a diamond pattern. You can see this in the red lines. This is another reason for the downtrend."

Key Points:

  Retests: The price has been retesting previous support levels (uptrend channels) multiple times.
  Diamond Pattern: The price is forming a diamond pattern, which is often considered a bearish reversal signal.
  Downtrend: Overall, the analysis indicates a strong downward trend in the price.

Bitcoin has broken the falling trend channel in the short term and reacted strongly up. For the time being, it is difficult to say anything about the future trend direction. The currency is approaching support at 58000 points, which may give a positive reaction. However, a break downwards through 58000 points will be a negative signal. The currency is assessed as technically neutral for the short term.

Hello friends,

For hours  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  moves near the VAH. I think BTC is ready for a big move to 61500 and even more.

Right now there is no entry for taking Long position but in case  BINANCE:BTCUSDT   reach the VAL and Volume increased, then I say it is a good opportunity to open Long position.

Be careful guys, Opening position in this scenario is risky.

It seems that Bit is trying to reach 64,400 according to the black path, but it has left a debt at 53,000 and 54,000, and it will probably return to that number, now it remains to be seen when it will decide to return.
___
We will see the MM's intention today as they have held prices somewhat flat in response to recent news. I think we may get a continuation up today. They have taken the lower liquidity and even had a lot of time to accumulate so I think a potential strong move up may be in store but as always watch for early shakeouts.
___
Good news today, ladies and gentlemen! The Fed has dropped interest rates by 50 basis points, which is exactly what we were hoping for. The market has reacted positively, and Bitcoin is climbing, currently at $61,831. We're looking for Bitcoin to close above this support line of $61,689.00 and if it bounces from here, we could face resistance at $62,905. Further up, there's strong resistance around $64,630. However, I believe we'll top out near $62,905, as we need to wait a few days after the Fed's rate cut to see how the market truly responds. By Friday or Monday, we should have a clearer picture of the market's direction. Right now, everything looks bullish‚Äîcongratulations, everyone!

When it comes to operating with crypto, choosing the right exchange can either make or break your trading experience. 

A good exchange isn't only about flashy interfaces or wide coin selections. First of all, it's about security, reliability, and fees that won't drain your wallet. With countless platforms competing for attention, understanding what sets one apart from the others is crucial for both newcomers and seasoned traders.

In this review, we'll dive deep into  WhiteBIT , one of the leading european crypto exchanges, exploring its standout features and assessing whether it deserves a spot in your crypto toolkit.


 TL;DR 
 
 WhiteBIT  is one of the largest European cryptocurrency exchanges. It is used by 4 million users daily, while its daily trading volume counts up to $2.5 billion. WhiteBIT is an official partner of FC Barcelona and Trabzonspor, as well as a donor for a range of charitable initiatives. 
 WhiteBIT stands out for its top-notch security, advanced trading options, swift user interface, and low futures trading fees.
 By contrast, WhiteBIT lacks deposit options for certain fiat currencies. 
 WhiteBIT is a home for many self-sustainable products ‚Äì  Whitechain  network,  WhiteBIT Coin ,  Whitepool , and more. All of them deliver benefits for the users. 
 


 WhiteBIT: brief introduction 

WhiteBIT is one of the largest European centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX). Established in 2018, it has quickly gained the bright spot in the sector, with 4 million daily users and daily volume of $2.5 billion as of today. It was founded in Kharkiv, Ukraine by company‚Äôs CEO Volodymyr Nosov. 

Apart from cryptocurrency exchange, WhiteBIT takes over a complex ecosystem of technical features and products. The centrepiece of it is  WhiteBIT Coin (WBT)  ‚Äì a native token of WhiteBIT, owning of which open a wide range of advantages ‚Äì from commission discounts to free security checks. 

Crucially, WhiteBIT is renowned for its charitable contributions. Case in point:  purchase of the Eurovision microphone trophy  at 2022 auction for $900,000. The funds eventually went to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Apart from this, WhiteBIT and Volodymyr Nosov took part in numerous voluntary initiatives.

WhiteBIT is the official cryptocurrency partner of  FC Barcelona , as well as  Trabzonspor  football club,  Faceit ,  TradingView , and other global companies. 

It is worth noting that WhiteBIT stands out by its robust security measures, as verified by Hacken.io  CER.live  rating.


 WhiteBIT Pros  

- High-end Security
First things first, WhiteBIT is massively renowned for its top-notch security level, distinguished by  Hacken.io  audits,  CER.live  rating, and cybersecurity experts. The exchange stores 96% of digital assets on cold wallets and uses Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block hacker attacks. Letting alone the multi-signature access system as a second-layer precaution for cold wallets and an insurance fund to protect users‚Äô funds.

WhiteBIT‚Äôs robustness is primarily achieved by a complex exchange‚Äôs infrastructure that merges a wide array of user security features and sharp anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.

For starters, WhiteBIT users are enabled with  two-factor authentication (2FA)  ‚Äì a technology that protects the account from unauthorized access. In WhiteBIT, it can be activated via a comprehensive list of 2FA utilities to choose from ‚Äì all to ensure user‚Äôs comprehensive control over the balance and information. 

Apart from a common 2FA, WhiteBIT provides customers with reliable anti-phishing measures. The exchange allows users to add their own anti-phishing code, which will be attached to any emails you receive from WhiteBIT, to distinguish the credible messages from a potential threat. 

What is more, users can manage the addresses for withdrawals on WhiteBIT. Simply put, the function allows to create a personalised whitelist of white addresses or, vice versa, flag the suspicious ones to restrict insecure transactions. To note ones, WhiteBIT customers may require an  address check for criminal involvement  for a fee of 1 USDT. For the holders of  WhiteBIT Coin , the exchange offers free daily AML checks. 

As for the AML precautions, WhiteBIT assures its strict compliance with global anti-money laundering policies. This can be proven by numerous cases of WhiteBIT‚Äôs AML department taking security actions in favour of third-party companies. Namely, in October 2023, the company managed to  track down and freeze  over 445,000 XRP tokens, stolen from Coins.ph crypto exchange. Earlier that year, WhiteBIT‚Äôs AML department  had spotted suspicious activity on the wallets of Chris Larsen , Ripple‚Äôs executive chairman and co-founder, informing XRP Ledger about the potential exploit.

On top of all, you can trade on WhiteBIT only if you successfully pass Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification. Otherwise, users are limited to demo-tokens, which offer a deep look into WhiteBIT‚Äôs functions. 


- User-friendly interface
First look at WhiteBIT reveals its intuitive interface. Its clear layout and smart, logic framework, combined with swift functionality, makes it easy to understand for the newbies and comfortable to operate with for the pros. 

Crucially, the user interface allows users to navigate through the services directly from the headout, while clear layout and minimalistic visualization facilitates the process of choosing the function you need. The most popular ones are highlighted with specific buttons as a way of shortcut. 

What‚Äôs catchy, WhiteBIT‚Äôs UI does not overcomplicate the experience, but implies minimalistic framework to avoid ‚Äòlittering‚Äô with piles of news, updates, and functions. Instead, the latter ones are distributed via the page clearly. 

Importantly, WhiteBIT developers seem to understand that its users are foremostly seeking service. Hence, the website does not jump right away into promoting benefits as a majority of the landing pages do, but puts utility in the forefront. 


 Advanced trading terminal and leverage 

The benefits of WhiteBIT‚Äôs smart interface unfold at the trading features. 

First and foremost, the exchange allows you to  convert  the funds at one fell swoop, with no need to use a trading terminal. All a user has to do is to choose from a wide list of currencies and enter the needed amount. This function suits best for HODLers and users who are not participated in a regular trading. 

These very users can further send the funds via the easier way ‚Äì through  WB codes  ‚Äì without extra network fees.

For more seasoned market surfers, WhiteBIT tried its best to smooth out this complicated endeavour. 

Its  trading terminal  offers wide customisation options ‚Äì from choosing between light and dark themes to order books positions and performance limitations for less powerful software. What is more, it can boast of an editor mode, which allows users to move and replace the elements of terminal wherever they are comfortable with. 

The part and parcel of WhiteBIT trading terminal is a wide integration with TradingView interface, which offers a full array of tools and indicators, which defaultly require paid subscription, for free. Hence, users would not even need to switch platforms to carry out the trend analysis. 

Same features also apply both to  margin  and  futures  terminals. Consequently, WhiteBIT offers reasonable  leverage rates  for those trading options ‚Äì 10x for margin and 100x for futures. The leverage can be easily changed in a separate menu, in which you‚Äôll be kindly warned of the collateral risks. 

However, WhiteBIT is not limited to the basic trading options. The exchange offers  Competition  ‚Äì exchange‚Äôs feature that allows users to participate in games against other traders and win cryptocurrencies. You‚Äôll be matched with traders of similar expertise, and you‚Äôll race against them to trade more assets, reach a certain earnings threshold, etc. Such gamification brings fresh excitement to the platform.

Given a large number of the available assets and a wide array of trading opportunities, it could become difficult to carry out a thorough monitoring of the trading balance. Gladly, WhiteBIT solves this problem with its one-of-a-kind  analytical dashboard . In it, users will receive a detailed outlook on profit and loss, equity trend, and portfolio performance in any chronological order possible.


 Supported currencies  

WhiteBIT offers over  270 cryptocurrencies  for trading. Users can choose from over  520 trading pairs  available ‚Äì with the market cornerstones, such as Bitcoin or Ether, as well as with the prominent Web3 projects‚Äô tokens, like Celestia (TIA) or Hedera (HBAR). Not to mention a wide range of stable coins i.e. USDT and USDC and fiat currencies ‚Äì from euro and U.S. dollar to Turkish lira (TLY) and Polish zloty (PLN). 

What is more, WhiteBIT is keen on the constant updates. Namely, the exchange was one of the first ones to list Toncoin (TON) and DOGS (DOGS) ‚Äì prominent Telegram-based tokens.


 Extensive Income Options 

Besides traditional crypto trading, WhiteBIT offers several other ways for people to access crypto funds. Namely, users can stake cryptocurrencies and earn rewards via various holding plans. The  Crypto Lending  (as it‚Äôs known for WhiteBIT users) offers an array of opportunities and rates not only with Bitcoin or Ether, but also with altcoins ‚Äì Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), or even Dogecoin (DOGE). 

The exchange fosters the community as well. For active participants, WhiteBIT maintains a  referral program , allowing for up to 50% returns from the exchange fees. For businesses and influencers, the exchange recently launched an  affiliate program , which delivers higher return rates, support for creators, and advanced analytical dashboard.

It is also essential to mention  WhiteBIT Launchpad , which kickstarted many prominent projects while allowing users to invest in tokens way lower their actual price. 


 Cons of WhiteBIT 

 Geographic restrictions 

While WhiteBIT is widely-available globally, there are certain countries and territories, residents of which are restricted from using the exchange. Among ones are:

 
 USA
 Afghanistan
 Iran
 Belarus 
 Russia
 Yemen
 Libya 
 State of Palestine
 Puerto Rico 
 Somalia 
 North Korea
 Syria
 Canada 
 United Kingdom
 Trinidad and Tobago 
 Nicaragua
 Venezuela
 Myanmar
 

Also, WhiteBIT is restricted in globally unrecognized or partially-recognized territories ‚Äì Transnistria, temporarily occupied Georgian territories, the Turkish Republic of Nothern Cyprus, Western Sahara, the Federal Republic of Ambazonia, Kosovo, and temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. 

While this list is way lesser compared to the countries where WhiteBIT is available, such restrictions still make sense, as they demonstrate company‚Äôs compliance with the standards of international law. 


 Relative newness 

One potential drawback of WhiteBIT is its relative newness in the crypto market. Usually, the fresh platforms may come with certain risks.

The lack of an established track record means there‚Äôs less historical data to evaluate its long-term performance. Traders may be hesitant to commit large volumes of funds to an exchange that hasn‚Äôt yet proven itself through market fluctuations or stress-tested its systems during high-demand periods.

However, since its launch in 2018, WhiteBIT managed to set foot in the door with robust security, established trust from users, and in the market overall. Letting alone the constant development of the new products and growth of trading volume. Namely, WhiteBIT  gained  third position in terms of derivatives trading volume. 


 Withdrawal limitations for certain fiat currencies 

Indeed, WhiteBIT can boast of a great amount of withdrawal options ‚Äì from SEPA transfers and integration with third-party payment services to different networks and protocols. However, this does not apply to a full list of fiat currencies represented on the exchange.

Case in point: Czech users can only withdraw korunas to bank cards, while Ukrainians and Turks are limited to GeoPay and other similar providers of their national currencies‚Äô payments. 

By contrast, WhiteBIT compensates such minor drawbacks with internal peer-to-peer (P2P) service, which allows for a swifter swap and withdrawal. 


 WhiteBIT fees 

 Fees  is one of the core criteria for traders in choosing the cryptocurrency exchange. Having said that, WhiteBIT offers a competitive outlook in terms of fees. 

Specifically, both the maker and taker are  commissioned  0.1% when choosing spot trading, which is a rather standard rate. Importantly, ones can be reduced for the  WBT  holders. 

As for the futures trading, the taker fee is 0.035%, while the maker one is only 0.01%. This is a significantly lower rate compared to a majority of leading exchanges, such as Binance that has 0.05% taker fees and 0.02% maker fees for regular traders. 

Importantly, the fees for withdrawals differ between the currencies. The good part is ‚Äì a majority of blockchain-based transactions are commission-free. 


 WhiteBIT ecosystem features  

There is more to WhiteBIT than cryptocurrency exchange. In fact, the company is branching the service with technological features, client-oriented initiatives, and self-sustainable products, which combined shape a complex ecosystem. 

All the features of this ecosystem, as reported by WhiteBIT, create exclusive benefits for the users and bridging the gap towards vaster cryptocurrency adoption. 


 Whitechain and WB Soul 

Formerly WB Network,  Whitechain  is an EMV-compatible layer 1 blockchain that operates upon Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, ensuring the verified transaction validators. 

Primarily, Whitechain was designed to reduce commissions for WhiteBIT exchange users and accelerate transaction processing. However, the network also comes with different methods of fostering the users.

One of such is  WB Soul  ‚Äì an unalterable and non-transferable NFT that allows users to recreate their identity within the blockchain without revealing any personal data. From owning WB Soul, users with  WBT  in Holding are able to get rewards for blockchain fees and funds redistribution. 

Whitechain‚Äôs roadmap includes launching new products, enhancing liquidity, enabling cross-chain swaps, and integrating artificial intelligence with smart contracts. The plans are already leaving the papers, specifically with the recent launch of  PocketRocket  ‚Äì Whitechain-powered TON-based crypto game.


 Whitepool 

 Whitepool  is a mining pool that aggregates computing power from miners worldwide, providing a cost-effective alternative to solo mining. Apart from the hashrate of over 6300 PH/s, this SHA256-powered pool also offers 0% fee for receiving rewards, automatic balance updates, and 24/7 multilingual customer support, available in English, Ukrainian, Polish, Turkish, and other languages. 

It also offers special programs for VIP-clients, which provides  lowered fees for using the pool, stable rewards for miners with powerful hardware, and other features that are soon to be announced. 


 WhiteBIT-based services 

Apart from the WhiteBIT-integrated features, the company is also a home to different services:
 
 WhiteSwap : a decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by the Ethereum, Tron, and Polygon blockchains. You can swap, farm, and bridge different assets via the service.
 WhiteEX : This feature provides physical cards that can be used to conveniently top up (deposit) funds into your WhiteBIT exchange account.
 WhitePay : A service aimed at businesses, providing tools for cryptocurrency payment processing. This includes solutions like crypto acquiring and point-of-sale (POS) terminals.
 GNCrypto : a global news outlet dedicated to elevating the understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology
 

 How to setup an account on WhiteBIT 

WhiteBIT stands out with its swift yet secure registration process. 

To  set up a WhiteBIT account , you'll need to enter your email address and create a strong password in a Sign Up menu. Finally, find the confirmation message WhiteBIT sent to your email and enter the verification code. 

The next essential step is completing the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification. You need to provide your ID proof along with your address proof. The verification process usually takes a few minutes. 

Now, only when the KYC is completed, you can access all WhiteBIT features.


 Verdict: is WhiteBIT a good trading toolkit? 

After taking a closer look at WhiteBIT, it‚Äôs clear that it brings a lot to the table for crypto traders of all levels. Its robust security measures, competitive fees, and user-oriented approach makes it a strong contender in an increasingly crowded space. 

Still, it‚Äôs essential to weigh these benefits against your own trading needs ‚Äì whether it's access to specific coins, advanced tools, or a mobile-first experience. At the end of the day, the right exchange is the one that best aligns with your goals, and WhiteBIT might just be the platform that gets you there.

Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a critical zone as it struggles to hold above the $57,000 support level. The daily chart suggests that the cryptocurrency is losing momentum, with multiple technical indicators pointing towards a potential bearish breakdown.

### 1. **Price Action and Key Levels:**
   - Bitcoin is currently trading at **57,776 USDT**, down **2.29%** in the latest session. The price has ranged between **59,210 USDT** (high) and **57,493 USDT** (low), reflecting increasing selling pressure.
   - The price has failed to break through the strong resistance around **60,000 USDT**, and the downward sloping trendline indicates that sellers are controlling the market.

### 2. **EMAs Acting as Resistance:**
   - BTC is trading below all key EMAs (20/50/100/200), indicating that the bulls are losing control in both short- and long-term trends. The **20-day EMA** (58,323 USDT) is acting as immediate resistance, followed by the **50-day EMA** (59,523 USDT). The price consistently failing to reclaim these levels reflects persistent bearish sentiment.

### 3. **Descending Trendline Pressure:**
   - A clear **descending trendline** is visible on the chart, connecting recent highs. BTC has been unable to break this trendline, suggesting continued downward pressure and potential for further declines. This trendline acts as a psychological barrier for the bulls, preventing any significant breakout.

### 4. **Support Levels and Bearish Targets:**
   - The key support at **57,000 USDT** is being tested. A break below this level could lead to a sharper decline, with the next major support resting around **49,024 USDT**, which coincides with a previous consolidation zone. Traders should be cautious of a close below this support, as it could signal a prolonged bearish phase.

### 5. **RSI and Momentum:**
   - The **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** is currently at **47.34**, suggesting neutral momentum but edging closer to oversold territory. This indicates that while Bitcoin is not yet in an oversold condition, a continuation of the current trend could push the RSI below **40**, confirming further downside risk.

### 6. **Volume and Market Sentiment:**
   - The **volume** sits at **24.775K**, which is relatively low. This implies that the current move down might not yet have the momentum of a full-scale sell-off, but if selling volume picks up, it could accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs decline towards lower support levels.

---

### **Conclusion:**
Bitcoin is at a crossroads, with key support levels in danger of being breached. If the price fails to hold above **57,000 USDT**, the next target could be **49,024 USDT**. The inability to break through key EMAs and the descending trendline further signals a bearish outlook. Traders should keep an eye on volume and RSI levels to gauge the strength of the selling pressure. A breakdown could signal a prolonged bearish trend, while a bounce from these levels would provide temporary relief.

Hello everyone, let's look at the current BTC situation considering the one hour interval.  In this situation, we can see how the price has moved higher from the local downtrend line above which it remains.
  Let's start by setting goals for the near future, which include:
T1- 60252$
T2- 62340$
T3- 64922$
  Now let's move on to the stop-loss in case the market continues to decline:
  SL1 = $58,076
  SL2 = $56,190
  SL3 = $555,256 AND
  SL4 = $54,044

  Looking at the RSI indicator, we see a movement at the upper limit, which may influence an attempt to recover or give a temporary sideways trend.

BTC double could play out. 

In worst case scenario, BTC will form a double top on M, and then correct back to its major support which is around 33K. 
If BTC did not form double top, rather broke its previous ATH, then there will be a price discovery and we may see a new ATH.
___
Bitcoin is suffering in the daily time frame and it can fall down sharply and reach the limit of 40-48. In the meantime, the dominance of Bitcoin is also falling, which is a sign of stagnation in the altcoin market. Please note that In this case, don't go to them when the coins are pumped because it will be an excuse for your liquidation. The best time to buy bitcoin and altcoins is between 40-48

Please pay special attention to the accurate trend, channels, and very accurate colored levels

___
Current Range: BTC is trading within a significant horizontal range between approximately $52,000 (support) and $68,000-$72,000 (resistance). This range has been respected since March 2024, with several bounces between these levels.

Descending Channel Breakout: Recently, BTC has broken out of a descending channel pattern (marked by the white lines). This breakout suggests a potential shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. If this breakout holds, BTC may see a continuation of upward movement.
 Around $54,000 (near the green trendline), which has acted as a strong support level throughout this range.
The upper boundary of the range near $68,000-$72,000 remains the key level to watch for any potential breakout to the upside.

If BTC continues to hold above the breakout level and gains momentum, the next major resistance will be the upper range boundary near $68,000-$72,000. A successful breakout above this level could potentially target higher levels around $76,000.


If BTC fails to maintain the breakout and falls below the descending channel, we could see a retest of the lower support around $54,000. A break below this level would likely lead to a test of the lower range boundary around $52,000 or even lower levels.
Momentum indicators like RSI or MACD were not included in the chart, but adding these could confirm the breakout's strength.
BTC/USDT shows potential for further upside following the breakout from the descending channel, with key levels to watch at $68,000-$72,000 for resistance and $54,000 as immediate support. As long as BTC maintains above the breakout level, the bias remains bullish, but caution is warranted near the upper boundary of the range.

Clear market structure is very important to trading

We see here that my "interest zone" at 58 k has been a resistance for some time but they have now rocket shipped through it. Can it hold or does the MM have other plans???
___
The price perfectly fulfills my previous idea. It hit target level.  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  in continues to trend downward, showing a lack of buying pressure since the last week of August. The price action has consistently produced lower lows and lower closes. Even on the daily timeframe, we‚Äôre seeing these lower lows, despite a recent false breakout below the July low, with the price hovering around that area once again. Historically, September has been a challenging month for Bitcoin, often showing negative performance. This suggests there is a likelihood of the price moving further down, possibly breaching the 50,000 level and targeting the support zone between 48,000 and 45,000. Should the price reach this area, we could potentially see a strong bounce and the beginning of a new bullish trend. My target is support level at 51220.00



Traders, if you liked this idea or if you have your own opinion about it, write in the comments. I will be glad üë©‚Äçüíª

Bitcoin took a significant hit yesterday, dropping past our initial target zone and finding support at the secondary zone outlined in Plan B.

The purpose of our plan is to identify key levels or zones that serve as strong areas for potential trades. If the Plan B level continues to hold, the price may form a potential leading diagonal, creating a wave structure from 1-5 as highlighted on the chart.

This scenario could push BTC's next target back to the 66k-68k range. This setup allows us to use a tight stop loss just below 56k.
 
It's a volatile market, so we should be prepared for any outcome. Trade safely.

Hello traders and investors! 

For a month, I followed the previous analysis. Now, I‚Äôve decided to create a new one. Let me remind you of the setup. 
Quotes:
 On the 8-hour time frame, a sideways range has also formed. The lower boundary is at 53,485, and the upper boundary is at 71,997.
On the 2-hour timeframe, the seller's vector 8-9 has reached the target of 56078. The volume and delta are conducive to gathering stop losses below the level. The quick recovery by the buyer after the breakout and the candle closing above 56078 increase the likelihood of the price dropping below the local low of 55606. For the buyer's range vector 9-10 to play out (with a potential target of 62745), it would be prudent to accumulate volume and push the price below the local low of 55606. 

In fact, the price followed the assumptions. What‚Äôs next? 

On the daily and 8-hour timeframes, the buyer absorbed the seller's candle and formed a buyer's zone. At the same time, on the 8-hour timeframe, the seller touched the lower boundary of the range at 53,485, from where the buyer resumed. 


On the 2-hour timeframe, the seller manipulated the level of the beginning of the buyer's last impulse (56,078) at point 7 of the range. The price is currently above this level. 


All these factors favor searching for buy opportunities. 

I f the buyer defends 56,078 , potential targets are 
 
 58,519, 59,005, and 62,745, 65000 on the 2-hour timeframe, 
 61,166, 62,198, and 70,079 on the 8-hour timeframe, 
 and 61,166, 62,745, 70,079, and 72,797 on the daily timeframe.
 

Good luck with your trading and investments!

Bitcoin is going to hit $100,000 in 2025... I am going to breakdown how everything will develop in a few minutes.

How are you feeling in this beautiful Saturday/Sunday?

The correction is not yet over. When the correction is over we will have bullish action, of course, but bullish action doesn't mean straight up, it simply means higher highs and higher lows. There will be fluctuations, shakeouts, swings and all types of market moves in-between.

The correction bottom comes in and growth immediately follows for a month or two and then another drop. This drop can end in a higher low or lower low (around November), makes no difference. After this drop we enter the accumulation phase and things will slow down.

While Bitcoin moves slowly, slow and steady growth, these Altcoins that I've been sharing now will have their best period in some 4, 5, 6 years.

December 2024, January and February 2025 Bitcoin will be slow but still higher, moving up, recovering. Full speed starts to develop right after February, at the beginning of March 2025. We can say it will take some time to break resistance, the barriers, and so after March/April 2025 we can see the light and we are now aiming toward $100,000. I don't know if it will hit right on April or May or later down the road, but it will take a while.

In short, Bitcoin is likely to hit $100,000 after March 2025.

All the period before this date the Altcoins will shine. The Altcoins will shine because Bitcoin will be growing slowly, kind of sideways; bullish accumulation/consolidation. It will be obvious that the 2024 corrective phase is a thing of the past and everybody will be preparing for the new All-Time High in the latter part of 2025.

We are likely to get a blow-off top in 2025. Not like 2021 but more like 2017. Remember this.

The numbers are pointing toward 190,000 as the top but we will have to add inflation and God knows about market hype. So it can go to 220,000 if things go great.

If things go bad, for whatever reason, we can peak around 150K.

Sounds good?

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.

TL;DR for Busy Readers

 
 95% confidence that Bitcoin has bottomed at $52.5k, with the worst possible scenario at $50.4k.
 The USDT Dominance Chart is showing resistance levels not seen since the last bear market when Bitcoin was around $27k.
 For Bitcoin to hit $44k, USDT dominance would need to enter bear market territory, which is highly unlikely.
 A 30%+ downside move in USDT dominance suggests more capital will flow into Bitcoin, signaling a bullish uptrend.
 The odds are heavily in favor of Bitcoin moving upward from here, and I expect it to play out over the rest of the month.
 

I‚Äôm 95% confident that we‚Äôve bottomed out at $52.5k, and the worst case scenario would be $50.4k. Additionally, I‚Äôm 95% certain we won‚Äôt see a drop to $44k or anywhere near it. Here‚Äôs why.

 The USDT Dominance Chart: A Key Indicator 
One of the most reliable charts for predicting Bitcoin tops and market reversals is the USDT Dominance chart. This chart tracks the dominance of Tether (USDT) in the market, and right now, it‚Äôs showing levels not seen since the last bear market when Bitcoin was trading around $27k.

Currently, USDT Dominance is at critical resistance, touching levels that are typically only observed during bear markets. Historically, when USDT dominance hits these levels, it signals a bottom for Bitcoin and the beginning of an uptrend.

Additionally, the USDT dominance chart indicates we could see over a 30%+ move to the downside in USDT dominance, meaning more capital will flow out of stablecoins and back into Bitcoin and other cryptos. This is a strong indicator that Bitcoin is bottoming out and preparing for a bullish move.

 Why $44k is Unlikely 
For Bitcoin to drop to $44k, USDT dominance would have to enter territory that we‚Äôve only ever seen in true bear markets. If this happens, it could break the higher timeframe (HTF) structure on both the USDT dominance chart and the Bitcoin chart, and ultimately, we wouldn‚Äôt just stop at $44k‚Äîwe‚Äôd probably end up around $30k.

 That‚Äôs why if you‚Äôre hoping for $44k , you‚Äôre really wishing for a major bear market that could pull Bitcoin down much further. This scenario would mean a shift in the current market structure, which doesn‚Äôt align with the probabilities we‚Äôre seeing.

 Upside Probability is Much Higher 
While there‚Äôs always a chance that USDT dominance could break higher and push the market lower, the probability of this happening is very small in my opinion. Investing is all about probabilities, and when we assess the entire market situation, it‚Äôs clear that the upside is heavily favored right now.

Based on the data, the market structure, and the USDT dominance chart, the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing upward from here is very high. It‚Äôs important to monitor how the market behaves in the coming weeks, but all signs point toward a bullish move.

 My years of experience kind of Opinion 
In summary, the USDT dominance chart is signaling that we‚Äôve likely seen the bottom at $52.5k, and the chances of Bitcoin falling to $44k or lower are extremely slim. If anything, this level of USDT dominance typically indicates that a Bitcoin rally is on the horizon. Stay cautious, but it looks like the market is gearing up for an uptrend. Let's see how the rest of the month plays out, but from where I stand, the upside looks very promising.

As with all investments, there are risks involved, and probability-based analysis may not always result in accurate predictions. Always consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

Buckle up, dear humans. If the stars align, or more accurately, if the charts, whales, and market dynamics align, Bitcoin might indeed be setting its coordinates for the $40,000s. But in the grand cosmic joke that is the market, always be prepared for a plot twist. Here's to hoping your digital wallets are ready for the ride, whether it's to the moon or just a scenic tour around the current orbit.

Hello my dear friends, another weekly session is over and new data becomes available. 
Let's review those in an unbiased way and see what the chart is saying.

‚ûñ The 2-Sept. week just closed at 54,869. This is after being rejected by EMA34.
‚ûñ It is the first time that Bitcoin closes below EMA34 in more than a year.
‚ûñ It is the worst weekly close since Bitcoin moved above 60,000 in February.
‚ûñ It is the worst weekly close, coming out of a major high, since November 2021.

‚ûñ The weekly session also closed below the 0.382 Fib. retracement level relative to the bullish wave that started in September 2023; a major support lost.

‚û¢ Everything is ultra-bearish. 

‚ûñ The weekly session that just closed also ended as a Doji but red. Signaling the continuation of the previous candle. The previous candle was a full red candle.

‚û¢ Everything is so bearish that we need not go any further.

I would love to entertain you more but it would be a waste of time.

All the signals coming from this chart are saying that  Bitcoin is about to crash .

Namaste.

By analyzing the #Bitcoin chart on the weekly timeframe, we can see that over the past two weeks, the price dropped from $65,000 to $52,500 and is currently trading around $54,400. If the price remains below $57,870, we will likely see further declines in Bitcoin. The potential targets for this drop are $50,750, $49,000, and $44,100. After a short corrective wave, we may witness a significant upward move in Bitcoin, with targets above $80,000.

All indicators point to a continued decrease in the price of BTC. Funds are withdrawn from spot ETFs every day, and the mood on the market continues to be short. Looking at the graphs of altcoins, in most cases they are also aimed at continuing the fall. I think that we are in for a strong acceleration, after which a reversal and the beginning of growth is possible.

I consider the range for entering a long position in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã45000-47000

I've reviewed hundreds of coins in the past few days, and I can confidently say ‚Äî they're in a tough spot right now 

The charts have dropped so much that many no longer believe in the success of these coins. As an analyst, I see global descending wedges starting to form ‚Äî a phenomenon I observed before the previous bull market.

As for BTC, I‚Äôm seeing prolonged consolidation with the removal of all levels. Experience tells me that autumn is the "golden time" for crypto, so the BTC fractal might play out, as I‚Äôve shown in detail on the chart.

Hi Everyone 
There is another Short Opportunity for BTC , looks bearish to me 

Best of Luck

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price rose to resistance 2, which coincided with the resistance zone and broke this level. Then it rose a little higher than the resistance zone and some time traded near until it reached the trend line and then BTC started to decline. In a short time price declined to resistance 1, which coincided with one more resistance zone, breaking resistance 2. As well, the price started to trades inside the wedge, where it rebounded from resistance 1 and tried to grow, but failed and soon dropped back. Some time later BTC fell to the resistance zone and at once rebounded to the trend line, which is the resistance line of the wedge also, and then declined to the support line of the wedge, breaking resistance 1. Recently price bounced up to this level and tried to break it, but failed and now trades below. In my mind, BTCUSDT will make a small movement up and then continue to decline to support line of the wedge. Therefore I set my goal at 54800 points. If you like my analytics you may support me with your like/comment ‚ù§Ô∏è

The BTC/USDT daily chart displays a descending channel pattern with a recent test of the lower trendline, indicating a key support area.
The price has recently bounced from the lower boundary near $52,408, showing a potential reversal toward the upper trendline.
The critical support level is highlighted at $52,408. A successful defense of this level could serve as a strong foundation for a bullish move.
The nearest resistance is the descending upper trendline of the channel, currently around $66,000. A breakout above this level could signal the start of a new bullish phase.
Potential Bullish Scenario:

The chart suggests a possible rally from the current levels, with the price potentially moving towards $66,000.
If the price breaks above the channel resistance, it could trigger a larger bullish momentum targeting previous highs or beyond.
Bearish Consideration:

A failure to sustain above $52,408 could lead to a downside continuation towards the next significant support levels around $50,000 or lower.
Monitoring for false breakouts or rejections near the resistance trendline will be essential to manage risk.
Pattern Analysis:

The ongoing consolidation resembles a broadening formation, with increasing volatility at the boundaries of the pattern.
The large upward arrow on the chart indicates a projected move higher, suggesting optimism among traders for a breakout.
Key Takeaways:

A sustained move above the $54,000-$55,000 range with strong volume could validate the bullish scenario.
Positioning should account for both scenarios with stops below $52,000 to mitigate downside risk if the support level fails.
This analysis points towards a cautious optimism for BTC, with critical resistance levels needing to be cleared to confirm a bullish continuation. Keep an eye on the volume and price action around the resistance trendline for further confirmation.

Hello, this is Chartist.

Bitcoin has been in a continuous downtrend since reaching the $65,000 level, without any significant rebound. 

Currently, it has declined by around 19% from its previous high, forming a bottom around the $52,500 level.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has remained in the "extreme fear" range at 22-23 over the past two days, highlighting heightened market anxiety.

Now, the key question is whether Bitcoin can stage a rebound from this point. 

Based on the current technical indicators, I believe there is potential for a recovery.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the analysis.

 < Chart Analysis > 



I‚Äôve used RSI, CCI, and Stochastic indicators on this chart, and all three are showing positive signals after exiting oversold conditions.

1. RSI(Relative Strength Index) : An indicator measuring buying pressure. Currently recovering from oversold levels, signaling a possible price rebound.

2. CCI(Commodity Channel Index) : Used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. It‚Äôs moving out of the oversold zone, which indicates upward momentum.

3. Stochastic : A short-term indicator that predicts price reversals. It‚Äôs recovering from the oversold region, further suggesting the likelihood of a technical rebound.

Typically, when these indicators show recovery, the price tends to move toward the middle line of the Bollinger Bands (the red line on the chart). 

However, since this middle line could serve as resistance, it‚Äôs crucial to monitor how the price reacts upon reaching it.


 < Summary > 

- Bitcoin has dropped from $65,000, establishing a bottom around $52,500. 

- Technical indicators such as RSI, CCI, and Stochastic are all signaling recovery from oversold conditions, indicating a potential rebound. 

- It will be important to watch if the middle line of the Bollinger Bands acts as a resistance level during this rebound.

Best of luck with your investments!

I wasn't even looking at Bitcoin but opened this chart to check some numbers in relation to ETCBTC, which is ultra-bullish right now and what do I see?

Bitcoin just lost ALL support on the weekly timeframe.

There is only the wick from the 5-Aug. week that's been lower since February. Bearish bias, bearish potential, bearish continuation confirmed for the 300th time.

What is happening is nothing new. This is something that has been in the making for the past six months. Bitcoin gave the first massive, impossible to ignore signal on the 5th of March, six months ago, with the highest bearish volume session on the daily timeframe in years.

The action has been bearish, sideways, down, lower highs and lower lows... The chart tells us the tendency, the market will make up the event that will be the catalyst that produces the crash that we've been seeing developing for so long.

‚ûñ What to make of this situation?
‚ûñ Where do go we from here?
‚ûñ What about Crypto?

This is a positive situation. We are seeing the natural workings of the market first hand. The market grows and shrinks. Money flowing out of Bitcoin will reach other portions of the market and all is well. Everything is as it should be and life is good.

From here, we move to the Altcoins. We enjoy the Altcoins and profit from their rise as Bitcoin crashes. When Bitcoin hits bottom, we can either move back to Bitcoin or continue with the Altcoins, but, when the bottom is hit, the opportunity to buy again presents itself. Better prices, more people, new participants will join. All the gambling, all the weak-hands, all these things will be "corrected," erased, removed from the market and only those that are ready for the long-term will stay in the game. This is again positive, there has always been corrections and corrections will continue to exist for as long as we humans live in a world of duality with good and bad, night and day, left and right, pleasure and pain. This is exactly what the market does. Energy from the moon (down), energy from the sun (up).

Crypto as a whole is becoming better. Crypto as a whole is evolving. What about Crypto?
Cryptocurrency is doing great and will continue to do great. The Cryptocurrency market is evolving and will continue to evolve.

Think of the 2022 bear-market. When Bitcoin crashes, everything crashes. Bitcoin would only hint at moving lower and everything would be down 20-30%. Now we are seeing the lowest prices in months and many pairs are staying strong, ready to move ahead.

Imagine billions upon billions moving from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin, Tron and the rest, to the smaller Altcoins, what do you think will happen? A major bullish wave.

So, when one side of the market is depressed, the other side can grow. We are here, we are adults, we are advanced, we are smart; we can see this dynamic and instead of letting our Bitcoins lose value, we can take action and profit all day long.

‚ûñ What action to take now?
‚ûñ How to survive the correction?

Sell the pairs that are trading high. High can be those trading near March 2024 prices or February 2024 or near their recent peak. Those are no good, for now. Sell those.

Buy those trading low. Low can be those trading near a strong support. Can be a support that is 1 year old, 2-3 years old, etc.

Buy those trading at All-Time Lows or those trading near their October/September 2023 low/support. These are good now and set to grow.

The Tether (USDT) pairs are risky no matter how they look. They will crash when Bitcoin crashes. Period.

The Bitcoin (BTC) pairs are the only way to succeed at this point. Plenty of time we had to take action, plenty of time to prepare. There is still time now because, while Bitcoin has been going down, some of these Altcoins, most of them, are still at their lowest level in 3,4,5 or 6 years; it can't get any better than this. These will grow long-term and it will be a win-win-win.

‚ûñ What happens if you are wrong?

This is not financial advice.

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Namaste.

hello guys.

 Range-Bound Market:  Price is moving within a range, with resistance at $66,813.59 and support around $56,200-$54,650.

 Upside and Downside Hunting:  Failed breakout attempts suggest a potential liquidity grab; price may dip below the current range (downside hunting) before reversing.

 Key Levels:
Resistance: $66,813.59
Support: $56,200 - $54,650 

Outlook:  Short-term bearish with a potential reversal from lower support zones.  Watch for a breakout above the range.

Analyzing the Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) 4-hour chart gives a clear view of the market's recent activities and provides insight into potential future movements:

Overview of Current Market Conditions:

Bitcoin is currently trading around $56,590, following a significant downtrend from its recent highs. This movement has positioned Bitcoin just above a major support level at $54,319.86 (S1), which is critical to watch in the short term.
Support and Resistance Levels:

Immediate resistance is identified at $58,672.95 (R1). This level could act as a short-term barrier for any upward movements. Further resistance is seen at $65,731.15 (R2) and $70,387.98 (R3), which align with previous price consolidation zones and peaks.
Key support levels are $54,319.86 (S1) and a more substantial base at $48,745.21 (S2). These levels could potentially hold further price declines if the current support fails.
Technical Indicators:

The MACD is currently below the signal line and hovering near zero, indicating a weak momentum and a bearish market stance. This suggests that there might be continued downward pressure or consolidation in the near term.
The RSI is at 43.44, which is neither in the oversold nor overbought territory. However, it leans towards a bearish sentiment, aligning with the MACD's indications.
Trading Strategy:

Given Bitcoin's proximity to the $54,319.86 support level (S1), my immediate strategy would be to monitor this level closely. A bounce off this support with increased volume could signal a potential buying opportunity, targeting the first resistance at $58,672.95 (R1). Conversely, a break below this support could see Bitcoin testing the next major support at $48,745.21 (S2), presenting a short position opportunity.
Entering a trade, I would place a stop-loss just below $54,000 for long positions, to mitigate risk in case of a sudden downturn. For short positions, a stop just above $54,500 after confirming a breakdown would be prudent.
Risk Management:

Considering the volatile nature of Bitcoin, maintaining a strict risk management strategy is crucial. Adjusting stop-loss levels to break-even when prices move favorably can protect gains and reduce potential losses.
Regularly reviewing upcoming economic events and news that may affect market sentiment is also vital, as crypto markets can be highly responsive to such stimuli.
Overall, this analysis aims to leverage technical insights to capitalize on Bitcoin's price movements, balancing between cautious observation and readiness to act on clear market signals.

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Please click "Boost" as well.
Have a nice day today.

-------------------------------------



I think funds are still flowing into the coin market.

Therefore, as long as funds flow into the coin market, the coin market is expected to continue its upward trend.


However, I think that it is necessary to adjust the investment ratio because the trading volume is not the same as before (box section).

-----------------------------------------------

(1D chart)

The horizontal line drawn on the chart indicates the volume profile section.

Therefore, the strongest volume profile section at the current price position is around 58697.01.

In addition, the volume profile section currently being formed is 56843.36, 64179.08.

The PVT indicator is a component of the BW indicator.

Since the PVT is currently in a downward trend, we can see that the downward strength is strong.

Therefore, when it rises above 58697.01, it is important to see whether the PVT turns into an upward trend.

-
(1D chart)

If it receives support near 57889.10, it is highly likely that the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator will turn upward.

Therefore, the key is whether it can receive support near 57889.10 and rise above 59053.55.

However, since the current StochRSI indicator is in the overbought zone and has a change in slope, there is a possibility that it will make a short-term high near 57889.10.

If the StochRSI indicator turns downward this time, whether it will receive support near 56150.01-56950.56 is an important key.

-
(1W chart)

If PVT falls below the dotted line on the 1W chart, there is a high possibility that it will turn into a downtrend.

Therefore, you should check whether it can be supported near 57122.77, which is the lower point of the HA-High indicator box on the 1W chart.

--------------------------------------------

Since the trading period is mostly different, the chart analysis will differ depending on which point you start trading from.

Therefore, the points or sections I mentioned are points or sections that can affect the trend.

I think the point that has the greatest influence on the trend change from the current price position is the 57889.10 point.

In order for the trend change to expand, it must break out of the 56150.01-59053.55 section.

-
From a short-term perspective, it seems that it is currently forming a short-term high.

So, to break above this short term high, it needs to be supported above 59053.55.

-
Have a nice time.

Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

The real uptrend is expected to start after rising above 29K.

The area expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

Bitcoin Growth Perspective up to 65K
 
Currently, BTC is consolidating, and preparing for its next significant move. 
The key resistance level at $59,600 is important for Bitcoin to overcome to gain further upside momentum

 Technical Analysis 
59.600 price level has been identified as a significant resistance point. 
Breaking through this zone could signal a strong bullish trend which can push Bitcoin up to 62500 which corresponds to another stronger zone.

Continued interest from institutional investors can provide the necessary capital inflow to push BTC past these resistance levels.

Positive regulatory developments can boost market confidence, aiding in the upward movement of Bitcoin.

Global economic conditions, including inflation rates and monetary policies, will also play a significant role in Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory.

2 years have passed since the detailed analysis of the bottom of Bitcoin. This is my last analysis of Bitcoin until the price ceiling is reached. In these two years, I tried to make a profit by including my analysis point of view. I personally do not expect Bitcoin to fall and expect I have a one-year bullish move from Bitcoin. The hold is much harder than I thought. In these two years, my hold has affected my psyche. Try not to follow the analysis of others who talk about the fall, because there is no information about They do not have the nature of Bitcoin. I hope that Bitcoin will move according to my analysis like the last two years. This year I will celebrate the 150,000 dollar Bitcoin celebration. Remember that God is with those who are patient. I wish you health, peace and profit. Good luck.

BTC is set for another down trend . watch closely for better sell opportunity if all confirmations hold
___
On a smaller timeframe, we see yet another good start for a potential rejection to happen near 100EMA. 

So far, sellers seem to take dominance near this zone, which is good for us. 

We are looking here for further pressure from sellers and eventually a further downward movement from here!

üÜïIt's certainly concerning to see BlackRock, a financial giant, experience its first outflow from its Bitcoin Trust. This could indeed exert downward pressure on Bitcoin's price, especially in the short term, as it may signal a shift in sentiment among institutional investors.

‚≠êHowever, it's important to consider the broader context. While BlackRock's outflow is notable, other major asset managers are still seeing inflows. Furthermore, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond short-term capital flows.

‚≠êFor instance, developments like the partnership between Merlin Chain and BitcoinOS, aimed at improving network scalability and efficiency, could significantly bolster Bitcoin's long-term prospects. Such advancements have the potential to drive increased demand and adoption.

‚úÖUltimately, while short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, it's crucial to maintain a long-term perspective. Technical analysis, combined with a deep understanding of fundamental factors, can provide valuable insights into Bitcoin's future price movements. The market will ultimately decide, and it's wise to stay informed and adapt to evolving market dynamics

üíéDaily #Bitcoin Analysis
üöÄIn our previous analysis, we predicted a bullish move from the weekly timeframe channel's bottom, which successfully occurred, reaching our initial target of 57877.90‚úÖü§ë

‚ö†Ô∏èAs previously mentioned, this target represents a significant resistance level (daily timeframe pivot: monthly resistance)‚ùóÔ∏è

‚úÖContinuation of the bullish-Trend Scenario:
If the 57877.90 resistance is breached on the daily time-frame, we anticipate further growth towards targets of 63002.85, 66755.85, and ultimately 74537.70üöÄ

‚úÖLower Price Entry Scenario:
Given the strong resistance at the monthly level, a pullback is possible before a breakout.
However, if a correction occurs, we remain bullish and expect #Bitcoin to find support at one of the following levelsüëá
55743.20 (weekly support), 51676.75-52489.40, or 48483.55-50096.10, from which it can resume its upward trajectory towards the aforementioned targets

‚ùåStop-Loss for the Bullish Scenario: Our bullish view would only be invalidated if a weekly candle closes below 49000.00üîªüîª
üîÑIn such a case, we will provide an updated analysisüßê

...............................
üíé#Bitcoin Analysis: ‚è±4-Hour Timeframe

üìåBased on the price touching the daily pivot point (monthly resistance) and the subsequent temporary weakness:

üëâIf the price breaks down on the 4-hour timeframe due to this contact and reaches the support zone of 55059.97 - 55743.20:
üí∞We can use the formation of a head and shoulders pattern to determine the subsequent direction of movement on this timeframe.

‚úÖbullish scenario: If the price reaches the mentioned support zone, bounces, and breaks above the neck-line of the head and shoulders pattern, it confirms a continuation of the uptrend from this area.

‚úÖtemporary bearish scenario: If the 4-hour timeframe breaks below the head and shoulders pattern, it indicates a continuation of the bear-trend towards the second and third support levels of the main analysis. The price is expected to attempt to form a bottom at one of these support levels.


üíé4-Hour Timeframe Analysis(
‚ùóÔ∏èThere is also a possibility of a temporary rally to the resistance zone of 58556.01 - 58936.40, followed by a decline to the support zone of 55059.97 - 55743.20.

‚úÖIn this scenario, the head and shoulders pattern should be drawn with a positive slope, and we would wait for a breakout below the lower boundry or above the upper boundry to signal a temporary decline or a continuation of the growth.

‚ùåThis scenario remains valid until a significant breakout above the monthly #Bitcoin resistance occurs, which would confirm the continuation of the bull-trend from this level on the daily timeframe.

CRYPTOCAP:BTC  remains in a massive consolidation pattern due to the ETF pump, which overheated the market on the 1W timeframe. The MACD has reset, and we are currently in a downtrend.

However, the chart indicates that we may have reached the bottom at 48k, and we‚Äôre starting to see higher lows. The MACD also shows the potential for a cross at 0, which could signal a reversal within 2 to 4 weeks.

A new rising pattern is emerging, which could be the foundation for an uptrend reversal. If the MACD fails to cross at 0, consolidation may continue for another month or two, causing further pain for altcoins.

That said, we also observe a bullish divergence forming, which is another positive signal. Additionally, USDT dominance is at resistance and could be rejected.

In summary:
- Possible MACD 1W cross and reversal
- Emergence of a rising channel pattern
- USDT dominance at resistance
- RSI in oversold territory

These signs suggest that the market has cooled down and may be ready to resume its upward progress.

Let's analyse BTCUSDT in HTF.

Bitcoin is currently trading within a parallel channel on the weekly timeframe. However, a recent breakdown below the channel's midline is a cause for concern, as it could indicate a potential bearish reversal.
If we zoom in, we could see Bitcoin currently trading below the mid-line of the parallel channel on the weekly timeframe. A weekly close above $60,441 is essential for maintaining bullish momentum and targeting $70,000.
However, a rejection from this level could lead to a significant pullback towards $46,000 - $44,000.
Recommendation: It's advisable to consider taking profits on your long positions between $59,000 and $59,500.

Key levels to watch:
- Weekly closing above $60,441
- Booking profits before  GETTEX:59K 
-  GETTEX:46K  to $44k zone if BTC rejects

Bitcoin  started to rise again after  Failing(Fake Break)  to break the  Support zone($58,000-$56,600) .

From the point of view of  Classical Technical Analysis , it seems that Bitcoin has formed a  Falling Wedge Reversal Pattern , and if the  upper line  of this pattern breaks, we can expect a  further increase in Bitcoin .

From the point of view of  Elliott wave theory , Bitcoin's  correction waves  seem to be continuing. The last corrective wave was the  Zigzag Correction(ABC/5-3-5) , which was the  end of wave C ,  $55,600 .

Also, we can see  Regular Divergence(RD+)  between Consecutive Valleys.

A  head and shoulders pattern could form , causing Bitcoin to  decline again  to nearly  $50,000==Two scenarios are possible üëá


I expect  Bitcoin  to move according to the movements  I have outlined in the chart .

 Note: If Bitcoin loses the Support zone($58,000-$56,600), we should expect Bitcoin to fall to $51,000(at least).

Bitcoin has been putting is some near term lower highs and lower lows. 

The daily chart trend is starting to breakdown and show signs of distribution. 

The weekly chart trend is still ok but even if we had a flush to 40k the Weekly chart would still display higher lows. 

The point of this higher low excercise is to define trend and know that trends can often have a large range. 

That being said I think a short setup in BTC is brewing. a retest of the 50 & 100  MA will likely prove to be very strong resistance as we keep losing the key larger term MA's. 

As banks and potentially the stock market lose some momentum its going to be interesting to see how crypto is going to hold up.

Why could Bitcoin easily and quickly reach $100,000 if it breaks out of this sideways trend upwards? But...
 
Using various services like coinglass, it's possible to analyze different metrics, such as the liquidation map.

 What is this and why is it important? 
Liquidations are liquidity, and as we well know, the price moves from liquidity to liquidity. I'm sure you've often noticed how, after sharp and significant drops, the price quickly reacts and reverses. This is the moment when the price finds liquidity through the liquidation of a large number of market participants. In simple terms, it's like a magnet that will eventually attract the price.

 What do we see right now?  According to coinglass, at the $70,000 level alone, there are $20 billion worth of liquidation orders, and the same amount just slightly higher, at $71,500. These are potential liquidations of short-sellers (those betting on the market going down).

  

 What happens when short-sellers are liquidated?  When a short position is liquidated, a buy order is triggered automatically, which in turn pushes the price higher.

This long accumulation + liquidations can easily push the price up to $100,000 or even higher! And this could set the market trend direction for the next 4-6 months.

 But...
 
If you've read the previous post, you know that the current trend is bearish (downward), and until that changes, a further decline is more likely. Importantly, according to coinglass, there‚Äôs a lack of liquidity below, all the way down to the $44,000 - $42,000 range, with a large pool of liquidity and liquidations at the $33,000 level. And where there is no liquidity and it's empty, there are no barriers, meaning the price could drop just as rapidly.

 Additional thoughts: 
 
As long as the downward trend continues, the probability of the price moving lower remains higher. However, since this downtrend has lasted for almost 200 days, there‚Äôs also a significant chance that the trend could reverse, and we could move upwards. So, we are currently in a rather interesting and uncertain spot, where the likelihood of going up or down is about 50/50. I‚Äôll keep following my algorithmic trading systems!

Expecting a move to $140k within 4 weeks once the all time highs are hit
___
Any deviation from the variables outlined here cancels the scenario and requires reassessment.

From $57,000, I expect a correction to the 4-hour imbalance, followed by an impulse up to $61,000-$62,000, where short positions can be considered. The target would be the imbalance likely forming around the $56,000-$57,000 range, from where we could fuel up for a move to $65,000. At $65,000, it's highly probable a short position with a target of $49,000 will be the best option.

However, if during the rise to $65,000, an area of interest forms on the weekly timeframe, I will not enter a short at $65,000 and will wait to see how things unfold with the new variables in mind.

Hi Everyone 
could be some seller come into market , looks bearish for while

Dated today,  PHEMEX:BTCUSDT.P   had dropped 33% from it's All-time High $73851 at 14th March 2024. Despite the overall bearish sentiment in the market, Bitcoin's recent creation of a Higher Low $52500 at 6th September suggests a potential bullish reversal.

Today, we will delve into how the price of BTC might move in the next few days.

 1. Bullish Breakout.  
If Bitcoin can break above its previous high near $65,000, it would signal a strong bullish reversal. Following this, a period of accumulation might occur, to accumulate more buying power before a push towards the next resistance level around $72,000.

 2. Bearish Drop.  
Alternatively, Bitcoin could continue its downward trend, potentially retesting support levels at $50,000 and $41,900. To assess whether these levels offer buying opportunities, consider the trading volume and Relative Strength Index (RSI) during the decline.If the trading volume is lower than it was on August 5th and the RSI is higher, $50,000 might be a good price to buy the dip. However, if the volume is higher and the RSI is lower, $41,900 could be a better choice for buying low.

 3. Consolidation.  
Given the recent volatility, a period of consolidation between $65,000 and $52,500 is possible. This scenario might present opportunities for traders to employ Phemex Neutral Grid bots to profit from price fluctuations.

 Conclusion 
Bitcoin's price action suggests a potential bullish reversal. However, it's important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and technical analysis should be used in conjunction with other factors when making trading decisions. By carefully analyzing the technical indicators and considering potential scenarios, traders can develop informed strategies to navigate the market.

Not much has changed here for Bitcoin, even though we did get a decent move up yesterday back into the range.

What ‚Äúmay‚Äù be important is that Bitcoin has potentially put in it‚Äôs first higher low since the all time high. As you can see, we have had bearish market structure - a series of lower highs and lower lows. This higher low would be conrirmed by a break above $65,000 - the last lower high.

Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Observing the chart, we can see that the price some time ago entered to the range, where it at once reached the top part, which coincided with the resistance level and then dropped. BTC fell to the bottom part of the range, which coincided with the current resistance level, and at once rebounded and started to move up. In a short time, the price reached the 61800 level, and broke it, thereby exiting from the range also. Next, the price made a small movement up, after which turned around and started to decline inside the downward channel, where BTC broke the 61800 level one more time. Later, the price declined to the support line of the channel, and at once rose to the resistance line and continued to move down. Price fell to the 56600 level and broke it, after which made a retest and continued to decline. For this case, I think that Bitcoin can make a small movement up and then continue to decline inside the downward channel. Therefore I set my TP at 51000 points.

___
Current Position: Bitcoin is trading around $58,227, moving within a descending trendline pattern but showing signs of upward momentum as it nears a key horizontal resistance zone between $60,000 and $65,000.

 The major resistance zone is the brown-shaded area between $60,000 and $65,000. A clear breakout above this zone is necessary for a bullish continuation.

 Immediate support is marked by the green descending trendline around $54,000. The next significant support zone is the green area between $43,000 and $46,000, which has historically provided a strong base.

 A breakout above the $65,000 resistance zone could lead to a continuation towards $70,000 and potentially higher levels. Positive momentum indicators would support this scenario.

 If Bitcoin fails to break above the current resistance and faces rejection, it may retest the descending trendline support around $54,000. A drop below this could see Bitcoin revisit the $46,000 support zone or lower.

 Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance zone, and its ability to break through or face rejection will dictate the next significant move. Watch for a decisive move in either direction for confirmation of trend continuation or reversal.

We retested our long POI on very strong momentum caused by SPX flow.

We could look for shorts at a sweep of our local highs around 58.1k, but I'd expect it to overshoot and give us 59.1 or the 59.8-60.6 zone where value got capped a few times in the past weeks.

I'm still not ruling out new lows, but the reaction at this 60k zone will be important to monitor and determine the next few weeks of price action possibly.

Headline & Core Inflation 
13:30 (GMT) see's the release of the atest round of inflation data. The results here are pretty black and white high inflation (over 2.6% YOY for Inflation, over 3.2% for Core Inflation) is bad. End of. 

We need inflation t come down so we can cut the rates.

Heres where any predictions get a bit tricky though. Very good inflation data 2% like 2% or under could mean we get a big rate cut (50bps is a 33% chance atm). That would send the market wild. Coming in at 2.6% / 2.5% will give us a 25bps rate cut - which is bullish but might be priced in to some degree.

 Either way, low inflation good. High infation bad. 
 
Inflation Rate (YOY) 
Predicted = 2.6% Priced In
 <2.6% = Bullish 
>2.6% = Bearish

 Core Inflation Rate (YOY) - Inflation data not including food and fuel. 
Predicted = 3.2% Priced In
<3.2% = Bullish
>3.2% = Bearish

 Technicals 
In terms of the charts I'd say thats an ascending triangle.

Nice little series of higher lows being capped by flat resistance at $57.5k.

Usually a bullish set up, but realistically thats not going to mean alot if inflation is 9%.

 Trading Plan 
What we can say though is that the overhead resistance starting at $57.5 is basically toast if we get a good inflation read so If we get a good read go long.

Targets are not clear but after the immediate cluster theres an old support/resistance at $63.7k so maybe target $60k ($59.9k to be safe) and $63.7k incase we blow through it.

Bad inflation = short. It could be bad but still take incramental profit to be safe at support, so $53.5k, $50k and maybe hold a bit back as we could easily sink much lower.

 Prediction  - 2.6% price pumps to $60k area (I hope!)

This is it, how do you determine bearishness, when the bot you hope will hold is now your top you hope will break, in this case is 58300

This is even reinforced by the break of the major yellow trend which we now find an bear AADI, that is what I call support break resistance, exactly what we see here, A SUPPORT ON THE TRENDLINE, A BREAK OF IT, A REISTANCE ON IT. 

CETERIS PARIBUS THE MARKET SHOULD DROP FASTER THAN YOU CAN BUY. 

CONSIDER THAT TRENDLINE IS UPWARDS SO MORE PRESSURE ON BULLS TO KEEP UP

INVALIDATION IS SUPPORT ON 59400 AND A BREAK FROM THE BLUE DOWNWARD LINES THAT CAN EXPLODE BTC TO ATHs.

If you haven`t sold the BTC top:


Now you need to know that the summer decline in Bitcoin's price, despite multiple ETF filings, can largely be attributed to the massive selling pressure from several key sources like Mt. Gox, Silk Road, FTX, and Germany.

This influx of supply overwhelmed the market, and there simply wasn't enough demand to absorb it. 
I think that the purpose of these ETFs is likely to stabilize Bitcoin rather than drive its price up dramatically. They're designed to bring more legitimacy and structure to the market. 

As for the technical outlook, the current formation of a falling wedge could indicate a short-term price increase. However, the expected retracement suggests that any near-term rally might be temporary. 
Longer term, I think Bitcoin has the potential to break higher, especially with more regulatory clarity and broader adoption. Reaching $80K by the end of the year seems possible, but a lot will depend on macroeconomic factors and the broader risk appetite in the crypto space.

üìä#BTC is still in the selling zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, we are still within the target area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe double bottom bullish structure, and we still need to be alert to the occurrence of a callback before completely breaking through this range.

‚û°Ô∏èIf you want to participate in long trading, you need to wait patiently for the target area to break through. After the target area turns into a support area, you can then look for opportunities to enter the long position in this range.

‚û°Ô∏èIf we fail to break through the target zone and return to the support zone again, then we can consider participating in some new long trades.

üîç Technical analysis:  Ascending diamond pattern 

- According to the  latest analysis presented , Bitcoin made a correction based on the predicted path to the second green box area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe $50,000 correction range.

- In the recent modification, a double zigzag has been formed. The second zigzag is a flat correction.

 According to the formation of an ascending diamond pattern in the green box area, after the failure of the dynamic trigger, the diamond pattern will be confirmed and it can expect to climb up to the specified areas according to the previous analysis.

üíé  Note: Also, if a failure occurs from the bottom of the template, this template is invalid and must be checked and updated again.

The bullrun started in November 2022 - and has been increasing in price ever since.

It has been following the Fib Speed Resistance Fan along the .382 perfectly since then, only briefly dropping below, but never more than 7%... 

I would say, After nearly two years of following this, This is a fairly perfect "Floor" line to follow.

Between March and October 2023, We had 216 days of consolidation before a major pump to the upside, So far, Between March 2024 and today, we have had 191 days of consolidation, Leaving a rough estimate of 25 more days before we could get a major move to the upside (If history repeats)...

We are in a descending parallel channel, Bouncing off the bottom, Once again - Off the .382 Fib Speed fan... We have an Inverse H+S Forming, disguised cleverly, within this channel.

We have formed a beautiful Long term C+H, from the previous Bullrun cycle, with a handle down to  GETTEX:49K , giving us a target of $100k Bitcoin

Everything is bullish here, and it is screaming to let rip. But are you?

(1D chart)

As I mentioned in the idea yesterday, the key is whether it can be supported around 56150.01-56950.56 and rise above the M-Signal indicator on the 1W chart.

Before that, we need to check whether it can rise above the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator and maintain the price by rising above 57889.10.

If it fails to rise above the MS-Signal indicator, it is likely to fall to around 52137.67.

-

The IBIT BTC ETF chart looks a little different in that there is a gap between the MS-Signal indicator and the IBIT indicator.

The location of the StochRSI indicator is also different.

On the BTCUSDT chart, it is just before entering the overbought zone, but on the IBIT chart, it is located near the 50 point.

Therefore, we need to check at what point the StochRSI indicator of the two charts enters the overbought zone and receives support.

-
It is expected that a full-scale volatility period will begin.

Since this volatility period was set on the 1W chart, it is likely to continue until September 29, so caution is required when trading.



If USDT or USDC continues to gap up, it is expected to continue to rise after the volatility period.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin when it rises above 29K.

The range expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.
1st: 43833.05

My dear follower, it is truly my pleasure to be able to share another moment with you. We have many charts, many options to choose from, but nothing creates so much curiosity like Bitcoin. Nothing creates so much anticipation and doubt, as to what will happen next, like Bitcoin. Nothing is more interesting than Bitcoin, because we are all financially involved.

Well, we are not all financially involved... If we are not, we hope to be one day.

Bitcoin is the best invention, the greatest innovation, since the Internet, hot water and baked bread; that's how great this technology really is.

It might sound like joke, funny, but it is the truth. What can be more important than money to a civilization like ours? That needs it everyday in order to exchange, to communicate. What can be more important than virtual money, digital cash, in the age of the Internet?

Everything we do, think, feel or experience now happens through our phones. The way I am communicating with you right now is through technology and a technology that is expanding but was limited, because the money it used was pretty old.

Bitcoin is Internet money.
Bitcoin already changed the world.
This is only the beginning...

Let's read the chart!

The bullish impulse in late 2023 is characterized by green candles only and straight up. There is only one candle that is red. Volume is green as well. This is the 2 weeks timeframe by the way.

Mid-March produces a "doubt" candle. A Doji. Doubt after a major bullish wave.
What is being doubted?

The Japanese who invented this thing call it "uncertainty."
After such strong growth a candle that translates as uncertainty shows up; what is uncertain?

The continuation of the uptrend is what is now longer certain... Sure enough.

After this session, no more growth.
This is beyond TA. No more growth reveals what is happening; no longer growing.

Ok. Volume is rising but the sessions are closing red.
Prices are going down... What should we expect?

I'll tell you what; normally when you are reading these charts you get mixed signals, it becomes hard and confusing. Three signals are pointing up, two signals are pointing down... One indicator is green another is red... I am looking at this chart and wondering; what happened to the bullish signals?

Anyway, the good news is that the crash will happen this same month and in November...

Well, time will tell, but it is getting closer by the day.

Share your opinion in the comments section below.
You've been here for years and years and years, tell what do you see on this chart!

Namaste.

Trying a Long here, if 53K support holds. Touched multiple times so it can be weak. If BTC fails, will look to enter at 44K for a BIG Long.
___
Bitcoin is retesting the old range lows as support, for the second day in a row. Bulls want to see this general level hold.

Many expected significant price action during the debate, which did not really happen. Bitcoin is clearly stuck in the mud in this part of the cycle, waiting for the next big move. The longer we trade sideways, the bigger the next move will be.

BTC - TRENDLINE MUST BE BROKEN TO GO UP (SEP 2024)

___
DISCLAIMER: This is not trade advice. This is for educational and entertainment purposes only to demonstrate how I intend to participate in this market. Trading involves real risk. Do your own due diligence.

People like myself (with average-to-below average intelligence) need a simple strategy. 
My "Ducks in a Barrel" strategy is exactly that. Simple. Clear. Rules Based. Effective. Zero Discretion.

BTC (and several other cryptos, for that matter), are setup for "Ducks in a Barrel" long trades. Lets review the process for identifying these setups. To be clear, this is not a "long now" post. This market is SETUP. This is not a timing tool. We get into the market once we get a technical long TRIGGER on the Daily timeframe. From there, we FOLLOW THROUGH on the trade by managing risk and maximizing profit. Without the TRIGGER, we have not trade.

 STEP 1:  Identify a market with a strong trend on the weekly timeframe. I utilize the 39 and 52 period MA. For uptrends, we want to see both MA's sloping up and pulling away from each other. We see on BTC that the two MA's are still upward sloping and pulling away from each other. This confirms step 1, that we are in a strong uptrend.
 
STEP 2:  We need at least 2 of the following to be in unison with the direction we want to trade (in the case of BTC, we need 2 of these to support the long idea).
VALUATION: For longs, we need an undervaluation vs Gold &/or Treasuries.
STOCHASTIC: For longs, we need to see the market is oversold.
SENTIMENT: For longs, we want to see Bearish advisor sentiment (we fade the public sentiment).

 STEP 3:  We see that BTC is Oversold on the Stochastic and is Undervalued vs Gold & Treasuries. This meets our criteria of 2/3 indicators supporting our idea. This market is now SET UP for longs. Now we wait for the TRIGGER.

 STEP 4:  We are waiting for Step 4 in Bitcoin right now. We need to see an entry TRIGGER on the daily timeframe via one of the following entry techniques.
18 Period MA Entry
10 high 8 close MAC w/ Williams Acc/Dis 57 MA Confirmation Entry
Stop either 150% of 3 Period ATR, or 2 times the width of the MAC, whichever is greater.
There are other entry techniques, but they are higher risk. The two entry techniques above will not catch the absolute bottom, but will ensure that you are buying into a confirmed trend change. Other entry techniques come with the risk of trying to "bottom/top" pick, which increases your odds of several losses prior to the real move occuring.

If you have questions about the "Ducks in a Barrel" strategy, feel free to shoot me a message.

I hope you all have a great week.

And as always.....

Good Luck & Good Trading.

- Macro Overview
Investors have withdrawn over 17,000 BTC, causing the total balance to drop below three million BTC, the lowest level since mid-July. The rise in stablecoin balances indicates investor preparation for upcoming significant economic events. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows reached $117 million, continuing to attract net inflows this week, signaling the potential for notable price volatility.

- Technical Analysis
BTCUSD saw a modest correction, forming higher lows before closing above both EMAs, indicating a shift towards a bullish structure. If BTCUSD extends gains above 58,200, the price could return to the psychological level of 60,000. Meanwhile, if BTCUSD corrects before continuing upward, it may pull back to the 56,500-57,200 range.

The BTC/USDT weekly chart shows Bitcoin currently trading near $54,996, testing a descending trendline and a key horizontal resistance zone between $60,000 and $65,000.
There is a significant support zone between $43,000 and $46,000, which Bitcoin has respected in the past. This zone could serve as a strong base for a potential bounce if tested.

The highlighted resistance zone around $60,000 to $65,000 remains a critical area that Bitcoin needs to break above to confirm a bullish continuation.
The green support zone between $43,000 and $46,000 is the immediate downside target if Bitcoin continues to face selling pressure. Below this level, the ascending trendline offers additional support around the $40,000 level.
Potential Scenarios:

 If Bitcoin can hold above the $55,000 mark and push through the overhead resistance, we could see a rally towards the next psychological level of $70,000 and beyond. The upper arrow on the chart suggests optimism for a potential breakout.
 A failure to hold above current levels might lead to a retest of the lower support zones around $46,000, and potentially lower if market conditions worsen.

A weekly close above $65,000 would provide a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential continuation toward all-time highs.
Monitoring volume and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD on the weekly timeframe could provide early signals of a trend reversal or continuation.

The presence of a descending triangle pattern indicates potential consolidation before a major move. Market sentiment will play a key role in dictating the direction of the next breakout.
Broader market factors, including macroeconomic data and overall crypto market health, will influence BTC's price action.

Traders should watch the key support levels closely and consider stop-loss placements just below the $43,000 zone to manage risk effectively.
It's important to adjust positions based on Bitcoin's price action around these critical zones, especially near major support and resistance levels.
This weekly update provides an overview of the key levels and potential scenarios for BTC/USDT. With Bitcoin currently at a crossroads near important resistance, market participants should closely monitor for breakout or breakdown signals in the coming weeks.

i've used the Bitcoin chart on Binance because data shows me on coingecko it has the highest trading volume. 

**On the Monthly timeframe,**  ,  bearish divergence on the WaveTrend is spotted. even when Using another indicator like the RSI or MACD it will reveals the same divergence. This downward pressure is reflected in the current price action. The Fibonacci retracement from the last Higher Low to the Higher High gives us levels that are often respected; the first orderblock has been mitigated and coincides with an old Monthly level, which triggered an upward reaction. The support line, aligned with the 50 EMA, is a "critical" level that could be tested. Losing this level could cause a drop towards the  GETTEX:25K , it may sound unrealistic but is quite possible, given similar moves in the past and the current macroeconomic times globally. Yes i know its a +60% from ath but go check nov ‚Äò21 till nov ‚Äò22. like Mark Twain would say:  "History does'nt repeat himself but it often rhymes"  my message would be that its something you should keep in mind, just in case. 

**On the Weekly timeframe**,  , the WaveTrend shows that once it moves into the negative, strong upward moves often follow. The Stoch RSI is at low levels, which may create buying pressure. Although volume remains low, but previous price increases have also occurred under low volume conditions. The price still seems to be moving within the broadening wedge, and the support line could be retested. The price targets of the broadening wedge and the potential cup & handle formation are close to each other, though the volume for the cup isn't ideal, but I still want to consider the formation.

**On the Daily timeframe, **https://www.tradingview.com/x/SwOlrpl9 , after the All-Time High (ATH), a clear Change of Character (ChoCh) is visible, with lower highs and lower lows confirming the downtrend. What you're looking for is the break of this downward trend‚Äîthink of an upward break in structure by printing higher highs and higher lows. The previous two highs haven't been tapped yet, so I expect reactions at those levels.

**Conclusion:**
Depending on the support and resistance levels that are tested. Indicators like the WaveTrend and Stoch RSI suggest that a reversal is possible, but I still expect the lower support level to be tested as well. be Looking for the break of this downward trend‚Äîthink of an upward break in structure by printing higher highs and higher lows.

**Resistance levels:**
- $69,000 (a point of resistance)
- $73,777 (ATH)
- $85,300 (bullish TP from broadening wedge)

**Support levels:**
- $48,950 (Fibonacci 0.382)
- $47,000 (Weekly support/FVG)
- $37,330 (bearish TP from broadening wedge)

Greetings traders!

Using inverted charts can be useful to avoid being too biased, and see things from a different prospective.

There's many bears out there that refuse to see a possible BTC bull flag/bullish consolidation.

I bet they won't hesitate to call this a bear flag ready to continue down.
There is a strong horizontal level being retested from beneath, and the price seems to be rejecting.
There is no major higher high, and the price is still capped below the trendline.
Everything points to bearish continuation.

Back to regular chart, it goes without saying, if BTC breaks that trendline and makes new lower low, it would be very, very bearish. For real.

Good luck everyone!

Hey guys. Keep it simple. Here are the major trendlines. We have a bullish "wideing megaphone" pattern formed, in addition to bouncing off the trendlines a higher low has formed. Look for long entries here

10/11 p.m or mayby to 12 i expect to see hiting arround 58 512$ on BTC. And what next? Bounce down but how much. Do we hit 56/56 500 and next little bit of grow before again attack 54K$? Or we go just right now from 58k straight forward to 54k$? I don know im just asking...
___
The color levels are very accurate levels of support and resistance in different time frames.
A strong move requires a correction to major support and we have to wait for their reaction in these areas.
If the BTC chart does not react to close levels, this analysis will be invalid.
So, Please pay special attention to the very accurate trend, colored levels, and you must know that SETUP is very sensitive.

BEST,

The crypto-linked equities industry represents a growing segment of the financial market, offering investors exposure to companies that are directly or indirectly involved in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These equities typically include crypto mining firms, blockchain infrastructure providers, and companies with significant holdings in digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. As the broader cryptocurrency market experiences volatility, these stocks tend to exhibit similar price fluctuations, presenting both opportunities and risks. When comparing these equities, it's essential to consider factors such as their correlation to cryptocurrency prices, regulatory impacts, and the underlying company's financial health and growth potential. The industry continues to evolve rapidly, providing dynamic investment opportunities aligned with the future of digital finance.

___
It continues to look more likely that Bitcoin has put in a higher low at $52,500, although this will not be confirmed until we break above $65,000. There is nothing meaningful on the chart, but it is encouraging to see price back in the range and continuing to head up. 

September is almost halfway over!
___
On a smaller timeframe, Bitcoin is now at the major EMA line, where this is the last zone to get the rejection from.

If everything plays just like we need, we should see a nice rejection from here.

The other scenario would be breaking from 200EMA and forming yet another fakeout like we had before (which would also touch 200EMA on the bigger timeframe of Daily).

Bitcoin Update ‚Äì Monday, 09.09.2024

As-salamu alaykum and Good Morning to All Brothers and Sisters,

This past weekend, #Bitcoin made some impressive moves, but we are still below the first resistance level on the 4-hour timeframe. As the U.S. markets open today, there's a possibility that #Bitcoin could break through this initial resistance and move towards the second one. I've updated the support and resistance levels according to the recent dump, and these lines will help us track the market's next move.

What's Next?

If Bitcoin manages to break through these resistance levels, we could see a solid uptrend forming from this point. However, if it fails to do so, we might experience another pullback. At the moment, we're sitting at the bottom of our designated yellow area, which I believe could act as strong support for now. The price may hold in this zone, but it's crucial to watch closely as the day unfolds.

#Alts (Altcoins)

As I mentioned in my last analysis, I'm waiting for the first resistance breakout before giving any new buy signals for altcoins. Right now, the movement is uncertain, and it's best to remain cautious. I recommend waiting for today's candle to close before making any new entries. Insha‚ÄôAllah, once the market gives us a clearer direction, we can proceed accordingly.

I wish everyone a very profitable and successful week ahead. Stay patient and keep your eyes on the charts!

Hello everyone,

BTC has successfully closed above the $57,273 level, reversing the previous downward trend. This recovery came after a sharp 3.5% drop, which may have caused panic among some investors.

The next crucial resistance level for Bitcoin is $60,863.

Key Points:

Recovery: Bitcoin closed above $57,273.
Previous Drop: A 3.5% decline created market uncertainty.
Next Resistance: $60,863.
Immediate support: $57,273

I also bought from the orange whale index and took my earnings off the purple whale index
It was a place where everyone was able to make a big profit


BTCUSDT - I think it's a section where we're pulling together by breaking through the 1H falling channel upward


In addition, we think that if we break through a certain price range in the future, we can show the possibility of a trend change

It will be a very important position for investors

Based on the analysis of price action and the identified supply and demand zones, BTC/USDT appears to be at a critical juncture with the 50% retracement level acting as a significant resistance. If the price fails to break through this level and encounters selling pressure, a fall towards lower levels is plausible. It is crucial for traders to keep an eye on the behavior around the lower demand zones to gauge the strength of the potential reversal or continuation of the downward trend.

Macro Overview

Easier withdrawal options have kept Bitcoin balances on exchanges stable, signaling investor hesitation near key levels. Miner transfers to exchanges have hit their lowest point of the year, while illiquid supply has increased, reflecting a lack of selling intent. Investors in ARKB are leading the way in spot Bitcoin ETF purchases.

Technical Analysis

BTCUSD corrected to 55,650 before retesting 57,800. The price remains within an upward channel and above both EMAs, indicating continued bullish momentum. If BTCUSD extends its rise beyond 57,800, it may retest the psychological level of 60,000. On the other hand, if BTCUSD pulls back before continuing upward, it may correct to around 56,500.
___
Our gameplan on the weekly timeframe remains the same, and we‚Äôre still hovering around the resistance zone after several tests.

As the price starts to pull away from this zone and sellers gradually take control, we‚Äôre now setting our eyes on the $40K neckline zone. Ideally, this move would bring the RSI into the oversold territory, creating a potential buying opportunity that could push the price towards $50K.

This gameplan will continue to be our guide over the next few months as we monitor how the market behaves.

Bitcoin  has entered September 2024 under pressure, following a broader pattern seen in previous years where the month tends to be bearish for the cryptocurrency. Historically, Bitcoin has faced average declines of about 4-7% in September, often driven by a combination of market sentiment and broader macroeconomic factors, such as changes in U.S. monetary policy.

As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $54,700, reflecting a slight rebound after testing lower levels near $52,950, which aligns with the lower Bollinger Band. The market remains largely cautious, with key indicators reflecting mixed signals:

Bollinger Bands and Volatility: Bitcoin is trading between the lower and middle bands, which shows that while it‚Äôs under bearish pressure, it hasn‚Äôt yet fully broken down. Historically, a move below the lower band often signals oversold conditions, leading to a bounce, and we see the price now holding above $53,000. However, volatility remains high, as shown by the ATR (Average True Range) at 958.80, indicating that the swings in price are likely to remain large, adding to the uncertainty.

 Momentum Indicators: 
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) stands at 39.29, signaling mildly oversold conditions. This level suggests that Bitcoin may not face heavy selling pressure from here unless broader market conditions worsen, but it‚Äôs not low enough to confidently call for a strong rebound either.
The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) remains in bearish territory, with the MACD line at -1,017 and the signal line at -944, indicating that downward momentum is still present but might be slowing. The negative histogram at -72.85 further confirms ongoing selling pressure but suggests it‚Äôs not accelerating.
Parabolic SAR and Stochastic Oscillator: The Parabolic SAR is hovering at $54,988, just above the current price, reinforcing that Bitcoin is still in a short-term downtrend. However, the Stochastic Oscillator at %K: 46.27 and %D: 37.77 is showing early signs of a possible bullish crossover, hinting at a potential recovery if buying interest picks up from these levels.

 Short-Term Outlook 
Given the overall technical setup, Bitcoin appears to be in a consolidation phase after a sharp sell-off earlier in the month. The $52,950 level is acting as strong support, and as long as Bitcoin holds above this, the immediate threat of a more significant breakdown seems to be avoided. However, it needs to reclaim the $55,853 middle Bollinger Band to challenge higher resistance levels, especially the upper band at $58,758, which would signal a shift in momentum.

 Market Sentiment and Broader Trends 
In terms of broader sentiment, the market remains cautious due to ongoing speculation about a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could introduce more volatility. Analysts at Bitfinex have pointed out that a rate cut could trigger a deeper correction to $55,000 or lower, potentially pushing Bitcoin as low as $45,000 in a worst-case scenario.

That said, some analysts, including Rekt Capital, expect Bitcoin to consolidate through the rest of September and potentially break out in late September or October, a historically more favorable month for the cryptocurrency. If Bitcoin can hold support and gain momentum heading into October, there‚Äôs potential for it to reverse its current downtrend and push toward higher levels in the mid-to-high $60,000s, particularly if macroeconomic conditions stabilize.

 Conclusion 
Bitcoin‚Äôs current market behavior reflects its usual September weakness, with mixed technical indicators suggesting a period of consolidation. With a key support zone around $53,000 holding firm, the market appears to be waiting for clearer signals, potentially from economic data or broader risk sentiment. A short-term recovery is possible, especially if Bitcoin can clear the $55,800 level, but traders should remain cautious given the historical volatility and upcoming macroeconomic events.

#Bitcoin Update ‚Äì Wednesday, 11.09.2024

Assalamu Alaikum and good evening to all brothers and sisters,

#Bitcoin has closed the daily candle above our key resistance level marked by the black line on the daily time frame. However, today‚Äôs session has been somewhat bearish. On the 4-hour chart, we can observe that the price has just retested the support line (as shown by the black circle). In my opinion, the price still remains bullish.

What‚Äôs next?
If the price continues to hold within the current resistance zone and stays above support, the bullish trend could remain intact. However, if it breaks below the support level, we may see a reversal in the trend.

#ALTS Update
The altcoin market has shown mixed signals today. While some altcoins are performing well, others have experienced significant drops in line with Bitcoin‚Äôs pullback. Nonetheless, all of our signals in the group are performing well, Alhamdulillah.

I wish you all a very pleasant day ahead! Stay informed and trade wisely.

Bitcoins has not been really moving above the range of  55k-62k  for a longer time now. Also Bitcoin broke below the crucial support at around  58k  and is currently getting rejected from it on the weekly chart.  I think the fed interest rate cut decision will be  extremely important  for Bitcoins midterm future. If the cut isn‚Äôt way higher than the expectations, Bitcoin will drop horribly. The decision could end the current bull market, furthermore because the strength of Bitcoin let loose a lot since the bit higher ATH.  Bitcoin could retrace to 32k-42k . But Bitcoin could also break above the lying above resistances and continue the Bullrun that could finish at  120k in April 2025 .

 Bullrun continuation probability: 60%
Bullrun ending probability 40%

Hello All,

Welcome to the quick update of  BTCUSDT . We have seen BTC touch the levels of $ 52500  and retrace a bit until $ 58000  but couldn't hold it.

We can see it dumping and is currently trading around $56100.

The next levels to watch out for are  $54700 and $53800 . If this holds, we can see BTC pump again and might make a new high in a few months.

 Support levels: $54700. $53900, $49600 in the long run.

Resistance levels: $58027, $61100, $64000, and $72000 in the long run. 

Let's wait and see how this pans out. Until then, stay tuned and trade with caution, ensuring strict  STOPLOSSES !!

In 1980, the Hunt brothers set off a financial earthquake, driving the price of silver from $6 an ounce to a jaw-dropping $50. At their peak, Nelson and William Hunt controlled over a third of the world‚Äôs privately owned silver, igniting a frenzy that reverberated throughout the financial world.

Their story began quietly in the early 1970s. With a vast oil fortune behind them, the Hunts grew increasingly concerned about rising inflation and a faltering U.S. dollar. They saw silver as a reliable investment that could safeguard their wealth and potentially yield enormous profits.

What started as cautious buying quickly escalated into a full-scale market takeover. From 1973 to 1979, the brothers amassed an astonishing 100 million ounces of silver. This massive accumulation sparked a rush among other investors, driving silver prices to unprecedented heights. By January 1980, silver had surged to nearly $50 an ounce, and the Hunts stood at the pinnacle of market power.

But their dominance was short-lived. As their influence grew, regulators took notice and introduced new rules and higher margin requirements. The Hunts, now heavily leveraged and unable to meet these new demands, faced a critical situation. On March 27, 1980‚ÄîSilver Thursday‚Äîthe market crashed, with silver prices plummeting by over 50% in a single day.

The aftermath was catastrophic. The Hunts were forced to liquidate their massive silver holdings, triggering a market panic that led to billions in losses. Once the kings of silver, the brothers found themselves bankrupt and disgraced, their audacious attempt to control the market ending in dramatic failure.

I‚Äôm spotting a reverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart backed by the positive RSI divergence. The key level I‚Äôm watching is $64,000 for a breakout. 
A consolidation above or at this level could lead to a push towards the previous ATH and possibly higher.

Additionally, keep an eye on September 18th, Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decision could significantly influence market. A breakout around this date may provide the momentum needed for a strong move up.

The Cumulative Volume Delta Divergence is an indicator that helps traders visually assess the buying and selling pressures in the market by analyzing volume divergences over time. This indicator overlays directly on the price chart, offering insights into how volume shifts correlate with price movements.

Utility and Trading Benefit
Divergence Detection
The primary utility of this indicator lies in its ability to detect divergences between volume trends and price movements. Such divergences can signal potential price reversals, providing traders with early warnings about shifts in market sentiment.
Enhanced Decision Making
By integrating volume analysis directly with price action on the chart, the indicator aids traders in making more informed decisions regarding entry and exit points. This can be crucial for capitalizing on trends or avoiding potential losses.

Although it is a short rise, the StochRSI indicator is already showing signs of entering the overbought zone.

Accordingly, the key is whether it can maintain the price above the MS-Signal indicator (M-Signal on the 1D chart) while receiving support near 56150.01-56950.56 and rising above 57889.10.

If not,
1st: 54730.0
2nd: 52137.67
You should check for support near the 1st and 2nd above.

Currently, since the M-Signal of the 1W chart > M-Signal of the 1D chart > M-Signal of the 1M chart, we need to check if it can lead to a movement to change the M-Signal of the 1D chart > M-Signal of the 1W chart.

Therefore, if it rises above 57889.10,
1st: 59053.55
2nd: 60672.0-61099.25
You can trade depending on whether there is support near the 1st and 2nd above.

The volatility period will begin soon.

As we pass around September 13 (September 12-14), we need to check in which direction it deviates from the 52137.617-61099.25 range and respond accordingly.



We are always at a crossroads.

I think we need to observe the flow of funds in the coin market to make a clearer choice at this crossroads.

It is not easy for individual investors to know the flow of funds.

We can only briefly understand the flow of funds due to stable coins such as USDT and USDC.

Currently, USDT is sideways, and USDC is gapping up, which is the driving force behind the coin market.

However, I think that USDT needs to gap up for the market to start a real uptrend.

Therefore, we need to think about how to increase the number of coins and tokens corresponding to profits while trading from a short-term perspective for the current uptrend.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after rising above 29K.

The section expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54

4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (when overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

Since I think it can create a new trend in the overshooting section, I need to check the movement when this section is touched.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to create a pull back pattern and start after rising to around 57014.33.

BINANCE:BTCUSDT  is moving downward toward the bottom of the consolidation zone. For context, the market has been oscillating between the 52K and 72K levels since April. Currently, I believe the market may retest the bottom of this zone, especially after it broke and closed below the psychological level at 60K. On the weekly timeframe, we have also broken and closed below the previous week's low, forming a large bearish candle. As a result, I expect the continuation of this bearish momentum. My target is support level 54000.

$BITSTAMP:BTCUSD. Should we be worried or be exited about the price action of #Bitcoin. Looking at the price action of BTC we  can see that there is a lot going on in the market and some traders are really worried about the next move for Bitcoin. So looking at the current price action, we can clearly see that Bitcoin is forming a falling wedge pattern which is a bullish continuation patten, also if we look at the current price level of 53k, we can see that price has been experiencing some rejections at this area. If Bitcoin should bounce off from this price zone, we should see a retest of the 60k area but if fails and breaks below we should see a proper rejection from the 50k area.
Now the question is should we be worried about the 40k which stands as demand zone  which we could definitely see Bitcoin retest that area if it fails to hold support around the 50k level. looking at the price action and the fundamental activities like CPI, UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM  and many more, we should probably expect some huge volatility which either push the price down to 50k or up to 60k levels respectfully.  My suggestion to any who want to invest in Bitcoin or any other Cryptocurrency is for them to wait for proper rejection and support for Bitcoin.

the price is draining energy under fail value zone, Last night Daily candle closed as a low momentum green candle, it means the price is getting required to have a correction to low levels
___
Last week, the price closed below the previous low, forming another lower low. This further confirms that Bitcoin is in a bearish trend, which has been ongoing for the past six months.

The crucial level at the moment is $64,220 (the last formed high). This key level separates us from a bullish (upward) trend. If the price on the weekly timeframe can break this level and close above it, it will be a very important indicator of a trend reversal. Until then, we remain in a bearish trend.

I think bulls want to keep grinding up here, or at least defend 56k region if we retest it.

Going below 55.5-56k, we have some untested npocs, but there is not a lot volume to support price there, so I would wait for 53.6k or 52.5 before considering being a buyer.

If bulls are successful and keep momentum going, I think 60-61k is going to be an interesting area to watch. It has proven to be a pivotal level, with almost no volume traded at 60k but decent HVN right above and right below it.

Bitcoin has reached again the line of 100EMA, where historically we have had pretty good rejections.

Yes, the title is correct.

I anticipate a massive sell off this weekend and by the time you read this post I will already be in the trade. In fact am already in a short from previous Idea this will be a big scale in position.

Briefly put, the bears are in control whether you like it or not. I don't care which side is in control like many of you in the chat, I just want to be on the right side. Long term we bullish but right now we correcting and as such bearish on lower timeframes

Weekly, daily, 4hr and 1hr timeframe are all trending down. Which means the odds are significantly in favor of the bears-We don't get easy markets like this all the time. Its that simple guys. Trade probabilities, why would you want to go against the trend, or rationalized it...that's futile. If the market was to flip bullish, you don't have to ask me twice if am a look for a long, if plan says long then go long.

Now, the bull market is safe as long as we don't break below 26k area. Let me just state that quickly because I see many in Tv chat calling bear market and that's because you guys don't understand market structure and trends properly. Believe it or not all this down movement is just one big correction...until it's not, that's why 26k is important to hold but I don't think we'll fall that low. 47-45k is my prediction for bottom, if that fail then 31k.

Anyways, just wanted to give a bit of context. For this trade:

potential early close at $53500...I doubt here will be enough demand there but its a potential reversal area to monitor.

Main tp is $51500, I will for sure take at least 75% off since it's so close to final tp which is $50,000 where I will fully close the position.

That's the plan given all goes well. The odds are in my favor and checks all the boxes in my trade plan.

I Just now entered short and posting this idea right now. I'll update in the comment if I decide to make any adjustments.

Overall RR to 51500 is roughly 10 RR which would be a fxcking blessing for my accounts.

This post is longer than usual but such a bold prediction deserves it.
___
TLDR: 
My base case is that next week, Bitcoin will make another LL. I expect volatility and at least one shakeout. Ultimately, Bitcoin will reach a low between 47K ‚Äì 49K. 
After making the low, bitcoin will begin a relief rally, lasting until after the Fed meeting on September 17th. My analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs reaction to the previous rate cut in 2020 points to a temporary relief rally and a resumption of the downtrend. However, this rally can be savage and even go beyond the previous high of 65K. 
If I am correct, next week will be extremely difficult to trade. My best bet is to wait for 49K to get hit and buy with low leverage or wait for a trend reversal confirmation. 
I realize I strayed from the conventional interpretation of a corrective WXYZ. Some of you were kind enough to reach out and offer your opinion. I will include these as alternative scenarios. 

 Bitcoin Macro Outlook: 

I believe Bitcoin is in the final stages of a complex wave four correction. After This correction period, I expect a continuation in wave five to around 80K. 
 Where do I draw the line? 
Price: A weekly close below 43.6K, which is the 0.618 of wave 3.
Time: if this correction lasts after October 2024.  
Figure 1: Macro Outlook. 
  
Figure 2: Bitcoin Correction Price & Time Limits. 
  

 Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook: 

The selling pressure on Bitcoin is close to exhaustion. However, I still expect the price to make an LL next week. 
I outlined the path the price will take. ‚ÄúNo plan survives first contact with the enemy‚Äù (Helmuth von Moltke). The vital part of the plan is for the price to make a double-bottom scenario at around 49K. Invalidation is next.
Figure 3: Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook. 
  

 Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook Invalidation: 

Bitcoin holds the trendline and advances in a triangle breakout. 
This scenario is less likely for two reasons:
1. Because of the violation of the Gann Angle (2/1). 
2. The daily wick from August 5th has yet to be filled. 
Figure 4: Bitcoin Short-Term Invalidation. 
  
Figure 5: Gann Angles & Wick Fill. 
  

 Time Over Price:  

Gann believed that "Time is the most important factor of all." He argued that when sufficient time has elapsed, it could overbalance price, leading to a change in market trends. 
My premise is that we are due for a short relief rally after next week. Whatever happens after September 14th, I will look for long trades. 

Best Wishes

I just entered a bitcoin scalp long.

Understanding the Business Cycle and the Strategic Importance of Holding Bitcoin Through Economic Phases 

The four phases of the business cycle‚ÄîEarly Expansion, Maturing Expansion, Late Expansion, and Recession‚Äîeach play a crucial role in shaping economic activities, investment trends, and asset performances. For those engaged in crypto trading and investment, particularly within the Global Miranda Miner Research Group, it's essential to understand how Bitcoin fits into these phases and why holding onto Bitcoin, especially during the Recession phase, can be a strategic move.

Early Expansion: The Foundation of Growth
The Early Expansion phase is marked by the economy's recovery from a recession. During this phase, employment rates start to rise, business profits increase, and consumer confidence is restored. This period is characterized by heightened investments in sectors like Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Industrials, Information Technology, and Real Estate. Notably, Bitcoin, as a technology-driven asset, tends to attract investors looking for growth opportunities in innovative markets.

Coach Miranda Miner, a respected figure in cryptocurrency education, emphasizes the importance of recognizing Bitcoin's potential during this phase. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group highlights that as investor sentiment shifts towards growth and innovation, Bitcoin's role as a pioneering asset becomes more prominent. Those who invest in Bitcoin during the Early Expansion phase can potentially benefit from its growth trajectory as the economy continues to strengthen.

Maturing Expansion: The Peak of Economic Growth
As the economy moves into the Maturing Expansion phase, growth reaches its peak. Inflation pressures begin to emerge, and the economic environment becomes more complex. Investment strategies typically shift towards sectors such as Communication Services, Financials, Industrials, Information Technology (including Bitcoin), and Real Estate.

According to insights from the Global Miranda Miner Research Group, this phase is a critical juncture for Bitcoin investors. Coach Miranda Miner advises that while the market may experience volatility due to inflation concerns, Bitcoin's inherent properties‚Äîsuch as its limited supply and decentralized nature‚Äîposition it as a potential hedge against inflation. Investors within the crypto community are encouraged to maintain their Bitcoin holdings during this phase, as it can serve as a safeguard against traditional market fluctuations.

Late Expansion: Navigating Slowdowns and Strategic Positioning
The Late Expansion phase is characterized by a slowdown in economic growth. Interest rates may rise in response to inflationary pressures identified during the Maturing Expansion phase. During this period, investments often shift towards more defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Energy, Financials, Health Care, Materials, and Real Estate.

For Bitcoin investors, this phase requires a strategic approach. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group suggests that while traditional markets may start to feel the strain of rising interest rates, Bitcoin‚Äôs unique attributes could provide a buffer. Coach Miranda Miner points out that as economic conditions become more uncertain, holding Bitcoin can serve as a valuable counterbalance to more traditional assets, potentially offering protection against economic slowdowns.

Recession: The Opportunity to Accumulate and Hold
The Recession phase, where economic activity contracts, is often viewed with apprehension by investors. Jobs may be eliminated, and interest rates typically begin to decline as the economy attempts to stabilize. During this phase, investments generally focus on defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples, Energy, Health Care, and Utilities.

However, the Global Miranda Miner Research Group views the Recession phase as a prime opportunity for Bitcoin accumulation. Coach Miranda Miner strongly advocates for holding Bitcoin through this phase, emphasizing that historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience during economic downturns. The Recession phase often leads to a flight to safety, where investors seek assets that are less correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized and finite nature, stands out as a potential store of value in these uncertain times.

The Strategic Importance of Holding Bitcoin
Across all phases of the business cycle, the consistent theme promoted by Coach Miranda Miner and the Global Miranda Miner Research Group is the importance of holding Bitcoin. While the Early Expansion and Maturing Expansion phases may present opportunities for growth and profits, it is during the Late Expansion and Recession phases that the strategic value of Bitcoin becomes more apparent.

Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to act as a hedge against inflation, its independence from central bank policies, and its limited supply make it a unique asset in an investor's portfolio. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group advises that by maintaining a long-term perspective and holding Bitcoin through various economic cycles, investors can position themselves to benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs potential appreciation, particularly in post-recession recoveries.

Coach Miranda Miner often underscores the value of patience and conviction in cryptocurrency investment. The cyclical nature of the economy suggests that downturns are followed by recoveries. Investors who hold Bitcoin during challenging economic periods are often rewarded when the economy rebounds, and Bitcoin‚Äôs value appreciates in response to renewed investor confidence.

Conclusion: Navigating the Business Cycle with Bitcoin
Understanding the four phases of the business cycle is essential for any investor, particularly those involved in the cryptocurrency space. For members of the Global Miranda Miner Research Group and followers of Coach Miranda Miner, recognizing the strategic importance of holding Bitcoin through these phases is crucial. While each phase presents its own set of challenges and opportunities, the consistent advice is clear: Bitcoin, with its unique characteristics, should be held as a long-term asset.

By embracing this strategy, investors can potentially safeguard their portfolios against economic uncertainties and position themselves to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs growth as the economy moves through its cycles. In the words of Coach Miranda Miner, "In the world of crypto, patience is a virtue, and holding Bitcoin through the storm often leads to brighter days

üß†From a structural point of view, the double bottom bullish structure constructed near the buying zone has all the target zones achieved, so we need to be alert to the risk of a pullback.

‚û°Ô∏èFrom a wave theory perspective, if we start the Elliott Pulse Wave from here, then we can expect wave 5 to occur

‚û°Ô∏èSo, if you are involved in some long transactions, you can lock in the main profits and look forward to more. Unfortunately, yesterday's pullback did not touch our entry price, so we can only wait patiently for the next opportunity to come.

Bitcoin can reach up to 56,000 and maybe with a little optimism up to 57,800 in the second stage, for a stronger climb, you have to be a little patient so that the conditions are met.

Bitcoin price is moving in a descending channel on the 4-hour frame and is largely adhering to its borders.

The price has touched the lower limit of the channel, which is considered a support area in green at $53,000.

The price is now 54,600, which is the entry point.
The price is expected to reach the upper limit of the channel at $56,730.

These are the plots of pivot boss I created for almost 8 months, based on Renko chart and volumetric patterns, generally BTC will move along yellow-dash and blue-dash with red line as amplifier effect. Looking at this direction we have new hope by mid Sept on the 16th to hit 61K again, however the next drop will determined a new course of the ship. Hopefully I'm still as highly accurate on predicting BTC movement.
___
4H candle is closed very bullish!

The next important levels for BTC: 56,900 and 59,900
If we see bearish signs up there, we prepare for Sell/Short positions.

The BTC weekly chart is somewhat concerning. BTC is likely to correct on the daily timeframe back to the support zone and meet the weekly trendline. This area coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci level, and the RSI is also showing an oversold condition.

Elliot Wave Theory is an absolute favorite of mine, combined with Wyckoff Method and chart analysis (trendlines and technical indicators). If you've been following; you'll know I've been speaking of a multi-month cycle, specifically a multi month corrective wave before the final impulse wave up (4-5).

Considering we're still in that corrective phase, let's take a look at TWO options from here:

 Option 1 , is we retrace around -50%, same as last time. However, this would pose an issue - if we drop lower than (1), it invalidates the Elliot Wave Theory, and also invalidates the bullish cycle. The second problem, is that the previous cycle's increase (2-3) was MUCH bigger than the current 2-3 we are observing. This brings us to option 2.


 Option 2 , is that we retrace around the same ratio as the previous cycle. To calculate the ration, we need to see what % we retraced and compare it to the % increase. 
We increased 1533.92% (2-3)and retraced 55.25% (3-4). That means it's a 3.6% correction compared to the increase.
For the current cycle, we increased 357.27% (2-3) and retraced 33.76% (3-4). This gives us a 9,45% correction - three times as much as the previous cycle.


You can take this two ways -  either we're following a 50% correction, OR we're not falling lower than the current point 4 which is around $49K.

The important support level at $53,600 should be kept for now.

 If the price reclaims $55,500 and consolidates, this will open the gates for $60,000

 If Bitcoin loses the $53,600 support and the price consolidates here,. $52,000 - $50,000 is just a matter of time.

 At worst, Bitcoin will retest $48,000 - $46,000

Undoubtedly, last week was a slow week as far as tradeable setups go. üìâ We haven't had many obvious plays.

Here are setups for the week:
üìùContinuation plays on the bear side
    Reaction off the low for a counter trend model 2 
    Reaction of the last lower high for a continuation play 

For each one of these plays I will be waiting for a change in market structure before entry.

Hello trader's 
Here is the new update about your target 
if you missed it then don't regeret it again give chances..

Hey everyone!

Appreciate a like and follow if this analysis helps!

Welcome to this BTC update. BTC is trading inside a broadening wedge pattern in the daily time frame and currently hovering near the lower trendline of the wedge. 

Every time the price tested the lower trendline, it formed a new lower low but, the first time, it made a Lower high, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. This could signal the end of the downtrend and the beginning of a new uptrend.

A potential bullish outcome includes a new all-time high by the end of the year.

Invalidation: Daily close below the previous lower low.

üìä#BTC reaches the periodic resistance zone

üß†From a structural point of view, we have constructed a bullish double bottom structure near the buying zone, which means that the previous decline is over, so we need to be wary of a continued rebound.

‚û°Ô∏èAt present, we are near the resistance zone and the downward trend line, and there is an expectation of resistance and a fall, so even if we are bullish, we need to wait for a period of correction before participating. The next strong resistance is near 57.3k.

Last weeks high: $59,829.20 
Last weeks low: $52,551.34 
Midpoint: $56,190.27

More sell-off last week in the crypto markets, very tough market conditions continue, hitting the $52,000 bullish OB+ again, the first time being exactly one month before.
This area had held as support previously but it needs to hold this time around too, failing that $50,000 is the bottom of the daily downtrend channel. 

US CPI (Wednesday) & PPI (Thursday) this week, as with big news events we can potentially see volatility, this will be the last US CPI before rate cuts begin in the US, in Europe rate cuts are forecast to begin on Thursday, predicted to drop from 4.25% to 3.65% according to invesing.com, a 60bps cut.

Another major news event this week is the Trump v Harris Presidential debate. I'm not expecting a whole lot of crypto talk in this debate, if I'm being completely honest I can't see it being an adult debate about political policy at all. However, I do think it will have an effect on the markets one way or another, obviously Trump is the better outcome for crypto if he stays true to his plans set out during the Bitcoin conference compared to the plans for the Harris administration to tax un-realized gains which is not very pro-investment. Again, I'm not holding my breath for any information on crypto but it is a major news event all the same.

So in conclusion this week is full of news events that could create volatility, with BTC at its current level nearer the bottom of the daily trend. It does feel like we're maybe coming to an end of the chop with monetary policy pivot taking place soon.

Market Analysis: 

The current market structure for Bitcoin (BTC) is exhibiting bearish tendencies. The price is approaching a significant high level, and there are potential selling pressures near the Order Block and Point of Interest (POI). Additionally, the Fibonacci Golden Zone is a critical area to watch.

 Trade Recommendation: 

If the price breaks below 55,100, it could indicate a surge in selling pressure. To capitalize on this potential downtrend, consider a short position.

 Trade Details: 

 Entry:  Sell BTCUSDT below 55,080
 Target:  54,400 - 54,000 - 53,800
 Stop Loss:  300-500 points

 Rationale: 

 Bearish Structure:  The overall market structure suggests a bearish trend.
 Order Block and POI:  These areas often act as resistance levels, and a break below them could trigger a sell-off.
 Fibonacci Golden Zone:  This zone represents a significant price level that could offer resistance.
 Liquidity:  The presence of large liquidity levels at 54,400 - 54,188 could provide support for a potential price decline.
 
Note:  This is a general recommendation based on the current market analysis. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any trading decisions.

BTCUSDT continues its downward trend, with a noticeable lack of buying pressure since late August. The price action has been characterized by consistent lower lows and lower closes. Even on the daily chart, we see this pattern persisting, despite a recent false breakout below the July low, with the price hovering near that level again. Historically, September tends to be a difficult month for Bitcoin, often resulting in negative performance. This pattern suggests that the price could drop further, potentially breaking below the 50,000 mark and aiming for the support zone between 48,000 and 45,000. If the price reaches this zone, a strong rebound could occur, potentially sparking a new bullish trend. The target is the support level at 51,220.00
___
it is very clear to me that this year bear cycle is not going to be like covid crash since the FED has announced IT IS TIME TO ADJUST POLICY from being restrictive to easing. fill your bags with the good ones and for sure BTC is one of them.
___
Market filled its inefficiency resting at 55.3k as weekly closes.

Late shorters are getting stopped out. 

If traders keep on shorting, a squeeze toward 56k area is very likely.

Reaction at 56k level will be really telling and where the FOMO buyers would be piling in.

 Area of Interest: 
Wait for a valid retest on ltf demand 53.7k to 53.3k targeting single prints/poor highs or if price can get toward resting liquidity above marginally lower highs.

 Possible Targets: 
56.7k
58.3k
60.2k

Unfortunately, despite having a bullish divergence in 4H timeframe and reaching the support zone of 54,600 - 56,100, #BTC didn't show the small pump that was expected! there's probably an underlying reason for this that we don't know yet but  maybe something is going to take place in the coming days!

Anyways, since the bullish divergence didn't work and BTC crossed below the lower trendline and the mentioned support zone in one big candle, it can be said that the sell pressure is indeed strong. The main scenario is that any upward move towards the mentioned area which is now a resistance is considered a retest and Sell/Short strategy should be applied. Secondary scenario is crossing above the resistance zone which isn't very likely at the moment.

As it's been stated over and over for the past few weeks, the overall trend/sentiment is indeed bearish and BTC is most probably heading for 45,000 and then 42,000 zones!
___
My expectations from the previous post have materialized, and the price of Bitcoin has dropped again into the price imbalance zone below 53,500. My expectations for Bitcoin's price next week are as follows: due to negative economic news, the stock market will likely continue to decline for several more days starting on Monday. Since Bitcoin's price correlates with key indices like the S&P and Dow Jones, there is a high probability that Bitcoin will continue to decline, potentially reaching as low as 48,900.

If we look at the Long-Term Holder Realized Profit/Loss Ratio 7D indicator, which unfortunately is not yet available publicly on the TradingView platform, based on this data, Bitcoin is currently in an accumulation phase before a major growth season. Similar patterns occurred during the 2011 and 2021 market seasons.
___
I'm spotting a Inverted head and shoulders pattern on 15m. Hopefully we should get a measured move to $54,900 and then possibly short from $55,500. We will see.
___
Money flowing out of Bitcoin will flow to the Altcoins?

How are you feeling today my dear reader?
I am hoping you are having a wonderful week.

Just as a friendly reminder, Bitcoin's correction is not yet over and $40,000 is likely NOT the bottom of this corrective phase.

How low it truly goes it is an open ended question but it is something that will surprise most participants, as usual.

Why would Bitcoin move lower?
Why not 100K?

The market moves in cycles and it tends to seek balance.

A prolonged bullish wave, 16 months, is matched by a strong correction.
It is just the way it works.

This is normal market action and this should not discourage anybody... We are full green for 2025 and the only troublesome period is between now and October.

The "trouble" period for Bitcoin is August 2024 and September 2024.
October 2024, November 2024 and December 2024 is neutral and recovery.

January 2025 and February 2025, is back to high prices and green.  Then we will see massive growth in 2025 until we hit a new All-Time High of around $190,000.  More or less.

Hold strong throughout the correction.

Consider the altcoins. Many hit bottom. It is wise to buy those trading low and sell those trading high. Trading 101. Simplicity is key.

Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions.

Namaste.

Real traders know that we never say never. These are real levels with many touch points of data that we want to use when looking left. Its possible we come down to 30 k or lower. I know im going to get heckled by the moonboys. "oh bro jus hodl. 1 billion dollar btc programmed bro" uh no little timmy. Btc and crypto need to stitch together real levels of support and put in a base before any real movement higher. 
Just remember dont get cocky kid. It can crash harder and can soar higher thn any other asset . its completely tied to liquidity and rn. Things look bad in the markets on a global scale. A time will come when we go to new highs, but rn its not. I do prefer the gold chart as it paints the real picture. Bitcoin has set in a lower high against gold. I would pay attention to that chart as well.

So, here we are. Hope these updates helped a little in navigating what has not been an easy market at all. Predicting these moves is near impossible, but we can look at possible zones and levels where we might interact with price and prepare for multiple scenarios.

We have cleaned up a lot of bad lows we had, only to sweep a previous low by $10. Technically that's a sweep, in reality it's not a very convincing one.

Open Interest declined a little bit, but not by any meaningful amount: there are still 30-40k contracts that opened during the $55-60k range, that's a bit troublesome still.

Previous plans:

It's a bit unclear, so we'll have to monitor as we go. Going by the squiggles, we lost GP and are now in the red path. On the other hand, we can see it as yellow that just went a little deeper.

It will depend a bit how much time we spend down here, but I'd disregard anything that happens over the weekend since price is just naturally drifting up to fill the imbalance we left.

Ideal scenario is the blue path I've added: sweep the recent low on Monday or Tuesday, but quick reclaim, then take out the bad highs around 60k. Then we take it from there.

Majority of retail traders are bullish for Q4, stating that the US Election will be bullish as Trump will be elected. 
Many are forgetting that leverage in the crypto market remains high according to Glassnode On-chain analytic data. 
Hedge funds and leveraged funds still remain majority short, whereas retail traders have added to long positions according to the latest CME COT report. 
As retail traders remain overwhelmingly bullish, trying to long every single falling knife, real capitulation has yet to happen. 
Although we may get a small bounce in the short term, I think this will be minimal. We will likely see 48k in September and then 41k later in October/November. 
Expecting Q1 2025 to be bullish and ATH may be exceeded in mid-2025 which goes against current consensus.

Bitcoin has nearly completed its last flush before resuming its upwards trend. it's nearly retraced to the 0.382 level and in the process created a falling wedge pattern.

Right now the price needs to either get back inside the wedge it spilled out from, or create a lower low so we can rise to 66,000 to 70,000 range for the first half of September, and from there tumble down to create a lower low from $49,000 which should ideally complete this long, complex corrective pattern W-X-Y-X-Z for wave 4.
___
hello guys.

as I published before.



 Descending Channel:  The price is trading within a downward channel, indicating a short-term bearish trend.

 Upside Rejection:  Attempts to break above the upper boundary near $59,000 failed, suggesting resistance.

 Downside Target:  If the price continues to follow the channel, it may target the lower boundary near $54,000.

 Key Levels: 
 
 Resistance: $59,000
 Support: $54,000
 Outlook: Bearish momentum with potential downside extension towards the lower support zone. Watch for any break below $54,000 or above the channel for trend reversal signals.

Hi traders,

Last week Bitcoin went a little more up and then dropped just like I've said in my outlook.

Now we could see some upside again. So for next week we could see this pair go to the Daily BPR.

Let's see what the market does and react.

Trade idea: Wait for a change in orderflow to bullish, a small correction down on a lower timeframe and trade longs.

Bitcoin is moving in a descending channel on the 4-hour frame and the price has reached a strong support area in green at $57,200

There are rising loads from the current support level but it needs upward momentum to be able to reach the targets

Entry price $58,000

First target $60,257

Second target $62,236

Third target $64,000

The pattern is canceled if the support level in green at $57,200 is broken

Bitcoin Update:

BTC closed below  GETTEX:54K  on the daily chart, bringing the price close to the support trendline. As expected, BTC has made a bearish move.

What‚Äôs next?

The $50.6K support, or around $50K, must hold to help BTC rebound and rally. The RSI is attempting to form a bullish divergence; if successful, it could be positive for BTC.

For now, all eyes are on the support range between $50K and $52.5K.

Hope this helps. Trade safely.

The Inverted Head and Shoulders pattern is a reversal pattern that typically signals a change in trend from a bullish (uptrend) to a bearish (downtrend). In this pattern, the right shoulder is larger than the head, which can be due to changes in supply and demand dynamics, such as a sudden increase in selling pressure( Mt. Gox distribution and  sales by the German government.)
___
wxy-abc-wxy corrective waves are a lesser known waveform that should be familiar to the og Elliot wave traders from the 2000s. The current chart of BTC is following the same Elliot counts as the charts of SPX and NDX from 2009-2011. 
Often times, hedge fund trading algorithms 'map out' price patterns following these waveforms and if this is correct, the wxy pattern should end soon, and the final y leg has likely started or is about to start. 
If this is true, the bottom should be below 49k, and as per my OB analysis, this lies between 41k to 43k.

#Bitcoin Update | Saturday, 07.09.2024

Good Morning to All Brothers and Sisters,

#Bitcoin dropped as predicted in my last analysis, touching nearly all support levels. It found support at the bottom of our yellow area, and the working week closed there. Now, the key point is where the Sunday weekly candle will close. In my opinion, it's time for a trend reversal.

What's Next?

In my view, the price will likely remain within the FRD line until tomorrow. After that, we may see a retracement. If the price crosses the second resistance (blue and black lines), this will confirm the trend reversal. Otherwise, if the price breaks below the yellow area, it could drop further.

#ALTS

There has been significant bleeding in altcoins, but after Bitcoin breaks through the first resistance, I will start providing new signals on #ALTS. Make sure to activate your notifications and stay tuned.

Wishing you all a great weekend!

BTCUSDT / 1D TIME FRAME

 HELLO TRADERS 

Tendency , prices is under upward pressure until prices trading above 52.047 .

The current upward pressure on prices is supported by the fact that they are trading above the key level of 52,047. Staying above this level signals continued bullish momentum, with projections suggesting potential gains toward 57,112 and eventually reaching 64,853, a key supply zone where sellers may step in. For the uptrend to be confirmed, prices need to break through this supply zone. 

However, if prices drop below the turning level of 52,047 and a daily or 4-hour candle closes beneath it, this would indicate a potential reversal. In such a case, prices could fall to 46,981, with further downside potential to 44,019. A confirmed downtrend would require prices to stabilize below the 46,981 support level, signaling stronger bearish sentiment.

 KEY LEVELS : 
 
 Turning Level : 52,047.
 Resistance Levels : 57,112 , 64,853.
 Support Levels : 46,981 , 44,019.

What I expected during the week and especially mentioned in yesterday's idea, happened today.
What was I looking for?
I was looking for a short sharp and fast position.
I only trade Sol, but I put the price action of Bitcoin as a reference.
For example:
Sol and Bitcoin prices were in the discount area before the New York session.
According to ICT concepts, the starting point of a good and sharp short (trigger point to enter the trade) is when the price is in the premium area.
In the New York session (between 10 and 11), the price of Bitcoin had touched 50% Fibo, but the price of Sol was a little far from reaching its 50% Fibo.
Therefore, when the price of Bitcoin reached 50% Fibo and its price started to go down,
In the Sol price chart, I looked for short setup and entry into the trade.
And as I expected, the price reached the target (122).
The duration of this trade was about 8 hours.
Wish you enjoy your trades in this week!
Happy Weekend!
___
That move was necessary and clears the way to move back up to 58k. It may even do it over the weekend. It's been holding price for a while and I feel like they may actually carry it out. The crypto market often does the unexpected. See you Monday!

The chart shows that BTC/USDT is trading within a descending wedge pattern, with price action consistently testing the lower boundary of this pattern.
The price is currently sitting at a crucial support level of around $52,408, represented by the green trendline and the horizontal yellow line, which has served as a historical support area.
Support and Resistance Levels:

 Immediate support is around $52,408. A break below this level could lead to a retest of lower support near the $50,000 psychological level or potentially lower.

The nearest resistance is the upper boundary of the descending wedge, followed by horizontal resistance around $66,000.
Possible Scenario:

 A strong bounce off the current support level around $52,408, followed by a breakout above the upper boundary of the descending wedge, could signal a bullish reversal. A breakout above $66,000 would confirm a strong uptrend continuation.

 If BTC fails to hold the support at $52,408, we could see increasing selling pressure, pushing the price down towards the next support level.

A head and shoulders pattern formation was completed earlier, indicating a bearish signal that appeared in the downward movement.

Currently, the descending wedge pattern is typically a bullish reversal pattern; thus, a breakout to the upside would align with the usual outcome of this pattern.

Monitoring volume is essential; a breakout with a strong volume would validate the move.

Oscillators such as the RSI and MACD would provide further confirmation; look for an oversold signal on the RSI or a bullish crossover on the MACD.

Manage risk with stop-loss levels below current support if bullish, or slightly above the upper boundary of the wedge if a continued bearish move is expected.
This analysis suggests that BTC is at a pivotal point, with significant upside potential depending on the integrity of the support level. Keep an eye on volume and price action near key levels for cues to the next major direction.

Hi there,

BTCUSDT appears bearish on the H1 chart, indicating a bias of 54001.88 below 55825.34. The nearest support line is at 54862.55.

If the price breaks above 57666.36, the setup will be considered invalid.

Happy Trading,

 Hello Traders, 
 
 Despite positive economic sentiment, BTC still fluctuating inside the box.
 If the price stays above the yellow area, the green scenario is valid and after that if price breaks above the 65K level and stabilize there, 66690 and 70100 levels are the next price resistances.
 According to the recent market heatmap, some shadows may occur inside the circle area for some market liquidation.
 

 Stay tuned for more updates.

We've been in this flag for a while. I am looking to capitalize on a retrace to past previous support zones on the weekly timeframes, 50-52k.

The last weekly candle had a strong engulfing close.   
The current weekly candle started pushing upwards which brings me to the overall play, a short once the weekly candle flips on itself and breaks the current low.

The current H4 chart is starting to align with the overall vision, same engulfing candle driving price down to the entry point zone. I usually expect the same "movement conditions" as the last time we were in a determined zone and from 57,000 to 54500 we should have a somewhat similar clean move down. My goal is to clear my risk once we go down to 54500. 

  

I am expecting the US rate cuts to drive the price further down to retest the 50-52 thousand range. The overall idea in the rate cuts is rather simple. A rate cut implies that more investment opportunities will then be "profitable" when compared to other investment vehicles, therefore a lot of people/banks that are holding to BTC for hedging purposes, will now be tempted to resume with other investments and thus driving down the price of BTCUSD.

Other major economies are expected to lower their marginal lending rates as well, so this can easily play out for a while. 

Interest Rate Cut dates:
 
 EUR / 12 Sept 2024
 CAD / 4 Sept 2024
 USD / 18 Sept 2024
 

If the first target is hit, then partials are to be taken out and a residual position will be left as a runner with a trailing stop.

According to the chart, it seems that Bitcoin has completed a flat correction pattern. Two high-probability support areas consisting of overlapping different Fibonacci percentages are marked with green areas on the chart. This flat pattern will likely end in one of these areas. Given that the price has entered the first support zone, any price increase above the end of wave iv confirms the start of the third bullish wave of Bitcoin. I expect the start of a powerful uptrend in the coming days and even hours.

Hello traders, today after the US data released, crypto market collapse started, and reached around 53k, and my analysis for crypto is to touch 48k then moving towards 80k or above... after breaking the high of 74k ...


enjoy trading!
___
If you notice from the arrows, all BTC has done is reach lower high after lower high. So my expectation is that it will descend lower to the liquidity shown in the 48k. I see no reason why it would suddenly rise higher and not grab that sell side liquidity first! 

This is simply an opinion, not financial advice of any kind!

If price can hold the green support/ 0.618 Fib retracement / 1.618 Fib extension

there is a chance for an next impulse in either 

wave C (wave 4 not complete)
or an wave 3 (wave 4 complete)

if the next impulse reaches the 1.236 fib extension the highs will be in reach 
a large candle or short squeeze above the highs will indicate it will be an wave 3 intermediate and wave 5 primary has already started

for the long term count wave 5 could be extended like in the 2017 bullrun
look for my older post for the extended wave 5 possibility for more details

We have entered a long position on BTC/USDT on the 4-hour timeframe after the trade was triggered at a key support level. The strategy is to leverage this 4-hour support zone with the goal of targeting the previous high. We will be actively monitoring this trade and making adjustments as the price action unfolds.

Key Levels:

	‚Ä¢	Entry: Initiated at the current support level on the 4-hour chart, where buyers have historically stepped in.
	‚Ä¢	Target: Aiming for a move towards the previous high, where the price may encounter resistance.
	‚Ä¢	Stop-Loss: Placed below the support level to protect against further downside risk, ensuring a favorable risk-to-reward ratio.

Rationale:
This trade is based on the assumption that the 4-hour support will hold, providing a springboard for a move back towards the previous high. The technical setup aligns with a potential bullish reversal, but we remain cautious given the market‚Äôs volatility.

Risk Management:
We will be actively monitoring this position, ready to adjust stop-loss levels and take partial profits as the trade progresses. The focus is on managing risk effectively while capitalizing on the potential upside.

 Note: Please remember to adjust this trade idea according to your individual trading conditions, including position size, broker-specific price variations, and any relevant external factors. Every trader‚Äôs situation is unique, so it‚Äôs crucial to tailor your approach to your own risk tolerance and market environment.

üß†Although there was a strong rise today due to the stimulation of the news, a long structure was not established on the hourly chart, so I cautiously maintained a wait-and-see attitude.

We are going back to basics. These are the lessons I used to share in 2018.

The black line stands for MA200.
The magenta line stands for EMA55.

MA200 is a slow moving moving average. 
EMA55 is a fast moving moving average, in comparison to MA200.

‚ûñ The bullish cross

When EMA55 moves above MA200 we have a bullish cross. This is a bullish signal.
Here it happened in January 2023 and October 2023, in both cases this signal preceded a major rise in prices.

‚ûñ The bearish cross

When EMA55 moves below MA200 we have a bearish cross. This is a bearish signal.
Here it happened recently, mid-August 2024. This signal points to a major decrease in prices.

These basic signals support all the more complex analyses I've been sharing.

There are many of these. I can find literally hundreds.

‚û¢ If you have experience or have been with me for many years you will find this boring.

‚û¢ If you are new, you might find this useful.

‚û¢ If you've been burdened by too much information, too many opinions and complexity, you might find this enlightening and soothing for your mind.

In any case, please support this trade-idea with your comments and boost.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen, more than 30,000 Bitcoins have been transferred to Binance earlier today...

In a previous article, we mentioned the best case scenario and the idea of ignoring the worst case scenario, this can be a mistake. The truth is that Bitcoin, the Cryptocurrency market, tends to surprise, always, either on the bullish or bearish side. Regardless of what happens, it is always wise to consider all scenarios.

The altcoins are correcting below our baseline, which we defined as the price level at which these projects traded around January 2024. The truth is that most altcoins are going back to October 2023 price levels. This is the same price at which the market traded before the major 2023/24 bullish wave; after the long consolidation phase.

Some altcoins did even worse and went lower to break below their June 2023 low and others broke down even further, including big and highly recognized projects, and crashed below their May/June 2022 low reaching new All-Time Lows. Bitcoin is currently trading at the same price it traded back in April/March 2024; very high by all standards.

The higher it trades, and the longer it takes to drop, the stronger the strength of the bearish move. This is called bearish consolidation, which in turn is a distribution phase. The distribution phase is termed so because the big players and large Bitcoin holders distribute their coins to the rest of the market.

Just as a long six months bullish consolidation (accumulation) phase led to a massive bullish rise. In reverse, a long six months bearish consolidation (distribution) phase can lead to a massive bearish crash.

Bitcoin grew just like certain altcoins, it did better than most. Only a few projects grew more than Bitcoin in terms of previous past action. Meaning, only a few projects moved to hit new All-Time Highs. It was Bitcoin and these few. The rest produced a strong wave in late 2023, others minimum growth.

While we know and assume that Bitcoin isn't likely to crash as the altcoins, because of its size and fame, look what happened to Ethereum... And Ethereum is gearing up for another round of the same. The same dynamic where Junk-base is buying billions of Ether to sell to Spot ETF holders at a low price continue. They are accumulating to sell en-mass.

Hope for the best; prepare for the worst.

The best scenario puts Bitcoin at $40,000 as the correction bottom. This can easily still be true.

A stronger correction would send Bitcoin lower toward the $33,000 - $36,000 price range.

A doom scenario and things getting really bad, for whatever reason because things tend to develop always as a surprise, would be Bitcoin between $33,000 and $26,000 on a wick. $26,000 is the price at which Bitcoin traded in October 2023, which is before the final impulse that led to our newest and latest All-Time High of $73,777.

Regardless of the general perception, such a move wouldn't change much in how Bitcoin continues to grow and evolve in the long-term. This can happen if some unforeseen event hits the market. Also because we have about 3 weeks of continued bearish action, which is plenty of time for everything to show up. The least expected scenario is always the one that comes to pass.

There is always good news... The stronger the correction, the stronger the recovery that will follow.

The stronger the panic, the stronger is the lesson that the market participants will learn.

The bigger the shock, the stronger the market reaction and after the recovery happens, more confidence in the system develops and everybody will know for certain, forever that Bitcoin is here to stay.

I am not saying that we will necessarily see $26K but, prepare for the worst... Just in case.

Namaste.

This trade is based on Power Variation for measuring volatility, Gaussian Kernel Smoothing EMA, and Value at Risk, nothing else.

Bitcoin‚Äôs current market dynamics indicate more upside potential. The recent bullish momentum suggests that we haven't reached the point where a significant trend reversal is likely.
___
Let‚Äôs dive into where Bitcoin‚Äôs been over the past week and what might be coming next. I‚Äôm going to show you two charts we‚Äôve been tracking. 
  
üìâChart 1: Tracking the Trend Since March
Since March, Bitcoin has been in a steady downtrend, marked by lower highs and lower lows. However, about a week ago, we flagged a potential bottom after hitting a significant low on August 5th. The key question was whether we‚Äôd see a higher low after that, signaling the start of a trend reversal. On September 6th, we did, in fact, get that higher low, which is the first sign of a potential shift in direction. 

But for a true reversal, we need confirmation in the form of a higher high. As of now, we‚Äôre still waiting for that higher high, which I‚Äôve highlighted on the chart (around $65,000). The Stochastic RSI is approaching overbought levels, so we may see a correction soon. Ideally, this would happen after hitting that higher high to confirm the reversal.
  
üìàChart 2: Sideways Action Throughout the Summer
The second chart shows the sideways action we‚Äôve been experiencing, which has been the foundation of my summer trading strategy. I mentioned I‚Äôd stay bullish as long as Bitcoin remained above the orange box, and so far, it‚Äôs held up. 

If we do get that higher high and then a correction, I‚Äôll be looking to go long on a dip back toward the red box. It‚Äôs all about sticking to the plan. Once again, the Stochastic RSI is overbought, so a correction is likely. However, I‚Äôm watching for enough upward momentum to give us that higher high before any pullback.

üí°Final Thoughts
As always, Bitcoin‚Äôs movements tend to guide the rest of the market, so keeping a close eye on BTC‚Äôs price action is crucial for understanding the bigger picture. Stay prepared for both bullish and bearish outcomes, and have a plan ready for whichever direction we head next. 

Stay safe and trade smart!

üíé#Bitcoin Analysis
‚è±Based on the daily timeframe:

üìå#Bitcoin is currently within an bullish channel on the 4-hour timeframe (see the green channel in the figure).

‚úÖüöÄAs long as it remains within this channel, the strong bull-trend will continue.
This means that any dips will be limited to the mid-line and bottom of this channel.

üéØAnd the growth towards the next targets:
üöÄTarget 1: 66755.85
üöÄüöÄTarget 2: The diagonal line drawn from the two previous highs (see the figure)
üöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 3: 74537.70

üîªü§èHowever, if the aforementioned bullish channel is broken, we will enter a temporary bearish phase (the bull-trend is maintained) and return to the support zone of 57877.90-58116.32 (although this zone is better covered by two red diagonal lines in the figure)

üìàüìâThis zone will cause #Bitcoin to form a bottom and start growing based on the return triangle pattern (the potential growth structures of #Bitcoin are schematically shown on the left side of the chart).

‚ùåStop-loss for the growth scenario and entering a deep bearish phase: If the red zone is broken downwards in D timeframe, the trend will change from bullish to bearish, and we will witness a deep decline in #Bitcoin.
..............................
üíé1-Hour Timeframe Bitcoin Analysis 

üöÄBased on the above (main) analysis, as long as we are within the 4-hour timeframe bullish channel, there is a chance of very short-term dips and subsequent resumption of growth

üåüWithin this channel, there are 3 important support levels for price reversal:

‚úÖ First support: #Bitcoin's daily support at the price of 62781.58 (15-minute timeframe pivot), if there is a positive reaction from this support, the market can grow in the form of a head and shoulders or rectangle pattern (the condition for growth in this case is the breakdown of the resistance of each of these two structures. The schematic of the structure is in the figure)

‚úÖ Second support: Mid-line of the bullish channel

‚úÖ Third support: Bottom of the bullish channel

‚ÄºÔ∏èThe second and third supports have a good alignment with lower timeframe supports, which are not drawn in the figure

is this the range until after the halving event?

We have a monthly OB defending the low
We have a monthly OB defending the mid (currently. broken up from)
and we have dual monthly OBs at the high

at the moment there is a high probability the halving event is a sell the news but will bitcoin ever see lower than 35k again?

the arrow is not necessarily the direction im aiming however i do expect a break up from this range in the future rather than a breakdown.

35k line in the sand
hold 45k and the consolidation could be even tighter
upwards expansion from 60k is inevitable

BTC recently broke above a key resistance trendline after forming a higher low near the 52,000-53,000 USD range. It is currently trading at around 63,445 USD.

The brown-shaded area on the chart highlights a zone between approximately 62,000 and 70,000 USD, which appears to be a significant resistance zone.
The green trendline below seems to represent a long-term support level, from which BTC has rebounded multiple times.

 The yellow and purple moving averages on the chart suggest a short-term bullish momentum, with the shorter-term average trending upward and the price breaking above it.
Downward Resistance Line: A previously descending resistance line was broken, indicating a potential bullish breakout.
BTC appears to be entering a bullish continuation phase, attempting to push further into the resistance zone. If the price holds above the 62,000 USD level, it could target the upper end of the brown zone near 70,000 USD.

Let me know if you'd like a more detailed technical analysis!

1. The March-May 2024 scenario might be repeating.
2. Most likely,  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  will test the 65,175$ zone; if not, we are confidently heading back to the 53-48k range.
3. If the 65k zone is tested, the next target is 68k. And here it‚Äôs crucial to observe whether everything follows the March-May 2024 scenario again with a downward reversal, or if this zone will be passed. If the 68k zone is broken, we are in for a new  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  ATH.
4. Despite strong demand for  CRYPTOCAP:BTC , the altcoin market is very weak right now.  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  is confidently dominating.

Yesterday,  Bitcoin  continued its upward movement and reached our sales zone of $63,000-$64,300 (accumulated volume zone), from which we received a reaction.

At the moment, a correction can be expected, but within the framework of the upward trend. The decline may stop at the local low of $62,600, the new local volume zone of $62,400-$62,000, or the more global volume anomaly zone mentioned yesterday of $61,000-$60,300.
We are still moving within our long scenario and the next target for the movement will be $66,000.

 Purchase zones:  $62,400-$62,000 (local volume zone), $61,000-$60,300 (volume anomalies), $57,000-$56,400 (volume zone).

 Sales zone  and the next target for the movement: $66,100-$68,200 (volume zone).

 Interesting altcoins. 

For the  REEF  coin, we noticed large fixations that could trigger a correction.
When testing the zone of $0,00467-$0,00486 and if there is a reaction from it, we open a short with the goal of updating the local low of $0,004.

There are a lot of diverse opinions about Bitcoin, right? The only issue is, I don't know how they are completely certain that they are right! Perhaps I am overly doubtful.


----- There was a  bullish flag   formation on the Bitcoin  *weekly*  chart. To finish the flag pattern, Bitcoin needs to end September with a monthly close between $68,000 and $70,000. This is the optimal outcome. If it falls within the range of $65,000 to $68,000, it is likely to proceed but caution is advised.


----- However on the same time , a  bearish triangle  was formed on the  *monthly* chart of Bitcoin. so if monthly close below $62,000 is considered bearish.


-----if it ends from $62,000 to $65,000, the irritating consolidation will persist.


For the benefit of altcoins, Bitcoin needs to hit $68,000. For what reason? Due to the fact that many of them have passed away and been interred! The crypto market needs $68,000 to continue operating. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I believe  BTC will hit (only hit, not closing!) $68,000-$70,000 within the upcoming days. Following that, I would patiently await the market's decision. Do not touch BTC and focus on altcoins with both eyes. TAO, FTM, SUI, CKB, and RSR appear to be in a positive trend. Some individuals like TIA,CFX,NEO,NEAR,IMX and etc have the ability to increase their daily movement by 30% to 50%. However, cash out your earnings and be patient for Bitcoin.

- Macro Overview

Investors have withdrawn approximately 7,500 BTC, primarily led by larger investors, pushing bitcoin exchange balances to the lowest point in 2.5 months. After a significant reduction by ARKB, their investors led an $81.1 million investment out of the total $158.3 million invested yesterday, followed by FBTC. A more positive sentiment as Q4 approaches may support bitcoin prices.

- Technical Analysis

BTCUSD is approaching the upper boundary of the ascending channel near 64,000. The price remains above both EMAs, indicating the potential for a mean reversion. If BTCUSD extends its rally beyond 63,900, the next resistance level could be tested at 65,000. Meanwhile, BTCUSD may pull back to the 61,600-62,200 zone if a correction occurs before a stronger upward move.
___
BTCUSDT chart shows a strong bullish trend after breaking the important resistance. In addition, the price is currently trading above the 34 and 89 EMA, confirming the medium to long-term outlook of the coin.

However, the current bullish momentum could be vulnerable as a close look shows that the price has not been able to break above the $63,000 resistance and is trading steadily around $62,100.

I would now need to act more clearly before confirming a correction to consolidate before buying on a bullish basis.

Trading Strategy: Consider opening a long position when the price approaches or slightly corrects to the EMA, with a carefully placed stop-loss to avoid risks due to unexpected volatility.

MEXC:BTCUSDT  

  Apparently a correction has been started.
The high of the structure confirmed by touching the IDM.i.
If the 1H candle closed lower than IDM.i,
we may expect price to drop further to the DP.i / ENG.i / EX.i
otherwise the IDM.i grabbed and make a SCOB for us to enter another Buy Position and the target one is the high of structure (63850) and the second target is the MPL zone (64460).

P.S: In the DPs & ENGs zones and grabbed IDMs we MUST get a confirmation signal to enter position which is SCOB or lower time frame (LTF) ChoCh. (EXs are confirmation-free entries)

I will update Bitcoin regularly..
Take Care

The first level is to take 40% profit, 30% profit at the second level, and for the last 30%, I‚Äôll wait for the reaction of liquidity entering the market. I can expect BTC to reach around $120,000. This is just my opinion and not financial advice.

Yesterday, we moved within our scenario for  Bitcoin ‚Äîbetween two volume zones. After the news from the US Federal Reserve about the reduction of the key interest rate, Bitcoin managed to break through the current range and moved higher.

At the moment, we have small position fixations from the buyer, which may provoke a small correction into the new volume zone of $61,000-$60,300, from which we will expect the resumption of the upward movement at least to the next sales zone.

We slightly revised the buying zones on the global timeframe.

 Buying zones:  $61,000-$60,300 (volume anomalies), $57,000-$56,400 (volume zone), $55,000-$53,800 (largest horizontal volume for the last month + accumulated volume), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies).

 Selling zones:  $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes), $66,100-$68,200 (volume 
zone).

 Interesting altcoins.

I'm not into selling short when i see a possible dip incoming. So I decided to set a limit order to buy bitcoin at 58850 today. The idea is to expect a lot of buy orders around 0.38 fibonacci retracement level. There are accumulated limit buy orders around 58850 if you check Coinglass.

No idea when to exit this trade. I personally will probably wait for the US election day for reference. 

Happy trading!
___
Yesterday's FED decision on rate interests, is a fundamental change of character, since we have moved from restricting liquidity to the start the economical stimuli. Technically this policy change should turn into a bullish scenario. 

Nevertheless, the political landscape still is not clear. Until US's elections turmoil is over, we  will have more certainty. In the long run, a democratic or republican president should have the same effect. However, in the middle and short terms, the effect would be dramatic. In the republicans win the election, we should see a strong bullish impulse. If the democrats does win the election, then the impulse should be bearish, with a long and difficult recovery to the upside trend. Unless, of course, the democrats correct their anti-crypto policies and politicians.

On the chart:
Purple path marks the general trend, that I expect will become true across 2025.
Orange path marks the bearish trend, that as always a possibility exist.



Happy trading !

Current Market Activity: Bitcoin is currently testing the $61,000 top of its range support, a strong resistance level, just ahead of tonight‚Äôs FOMC meeting.

Key Levels:

Range High Support/Resistance: $61,000
Lower Range Support: $57,000‚Äì$58,000
Next Major Resistance: $64,000‚Äì$67,000
Reversal Zone: $66,000‚Äì$68,000 (Required for upside shift)
Potential Outcomes:

Unfavorable FOMC News: BTC could test the $57,000‚Äì$58,000 support.
Favorable FOMC News: A break through $61,000 may lead BTC to the next resistance at $64,000‚Äì$67,000.
Trend Analysis: BTC continues to form lower highs, indicating a broader downtrend. A break and reclaim of the $66,000‚Äì$68,000 zone would suggest a potential reversal, but caution is necessary due to the volatility expected around the FOMC meeting.

BTC Bitcoin golden pocket + Daily level + FOMC meeting zone right now for a nice long. This could get quite volatile with the FOMC meeting hours away so be careful about your stop losses.

Bitcoin surged to an impressive $61,000, fueled by growing excitement ahead of the FOMC's pivotal rate decision. On September 17, BTC ETFs saw a remarkable net inflow of $197 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. As the market eagerly anticipates the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate announcement, speculation is rife, with forecasts divided between a significant 0.25% and 0.5% rate cut. Build easily with Ivan trade union.

Bitcoin has broken the falling trend channel in the short term and reacted strongly up. For the time being, it is difficult to say anything about the future trend direction. The currency is approacing resistance at 61400 points, which may give a negative reaction. However, a break upwards through 61400 points will be a positive signal. The currency is assessed as technically slightly negative for the short term.

Yesterday, we saw a significant and unexpected rise in  Bitcoin , breaking through the sales zone of $59,600-$60,600 (local zone of accumulated volumes), making it a mirror for the buyer.
At the moment, we are squeezed between two volume zones within which we can expect rotation with a priority of breaking upwards. Locally, we have absorption of market sales by cumulative delta, which also indicates a more interested buyer.

In the opposite scenario, we will see a stronger decline and see Bitcoin below $57,500.

 Buy zones:  $60,200-$59,800 (mirror volume zone), ~$55,000 (largest horizontal volume in the last month), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies).

 Sell zones:  $60,800-$61,250 (stopping volume) $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes), $66,100-$68,200 (volume zone).

 Interesting altcoins. 

For the  REEF  coin, we observe one of the most stable long trends in the market at the moment. We trade the asset exclusively in long until the break of the ascending trendline.

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve reviewed the charts, but remember, it‚Äôs always best to focus on  long-term charts  and avoid getting caught up in  short-term noise .  Leverage is gambling ‚Äîit‚Äôs like a casino and can destroy your trust in the crypto system. Stay away from it, and stick to  spot trading only  for reliable and safe growth.

Bitcoin is currently around  60,285 USDT,  holding strong. After a long break from the charts, I'm anticipating a  significant  bullish move in the  coming weeks . The price action suggests that Bitcoin could hit major resistance levels at  82,000 USDT ,  102,000 USDT , and potentially  123,000+ USDT . 

The upcoming  rate cuts and presidential elections  are likely to  impact the economy,  potentially driving a major increase in Bitcoin and crypto values. The flood of crypto news already circulating the internet reflects the growing bullish sentiment, which aligns with the expected price targets and underscores the potential for substantial upward movement.
___
A lot of OI added today, which makes me expect a volatile session tomorrow with FOMC around the corner.

Personally I don't care about the outcome or rate cuts, I'll just trade the chart like I always have.

We cleaned up our poor highs today, but created some new poor highs in the process. Depends a bit on the tick size you use on TPO, but I didn't see any excess or wick structure, short liquidations or OI flush, which you would like to see with such important levels taken.

With poor highs above us and poor lows below us, it's a matter of which get taken first for me.

Poor highs have confluence with CME gap above it, it would make sense to expect some kind of deviation or failed auction above, before selling off if the first move is up.

If we clean up the lows, bulls really want to hold that level; if we don't sfp but accept below, I'd expect much lower prices soon.

So again: if x then y scenario, but on steroids this time.

Yesterday, we broke the inclined line on  Bitcoin , filled the seller's zone deeper, and updated the local low.

At the moment, based on a combination of factors, we can expect a trend change from a locally ascending trend to sideways movement. The decline was accompanied by volume anomalies on the cluster chart, and now we need to position these anomalies, so we are waiting for the resolution and only then opening positions.
We are primarily looking at longs and have noted potential scenarios for the development of events on the chart.

 Buying zones:  $58,300-$56,400 (volume zone), ~$55,000 (largest horizontal volume in the last month), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies).

 Selling zones:  $59,600-$60,600 (local zone of accumulated volumes) $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes), $66,100-$68,200 (volume zone).

 Interesting altcoins. 

For the  TIA  coin, we bounced off an important volume zone, thereby confirming its strength.
On a retest of the local low of 4.48 and a false breakout of this level, we open a long.

In a move that highlights its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, led by its CEO Michael Saylor, has announced a fresh $700 million debt offering to acquire more Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ). This marks the second such offering in just one month as the company aggressively expands its Bitcoin holdings. Known for its bullish stance on Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has now accumulated a staggering 244,800 BTC as part of its Treasury Reserve Asset (TRA) strategy.

The Latest Debt Offering
The newly proposed $700 million debt offering comes in the form of Convertible Senior Notes, which will be available only to qualified institutional investors. MicroStrategy plans to use the proceeds from this offering to redeem $500 million of its 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2028. After settling these debts, the remaining funds will be directed toward acquiring additional Bitcoin and other general corporate purposes.

This is not MicroStrategy's first foray into issuing convertible notes to fund its Bitcoin strategy. The company has previously conducted similar offerings, raising billions of dollars to support its growing Bitcoin portfolio. In June of this year, it made an $800 million offering, followed by a $1.1 billion Bitcoin purchase, which added 18,300 BTC to its reserves.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs Unstoppable Bitcoin Streak
MicroStrategy began its Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) acquisition spree in August 2020, becoming one of the first publicly traded companies to adopt Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) as a primary reserve asset. Over the years, the company has consistently used debt to bolster its Bitcoin reserves, reinforcing its belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

This strategy has often paid off for the company, especially in times of Bitcoin price appreciation. Most notably, MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock (MSTR) has soared as a direct result of its Bitcoin investments. After recent acquisitions, MSTR‚Äôs stock price surged by 18.74%, outpacing the broader market and gaining value even when other stocks faced volatility.

Bitcoin‚Äôs Current Market Dynamics
Despite MicroStrategy's massive Bitcoin purchase plans, the cryptocurrency itself has experienced some downward pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) is down 2% after showing strength in previous weeks. This pullback is intriguing as it comes amid positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin's recent performance and broader adoption.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48, indicating a potential for a bullish reversal. The key pivot point for Bitcoin remains at $70,000, a level that traders and analysts are closely watching. If Bitcoin can break through this resistance, it could set off another significant rally, supported by the increasing institutional interest exemplified by companies like MicroStrategy.

Institutional Impact and MSTR Stock
MicroStrategy‚Äôs continued commitment to Bitcoin reflects a growing trend of institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. With its relentless accumulation of Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ), MicroStrategy is making a bold bet on the long-term potential of the digital asset. As more institutions and corporations follow suit, Bitcoin could further cement its status as a mainstream financial asset.

For MicroStrategy, its aggressive Bitcoin strategy has not only bolstered its stock but also differentiated the company from its peers. MSTR has consistently outperformed other tech stocks, thanks in large part to its Bitcoin holdings. As the company continues to issue convertible debt and acquire more Bitcoin, investors will keep a close eye on both the price of Bitcoin and the value of MSTR stock.

Conclusion
MicroStrategy's latest $700 million debt offering underscores its confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs future. With 244,800  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  already in its reserves and plans to accumulate more, the company is betting on Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) as a core part of its corporate strategy. While Bitcoin faces near-term volatility, the long-term outlook remains promising, especially with institutional players like MicroStrategy continuing to lead the charge. If Bitcoin ( CRYPTOCAP:BTC ) can breach the $70,000 pivot, MicroStrategy‚Äôs bullish strategy could prove even more lucrative for both the company and its investors.
___
Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price action has caught the attention of traders, but there‚Äôs a key element to watch closely: **volume**. Despite testing critical support at **57,000 USDT**, Bitcoin‚Äôs volume remains unusually low, suggesting the potential for increased volatility as selling pressure builds.

### 1. **Volume as a Leading Indicator:**
   - The **24.775K** volume figure on this daily chart indicates a lack of conviction from both buyers and sellers. This low trading volume, coupled with Bitcoin‚Äôs inability to break through significant resistance levels, may signal an incoming sharp move.
   - Low volume near key support levels is often a precursor to a larger move as market participants wait for a clear breakout or breakdown. If the volume spikes and selling intensifies, it could lead to a rapid decline.

### 2. **Price Action:**
   - Bitcoin is currently trading at **57,776 USDT**, hovering near critical support at **57,000 USDT**. While the price hasn‚Äôt yet plunged, the lack of strong volume on upward moves indicates that buyers are hesitant to step in aggressively.
   - In the past few sessions, Bitcoin has failed to hold above the **20-day EMA (58,323 USDT)**, reinforcing the bearish momentum. Without volume to push through resistance, BTC continues to consolidate near the lower range of its price channel.

### 3. **Support and Resistance Levels:**
   - The key support level at **57,000 USDT** is crucial. A breakdown here could trigger a high-volume sell-off, pushing the price down to **49,024 USDT**, which represents a strong area of previous consolidation.
   - On the upside, Bitcoin faces stiff resistance from the **20/50/100-day EMAs**, all of which hover just above the current price. Without a surge in buying volume, a breakout above these levels seems unlikely.

### 4. **Volume Divergence and Trendlines:**
   - The **descending trendline** in the chart reflects the continued presence of selling pressure, with each rally being met by resistance and declining volume. The lack of increasing volume on bullish moves suggests that the price is moving more on inertia than conviction, raising concerns about the sustainability of any upward trend.
   - Historically, a **volume divergence**‚Äîwhere price movement occurs with declining volume‚Äîcan signal that the market is losing steam, setting the stage for a potential reversal.

### 5. **RSI and Market Sentiment:**
   - The **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** sits at **47.34**, signaling neutral momentum. However, with low volume, even a small uptick in selling pressure could push the RSI below **40**, confirming a bearish sentiment.
   - Sentiment in the market seems muted, with neither bulls nor bears taking decisive control. This hesitation reflects low volume, suggesting traders are waiting for a key catalyst before committing fully to the next move.

---

### **Conclusion:**
Low volume near key support levels is a major warning sign for Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. The longer the volume remains low, the more likely it is that a larger, more volatile move is on the horizon. If selling volume increases, Bitcoin could easily break below the **57,000 USDT** support, with potential for a swift decline to **49,024 USDT**. Until volume picks up on the buy side, BTC may remain in a precarious position. Traders should watch volume closely as the determining factor in Bitcoin‚Äôs next major move.
___
Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a critical zone as it struggles to hold above the $57,000 support level. The daily chart suggests that the cryptocurrency is losing momentum, with multiple technical indicators pointing towards a potential bearish breakdown.

### 1. **Price Action and Key Levels:**
   - Bitcoin is currently trading at **57,776 USDT**, down **2.29%** in the latest session. The price has ranged between **59,210 USDT** (high) and **57,493 USDT** (low), reflecting increasing selling pressure.
   - The price has failed to break through the strong resistance around **60,000 USDT**, and the downward sloping trendline indicates that sellers are controlling the market.

### 2. **EMAs Acting as Resistance:**
   - BTC is trading below all key EMAs (20/50/100/200), indicating that the bulls are losing control in both short- and long-term trends. The **20-day EMA** (58,323 USDT) is acting as immediate resistance, followed by the **50-day EMA** (59,523 USDT). The price consistently failing to reclaim these levels reflects persistent bearish sentiment.

### 3. **Descending Trendline Pressure:**
   - A clear **descending trendline** is visible on the chart, connecting recent highs. BTC has been unable to break this trendline, suggesting continued downward pressure and potential for further declines. This trendline acts as a psychological barrier for the bulls, preventing any significant breakout.

### 4. **Support Levels and Bearish Targets:**
   - The key support at **57,000 USDT** is being tested. A break below this level could lead to a sharper decline, with the next major support resting around **49,024 USDT**, which coincides with a previous consolidation zone. Traders should be cautious of a close below this support, as it could signal a prolonged bearish phase.

### 5. **RSI and Momentum:**
   - The **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** is currently at **47.34**, suggesting neutral momentum but edging closer to oversold territory. This indicates that while Bitcoin is not yet in an oversold condition, a continuation of the current trend could push the RSI below **40**, confirming further downside risk.

### 6. **Volume and Market Sentiment:**
   - The **volume** sits at **24.775K**, which is relatively low. This implies that the current move down might not yet have the momentum of a full-scale sell-off, but if selling volume picks up, it could accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs decline towards lower support levels.

---

### **Conclusion:**
Bitcoin is at a crossroads, with key support levels in danger of being breached. If the price fails to hold above **57,000 USDT**, the next target could be **49,024 USDT**. The inability to break through key EMAs and the descending trendline further signals a bearish outlook. Traders should keep an eye on volume and RSI levels to gauge the strength of the selling pressure. A breakdown could signal a prolonged bearish trend, while a bounce from these levels would provide temporary relief.

Hey there, ‚úå 
Bitcoin is currently trading around the $58,500 range. Given the lack of stabilization above the $60,000 level, we could be facing a bearish trend. Additionally, with the recent break below the $59,300 mark, the short-term outlook on the 1-hour chart appears bearish.

We expect that after completing a pullback, the price may move towards the corrective targets of $57,500, $57,000, $56,700, and $56,000.
‚ùå Key resistance levels to watch are around $59,000 and $59,700.

Bitcoin (BTC): $58,862.35 (-2.07%)
Bitcoin Dominance: 57.95%
Fear and Greed Index: 39 (fear) 

  WHAT HAPPENED? 

Last week, bitcoin reached the important $53,000-$50,000 buy zone (large volume anomalies), received a reaction, broke through the downward sloping line and continued to grow.

A new upward sloping line has been formed, within which we continue to trade until now. 

The sell zone of $58,700-$59,400 (mirrored volume zone) didn‚Äôt give a reaction, but, on the contrary, was broken through ‚Äî this also gave confidence to buyers. 

  WHAT WILL HAPPEN: OR NOT? 

We tested a new buy zone of $58,300-$56,400 (volume zone) and got an initial reaction. A repeat test of the buy zone and a potentially deeper test of this zone are likely. 

Locally, in order to resume a full-fledged upward movement, it‚Äôs necessary to gain a foothold above the price of ~$59,600. The sell area and the $63,000 level will serve as a benchmark for growth in the near future.

 Buy zones:  $58,300-$56,400 (volume zone), ~$55,000 (the largest horizontal volume in the last month), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies).

 Sell zones:  $63,000-$64,300 (accumulated volume zone), $66,100-$68,200 (volume zone).

üìä#BTC reaches support zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†We fell back as expected after being blocked by the periodic resistance zone, and constructed a bearish double top structure in the resistance zone. Currently, all the goals of this structure have been achieved, and the target zone overlaps with our neckline and yellow support zone. The overlapping The section is considered the heaviest support area.

‚û°Ô∏èSo we placed some new long orders in this support area. The rebound has already appeared. With the winning rate, whether we can make big profits depends on whether we can build a long structure with the same cycle here.

‚ö†Ô∏èWe have currently moved our stop loss up and are in a risk-free state, so we can expect more. If you want to participate, you need to wait until the long structure here is established before entering. The next strong support is around 55000-55800.

Last weeks high: $60,638.89 
Last weeks low: $54,371.86
Midpoint: 57,505.38

Bitcoins price action mirrored that of the week that proceeded it, with a steady climb from the start of the week, peaking on Friday close, witha weekend sell off to end the week. Looking at the chart the Midpoint needs to hold if there is a chance of continuing the rally beyond $60,000. I could see price action being nervy until the FOMC in midweek.

Last week we saw BTC go through multiple news events such as CPI, PPI in the US but also the ECB rate cut decision. The European central bank cut the interest rate from 4.25% to 3.65%, a cut of 60bps. 
This news has flown under the radar in my opinion, not many people are reporting on it could play a part in the FEDs decision on Wednesday. So far the rate cut looks to be a 25bps reduction from 5.50% to 5.25%. That leaves the US significantly higher than Europe and so in theory Europe would have the opportunity to be more risk-on than America as credit is cheaper. 
I would think that the US wouldn't like this and would seek to do something about it, that something would be a bigger cut, a 50bps cut closer to the ECB would bring the US more inline. Naturally this being the beginning of the rate cut cycle it's a marathon not a sprint and although the ECB started out strong the cuts may taper off sooner than the US, that's a whole different story but for this week this is the big focus.

CRYPTOCAP:BTC  has reversed after dropping to  GETTEX:52K  (falling channel in orange) and is now recovering on the 1D chart. On the 1W chart, there is also a sign of reversal and RSI too.

My forecast is that before taking off,  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  will strengthen within this rising channel (in blue). There's strong support at $47- GETTEX:48K , which should hold.

Based on the RSI and MACD curves, the uptrend should continue until it reaches the resistance at $67-$68k. Afterward, I anticipate a more severe correction, but the price should remain within the rising channel for some time.

The parabolic phase hasn't started yet, so I expect another drop to the bottom of the wedge before the next big move begins.

I will update this idea as it develops.

Most of my previous ideas have been accurate, so feel free to check them out and follow me for more forecasts.

This technical study relies on weekly timeframe observations, highlighting key technical patterns and volume dynamics that suggest a bullish outlook. As of today‚Äôs date (9:26pmAST), the 24-hour long volume stands at $28.59B, underscoring significant long interest in the market. With precise data from the weekly chart, the confluence of multiple bullish indicators suggests the potential for a retest or breakout beyond the all-time high.


Analysis:
 Cup and Handle Formation : The first significant observation is the development of a classic Cup and Handle pattern, widely regarded as a bullish continuation pattern. This pattern, forming over a prolonged period, indicates a consolidation phase followed by potential upward momentum. The handle represents a minor retracement, which often precedes a breakout to the upside.

 Parallel Channel and Key Levels : Starting from the previous peak at 73,777, a parallel channel has been drawn down to the recent bottom at 52,550. This channel defines the current price action, showing a well-respected range within which the price has oscillated. The recent price action has been bouncing within the lower bounds of this channel, signaling that the market may be gearing up for a decisive move. The current trajectory suggests that if momentum continues, we could see a breakout of this channel, potentially pushing the price back toward the all-time high.

 EMA Support and Price Action : Another critical factor is the price's bounce off the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which serves as a key support level. Historically, the 50-day EMA is a strong indicator of trend direction, and the recent bounce suggests renewed buying pressure. This move reinforces the bullish outlook and could indicate a sustained push toward breaking or retesting the all-time high.

With the formation of the Cup and Handle pattern, the support from the 50-day EMA, and the market respecting the parallel channel, all signals point to a potential bullish breakout. The current long volume of $28.59B adds further confirmation of buying interest, aligning with the technical patterns that favor upside potential.

Remember Today: If BTC futures break 61,766 in a week and stay above that line, we are looking at a new uptrend-sideway range between 60-80K between October - February 2024, and March 2025 if the trend has no rejection due to sentiment of the market is positive we will be looking 90-100K new range in history of BTC, should you take your position now and best of luck!

Here's an idea nobody are talking about but it is one that is to be considered. If BTC were to follow these 2 trendline, i'll be wanting to accumulate in the golden ratio zone 28-30K before the real bounce up to 85K++. I hope this opportunity do come which flushes out short term investors and invites new long term investors to come in at 30K. Timeline for this might be 12-18 months since i've charted this using the monthly chart.

time to update my previously idea 
The price of Bitcoin has followed path B and has been moving sideways for some time. Partly, this was due to very weak data from the U.S. labor market. A few months ago, bulls were anticipating this weakness, but now they are afraid because it has started to smell like a recession. Mr. Powell already announced on August 23 that "the time has come," and now monetary policy will be eased. There is a consensus in the market that the rate will be lowered in September, although many are expecting an immediate reduction of 50 bp. I agree with the opinion that there will be a 25 bp reduction, as a 50 bp cut would be an acknowledgment by the Federal Reserve that they erred by delaying the start of the reduction and could cause additional panic among investors. I don't think it could happen 1.5 months before the elections.

Also, additional reasons for growth are stock market buybacks in September/October and payments from FTX of about $16 billion in October.

So yes, I'm sure that the bottom has already been passed and it's only up from here

Hello People

This is what is going on with bitcoin in my eyes after a long time of not posting any ideas.

BTC on daily timeframe is in a weak downtrend kind of a bull flag but dont let the flag fool you, they could fail just like any other pattern or candle formations.

our job is to assess risk and trade in the side of higher probabilities.
At the moment on H4 time frame as you can see BTC looks like to be forming a right shoulder if you want to look at it as a H&S pattern or just simply look at it as a lower high point obviously after printing that lower low at $52500, currently hovering at %50 retracement of the bearish leg that started on Sun 25 Aug. I've highlighted a dark blue zone which is exactly between %50-%61.8 fib which is very likely to act as a strong resistance. the next bearish leg would take BTC down to 47k-46k zone, my target to get out is set at 47k mark. risk to reward wise we are in a good situation which is 3 to 1, in my opinion trading is all about good enough risk/reward ratio and trying to be on the higher probability side of the market in other words trading what you see. even the best setups can fail so be smart.

let's see how the market unfolds.
cheers
___
Here is the daily target to reach for BTC. I expect a possible range with a fake pump to let retails to long. Then, we will probably see a drop until the $57.200 area, where there is enough liquidity for Bitcoin. This is a magnet level, and I will DCA a short entry with an easy invalidation above $59.500
___
Yet again, BTC continues to chop in a very small price range shown between the trend lines.

 Next target after reclaiming daily s/r would be around $64.4, within the following POB.

FA: The majority of crypto market participants are currently in a depressed mood regarding the medium-term future of the crypto market as a whole. Such behavior of the crowd says first of all that weak hands are not ready to buy now, and the sawtooth movement, which started since March and has lasted for more than 6 months, puts even experienced participants in a stupor, forcing them to close speculative positions, dump risky assets and expect a further decline comparable to the collapse in the spring of 2020.

However, a deeper look reveals several significant trends:

A drop in the influx of new bitcoins to exchanges.
Since the beginning of the year, the number of new coins entering exchanges has been declining. This indicates that professional investors prefer to keep their assets in their wallets, which means they are not preparing to sell. This factor is traditionally considered to be a bullish sign, as a decrease in supply on exchanges may contribute to price growth in case of renewed buying activity.

Increased outflow of bitcoins from exchanges.
This sign is also positive and confirms the narrative of asset accumulation by smart capital. It can be seen especially well at the moment of price drawdown: during and after aggressive shakeouts, a surge in coin outflows is clearly visible. 

Despite the globally passive sentiment, the fundamentals of exchange inflow/outflow suggest that strong hands continue to accumulate while the crowd is perplexed by what is happening.

Reduced supply on the exchanges and increased demand from large holdings are creating all the conditions for future price gains, our idea is that the market has been in a reaccumulative phase for the past six months.

From a  technical analysis standpoint , I anticipate a continued downside for BTC. Two potential scenarios may unfold:

1 - Retest of the 4-hour Order Block (OB): BTC could test the 52,000-54,000 range, followed by a gradual reversal, suggesting a more measured recovery.

2 - Retest of the Weekly Fair Value Gap (FVG): Alternatively, BTC may drop to the 47,300-44,000 zone, which could trigger a sharp "V-shaped" reversal with aggressive momentum driving the price higher, potentially towards new all-time highs (ATH).


In either case, monitoring key support and resistance levels within these zones will be critical.
___
BTC is currently stuck in this price range. It can turn bullish if it breaks the structure.
___
red lines  - sell or watch zone for bull trend continuation
 orange lines  - touch already
 green lines  - accumulation zone (with DCA)

 BULLRUN  confirmation after 69000 retest (at least on small tf).
 BEARMARKET?  we don`t talk things like this here :)

But personally i think that we have around 40% chance for a new low under 47000.

Altcoins? other story...NOV or next year
___
it is set to sweeping the trend line liquidity to the resistance level at 61447 right after which we will return to bear market continuation which if the current LL fail to hold 40k will be the next target

Take noted the below is not an investment advise, bet at your own risk. I am solely not responsible for any of your loses in money or assets.

The Current Bitcoin price is USDT26221.12 as of 26 September 2023.

The Bitcoin have potential to drop to USDT24292.54 range in the coming 1.5 months before the Fed's FOMC in November 2023.

The price will hover between USDT24292.54 to about USDT29240.33 within this period.

Potential strong tailwind is the pause of US Fed's rate hike this coming November 2023. This will drive and test the resistance level at USDT29240.33. If there is a breakout then the next level of stronger resistance based on the dynamic resistance will be at USDT31334.78. If there is a breakout at USD31K plus then the next power strong 1 week resistance at USDT63665.58

Potential strong headwind will drive the market to around USDT24292.54 because of higher rate for longer by Fed's US. If next 1.5 months down the road if there is other or fews strong headwinds appears then the price might breakout from USDT24292.54 and head lower to a super stronger support of 1 month chart at USDT14576.47. This is highly unlikely to happen withing next few months as the Fed's is data dependent and also depend of the next 6 months' data to say that they will maintain the Fed's funds rate for longer. Still I think is not clear at the moment that the Fed's need higher for longer for 2 years.

USDT14576.47 is a very strong support level based on the 1-month chart of Bitcoin. I would only start buying a little at USDT24292.54 and reassess for 2 to 3 weeks before buying more. If by the time Bitcoin reach USDT24292.54 and the S&P most likely have no reach 3900. The Bitcoin might go lower following the S&P 500 going to 3900.

Based on current market condition it is highly unlikely to get a low that surpasses last year October 2022 bottom. However, the future for a US recession is unclear currently as there is both camp of soft landing and a recession.
___
so at this point price can go either ways since there's a bullish flag and a bearish trend at the same time...so lets be cautious about our trades
___
I'm seeing that the price of bitcoin could explode at any time. However, I'm starting to notice weakness in the bounce so I've taken the opportunity to make a short entry as it hasn't broken strongly above the 4h FVG and only went up for liquidity.

  


Trade management: SL in the wick in case it resumes the upward bias better get out of the way. TP on the swing low.
Risking capital: 0.50%.
RR: 2.7
___
In this idea, we are considering a stop-hunt to the  GETTEX:59K  region due to the CPI data coming out differently than expected. At 14:30 CEST to 16:00 you can expect a lot of volatility during this time. Liquidation charts show a cluster of about $1.2b at around $58.7k.

#BTC #Bitcoin #Update #Setup 15 #Eddy


I don't know the main reason why I changed my mind from a sharp market fall, but at least I know that I used to take Bitcoin from the $25,000 range to very large targets, but it makes sense to introduce this setup to you. On the monthly time frame Bitcoin has closed above the previous ceiling with the body of the candle and on the other hand we have a valid exchange range that can support Bitcoin and cannot be ignored, but the market maker always surprised us. If I were to act like a sniper, the setup I have considered is suitable for the stated objectives, but I have marked the important support areas for you anyway, including the weekly block order I specified with WOB and finally If the monthly block order area I specified with Mob is gone. , we can see the drop until we reach the target of our previous 14 setup. & Do not forget that the WOB area should not be neglected.

Bitcoin Update: Tuesday, 10th September 2024

Good evening to all my brothers and sisters. 

Yesterday, Bitcoin made a significant jump, as I had predicted in my analysis. On the 4-hour chart, it broke through all key support and resistance levels, placing the price firmly in a bullish zone. However, on the daily time frame, the price remains under the first resistance (marked by Arrow #3).

 What‚Äôs Next?
If the price manages to hold above or moves further up from this daily resistance, we could see a potential jump to near the $59,000 level. However, if the price breaks below the blue lines, this would indicate that the recent upward movement was merely a retracement rather than a trend reversal. In that case, we could expect a significant drop.

But even in the event of a decline, there are still two major support levels that remain valid (marked by Arrow #5 and Arrow #6). These are key pivot points on both the daily and weekly time frames, so they‚Äôll be critical to watch.

 Altcoins Performance
Altcoins have also started moving positively following Bitcoin‚Äôs jump yesterday. I‚Äôve already shared several signals on my channels, and I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for more opportunities. Once we see confirmation of Bitcoin breaking the black line, I‚Äôll be looking to add more coins to our watchlist.

Make sure you have your notifications turned on and stay tuned for more updates. 

Wishing you all a great day ahead!

Nice to meet you. I'm Whale_signal

I updated 1H - BTCUSDT yesterday, and there's over $1,000 upside from orange whale indicators

Up to the peak of 58K, it's more than $3,000, and I've posted exactly this elsewhere


Today's 1H - BTCUSDT update

Even if it breaks above the 58K purple whale index, the direction will likely be different depending on the flow from the purple whale index around 59K to 59.2K

It looks like you need the power to break through 59K to 59.2K to get a foothold on the rise
It's an important whale indicator section


I'll stop here for today

Hello,

The trend is currently ranging between 70022.00 and 52741.67, so some additional patience will be required for this market.

We have a major resistance level at 67826.31, which is keeping the price trending bearish below 60336.81. We might see a minor bullish pulse followed by a drop to a lower low at Elliott Wave 4, or the bullish pulse could be significant enough to reach previous highs. This condition indicates a ranging market.

If the market drops to the Elliott Wave 4 low, it will still be uncertain whether that low will hold as support or break. For now, only if the price goes above 71773.89 and forms a strong higher low will there be potential for a market shift to bullish. Until that happens, this remains a bear market.

The current market structure is H-L-(H)-LH, and the LL is in question because a HH did not properly form for "(H),"  making 72525.81 the argument of the current price due to pin rejection.

 Overall conclusion : The market is currently in a state of uncertainty, oscillating within defined ranges. Watch for key support and resistance levels and potential shifts in market structure and such key levels at 60336.81 and 71773.89. Any significant movement above these figures could indicate a potential shift in market dynamics, - but until then, the bearish sentiment is likely to persist.

Happy Trading,
K.

Hello trader's
Here is your bitcoin next move update so 
carefully watch this level for of my box breakout
either it go up or break it down...
so be ready and miss to follow for updates...

BTCUSDT is trending downward toward the lower end of its consolidation zone. The market has been fluctuating between 52K and 72K since April. Now, it looks poised to retest the bottom of this range, especially after breaking and closing below the key psychological level at 60K. On the weekly timeframe, the price also broke and closed below the prior week's low, forming a significant bearish candle. This suggests that bearish momentum may continue. The target is the support level at 54,000
___
We could see a rapid rally on Monday that will last until Wednesday when the CPI data is released. We are currently in a mean reversion as show with the arrow. We broke through the ema50 and are retesting it right now. The order books are also pointing to $56k as there is a lot of liquidity in the form of orders looking to be filled.

Cup and Handle Pattern: 

The Cup: The chart shows a rounded bottom formation that resembles a cup, often indicative of a longer consolidation period before a breakout.

The Handle: After the cup formation, the price appears to be forming a handle, which is a short-term downtrend before the breakout. The handle often slopes downwards slightly, and once the price breaks out of the handle's resistance line, a significant move upwards can follow.

 Key Resistance Level: 
The resistance seems to be around the $65,000 - $70,000 level. A breakout above this area would likely indicate a continuation of the previous bullish trend.

 Volume Analysis: 
The chart shows increasing volume during the cup formation, which is a healthy sign for the bullish pattern. However, it looks like volume has decreased slightly in the handle phase, which is normal for this pattern. An increase in volume during a breakout from the handle would confirm the strength of the upward move.

 RSI (Relative Strength Index): 
The RSI is currently at 57.21, which is neutral. It indicates there is still room for upward movement before entering overbought territory (above 70). This supports the bullish view if the price breaks out.

 Stochastic Oscillator: 
The Stochastic indicator shows a value of 61.68 (blue), which is also relatively neutral but trending upward. If the stochastic continues its upward movement, it may suggest a potential entry point for buyers before hitting overbought conditions.

 VM Candle Divergences: 

The chart uses a custom indicator (VMC Cipher Divergences), which might show some bullish divergence, but it requires confirmation through volume and momentum changes.
Prognosis:
If the handle breakout occurs above the resistance line (~$65,000), the next bullish target would be near previous all-time highs, around $75,000 or higher.
A failure to break the handle's resistance could lead to a short-term pullback to test lower support levels around $50,000.

 Market Outlook: 

Bullish Case: A successful breakout would lead to a continuation of the uptrend, and the price could target $75,000 - $80,000 in the next phase.

Bearish Case: Failure to break resistance at around $65,000 may lead to a correction back to $50,000 - $45,000, where stronger support lies.

This analysis leans toward a bullish outlook, as the technical pattern suggests a breakout might be imminent. However, monitoring volume and momentum indicators will be key for confirming the next move.

Greetings,

Among crypto traders, there is always a saying called "Uptober". You might be wondering, is it a bit too early to buy Bitcoin considering it's still early in the September? Well, check the institutional buying pressure from 50K to 53K, it's pretty unlikely Bitcoin will dip bellow 52K. While the macro economy embracing a soft landing, Bitcoin is destined to outperform S&P 500. In other words, money will  pull out from the stock market and flow into bonds and crypto.  

The strategy is simple, Buy bitcoin now and sell around the end of November. The probability to take profit around Nov 28th is very attractive.

Happy trading!

Technical Analysis of the Chart by Bla≈æ Fabjan: 

 Descending Trading Channel: 

BTC is trading within a descending channel, showing lower highs and lower lows, which typically signals a downtrend. However, it is nearing the bottom of the channel, often a zone for potential reversal.

 Support and Resistance Zones: 

Support: The two orange zones indicate strong support areas around $51,000 and $50,000. BTC may find buying pressure in these regions, especially as it touches the lower bound of the descending channel.
Resistance: The current resistance area is around $55,000. BTC will need to break through this level to confirm a trend reversal.

 Indicators: 

RSI (Relative Strength Index): RSI is currently around 55, indicating a neutral trend. However, it is slightly moving upwards, suggesting potential bullish momentum, though not overbought yet.
Stochastic Oscillator: This is showing a crossover at 74, indicating upward momentum, but it‚Äôs close to the overbought region. This may signal some resistance to immediate bullish continuation.

VMC Cipher B Divergences: This indicator is showing bullish divergences at several points, signaling potential reversal zones. Divergence with price action suggests a potential trend change in the near term.

 Trading Plans: 

 1. Intraday Trading Plan: 
Strategy:
Trade within the current channel. Watch for a breakout from the descending channel, especially on the 1-hour chart.
A breakout above the $55,000 level could confirm a short-term bullish move.
Look for pullbacks towards the $53,500-$54,000 region to enter long positions, targeting $55,500.
Place a stop loss just below $53,000 to protect against fake breakouts.
Indicators to Watch:
RSI trending above 60.
Stochastic Oscillator maintaining bullish momentum.

 2. Scalping Strategy: 
Strategy:
Focus on small price fluctuations within the support and resistance zones.
Look for quick entries near the support zones (around $53,500) and exits before it hits resistance ($55,000).
Scalping in tight time frames (5 to 15 minutes) around these price levels.
Key Levels:
Enter around $53,500 and exit at $54,500.
Place tight stop-loss orders around $53,000 to manage risk.

 3. Swing Trading Strategy: 
Strategy:
If BTC continues trading within this descending channel, wait for a breakout confirmation to take a long position.
A breakout above the channel and $55,500 would signal a strong move upwards, potentially to $58,000 or higher.
Enter long positions if BTC breaks and holds above the $55,500 resistance level, targeting $58,000 and beyond.
In case of a further dip, enter long positions around $50,000 support, which appears to be a strong reversal point.
Stop Loss: Below $50,000.

 Conclusion and Long Position Advice: 

Near-Term (Intraday): BTC could break above the descending channel, leading to a short-term bullish move towards $55,500. Watch closely for a breakout confirmation. You could consider entering long positions on pullbacks or a confirmed breakout.

Medium-Term (Swing Trading): A solid break of the $55,500 resistance could lead to a potential rally towards $58,000. Be cautious of potential false breakouts and place stop-losses below support levels.

Scalping: For those aiming for quicker profits, you can take advantage of price fluctuations within the $53,500-$55,000 range.

Overall, the chart shows signs of a potential bullish reversal, especially if BTC breaks out of the descending channel. For now, conservative traders may wait for a breakout confirmation before entering long positions. However, aggressive traders can consider buying near support levels, keeping in mind the risk of downward movement in case of failure to break resistance.

analysis
- price is still relatively "high" at +50k range but consolidation is prolonged hence all STF technical are all ready under water turning bearish

- only weekly now at the touch for EMA, which can be a support for a bounce i.e it either bounce here for relieve, otherwise if broken, that's one of the worst scenario. so decision point is near, with liquidity problem, hand on there (currently similar to HTF of 2021)

- however, on LTF,  price is weak under water. silver lining is Daily time frame is testing support with higher low (reminder low was 49k, a test around low under 55k is understandably expected)

strategy is

- hold on to position based on weekly time frame
- watch out for daily, do I want to scalp around ETH (ETH is very very weak under consideration that ETH is live), SOL turn out to be much better alternative with price holding +$125, whereas ETH is already 30% down from $3300 to $2300. A scalp from ETH to SOL at range low is prudent or not ?
- blessing in disguise with own fund. let's just wait. think from another perpspective of already secured land/deal. take the time
- if price crash, which break low 49k, then need serious reconsideration of both trading/investment plan and use of fund plan (but it may take time because price is still around $55k and mkt is slow)

The "Market Direction" indicator combines four advanced sub-indicators to provide a comprehensive and multi-dimensional analysis of market trends, momentum, and potential reversals. This innovative approach leverages different aspects of price action, volume, and market sentiment, offering traders an in-depth view of market conditions.

 1. Fractal Indicator: Multi-Scale Price Action Analysis 
The Fractal Indicator identifies significant highs and lows over six different pivot lengths, offering a nuanced view of price action across multiple timeframes. By comparing distances from current closing prices to these key fractal points, the indicator determines potential trend reversals and market direction. This approach enables traders to adapt their strategies to various market conditions, capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

 2. Volume MACD Indicator: Enhanced Market Momentum 
The Volume MACD Indicator goes beyond traditional MACD analysis by incorporating volume-weighted movement and the structural attributes of candlesticks (such as body length and wicks). This hybrid model offers a more comprehensive understanding of market momentum by integrating both price action and trading volume. The use of Smoothed Moving Averages (SMMA) reduces noise and ensures more stable signals, helping traders focus on sustainable trends and longer-term investment opportunities.

 3. Cumulative Volume Momentum Indicator: Volume Dynamics Insight 
The Cumulative Volume Momentum Indicator evaluates the momentum of cumulative buying and selling volumes, offering a clear picture of market strength and potential reversals. By comparing the relationship between open, close, high, and low prices, and applying a MACD approach to these volume dynamics, this indicator helps traders identify momentum shifts that often precede price movements. The visualization through histograms adds clarity to bullish and bearish volume momentum, enhancing decision-making in volatile markets.

 4. POC-Price Momentum Indicator: Market Depth and Sentiment 
The POC-Price Momentum Indicator assesses the difference between the Point of Control (POC) and closing prices, providing insights into underlying market sentiment. Positive differences indicate a buildup of upward momentum, while negative differences suggest a bearish tilt. By calculating moving averages of these differences, the indicator highlights the strength and sustainability of ongoing trends, helping traders align their strategies with the broader market direction.

 Unified Rating for Confirming Market Direction 
The "Market Direction" indicator consolidates the outputs of these four sub-indicators into a single, aggregated sentiment score. This score helps traders confirm the prevailing market trend by weighing the combined insights from fractal analysis, volume momentum, price action, and POC dynamics. A positive score suggests a bullish market, while a negative score indicates bearish conditions.
___
Main Concept 
 
 The core idea behind the Super Trend Reversals indicator is to assess the momentum of automated trading bots (often referred to as 'Supertrend bots') that enter the market during critical turning points. Specifically, the indicator is tuned to identify when the market is nearing bottoms or peaks, but just before it shifts direction based on the triggered Supertrend signals. This approach helps traders engage with the market right as the reversal momentum builds up, allowing for entry just as conditions become favorable and exit before momentum wanes.
 
 How It Works 
 
 The Super Trend Reversals uses multiple Supertrend calculations, each with different period and multiplier settings, to form a comprehensive view of the trend. The total trend score from these calculations is then analyzed using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to gauge the strength and sustainability of the trend.
 A key feature of this indicator is the isCurrentRangeSmaller() function, which evaluates if the current price range is lower than the average over the recent period. This function is critical as it helps determine the stability of the market environment, reducing the likelihood of entering or exiting trades based on erratic price movements that could lead to false signals.

-------------------------------------



USDT, USDC seem to have gapped up as the weekend approaches.

I think the gapped up is a sign of funds flowing into the coin market.



The rise in USDT dominance is likely to lead to a decline in the coin market.

However, since funds flow into the coin market through USDT, I think that USDT dominance will show an upward trend in the medium to long term when considering it from a medium to long term perspective.

When funds flowing into the coin market purchase coins and tokens, USDT or USDC flow back into the exchange, which is expressed as a decline in USDT dominance.

Therefore, I think that in order for a large bull market in the coin market to begin, USDT dominance will start to decline after a large rise.


In that sense, the 4.97 point of USDT dominance is expected to be an important turning point.

If USDT dominance rises above 6.39, the coin market is likely to show a large decline.

I think that if it rises above 6.39 and then falls to the 4.97-6.39 range, the coin market is likely to form a bottom range.

My personal hope is that it will fall after receiving resistance near 6.39 ~ Fibonacci ratio 0.75.

If that happens, I think the coin market will already be on an uptrend before it is recognized as a bottom.

We need to see whether individual investors will recognize it as a bottom and give them a buying opportunity, or whether they will not give them a buying opportunity.


In that sense, I expect the volatility period around September 13 to be a meaningful period.


In fact, this volatility period is the period set on the 1W chart.

Therefore, the actual volatility period is the week before and after September 16.

In other words, if expressed as a 1-day period, it corresponds to September 9-29.

The strong support zone is expected to be around 42K-43K.

I think this is the zone that most people are expecting.

Therefore, if we give individual investors a buying opportunity as I mentioned earlier, I think it will touch around 42K-43K.

If we do not give individual investors a buying opportunity, it is expected to turn upward near the M-Signal indicator on the 1M chart.

In other words, it is expected to touch around the Fibonacci ratio of 0.707 (48064.07) ~ 0.786 (51606.42) and turn upward.

-

When looking at the NAS100USD chart, we need to check if the StochRSI indicator enters the oversold zone again when a new candle is created.

The important zone is the 17854.8 point.

If it falls below this point, it is likely to touch the Fibonacci ratio 0.618 (17141.4) on the right.

Therefore, I expect the trend to form after the volatility period of BTC that I mentioned earlier.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after it rises above 29K.

The expected range to touch in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.

BTC in green support zone.

Not interested in a long here on this double bottom there is no volume to support it on the 2hr and the daily is showing signs that volume is consistent for further down moves.

Only entertaining a long position if it traps off that next low, honestly isn't a great low since that was a panic move from the Japan blow out so I'm dubious if there will be much reaction there and price action suggest it just caught a lot of people off guard.  Only a V shaped reversal for now.

For a short continuation price has to break that low and find some price acceptance and some sort of channel to form, be looking for a pull back to trap off one of the lower highs made.

Using candle close above 21EMA on daily or 2hr setup of a similar nature.  V shaped with a solid 2hr close candle across the EMA with an increase in volume.  No volume, then no entry.

Probably Bitcoin price didn't completed downtrend yet. There's diamond and cup formations for that possibility. 

 Diamond Formation 

The price forming a diamond view since the last $70K times and you can see that by looking at purple lines.

Diamond formation works as bearish formation if the price already in uptrend process. But diamond formation also works as bullish if the price already in downtrend process. Bitcoin was rising since early 2023. So i think that formation will work as bearish and will push the price down this time.

Formation's mid line shows $58.6K. So if the price can hold that level it can gain more momentum towards to upside. Otherwise mid term target of the formation is $34K -  GETTEX:36K  range.

 Cup Formation 

There's also cup formation probability. If diamond structure works as bearish price will want to touch to cup formation's line at the bottom. It's diamond formation's target at the same time. (Red box below)

Hello again!
Based on D1 chart, we see strong downtrend to the BTC and also based on the news whales are still going to sell their asset. Will this continue to break the level of  based from previous market structure support? Let's wait and see. 

I'm setting the trend advanced if the trend continues to go down to the next previous level of structure as it respect the flow.

Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase this September, with a Descending Broadening Wedge pattern forming on both the weekly and daily charts. This pattern typically signals potential volatility, and we are now approaching the descending support trendline, which also aligns with the wick from the sharp price dump on August 5th. This region, around 48K, is likely to be tested in the coming days as the market seeks to sweep liquidity.

 Key Support Zones to Watch:  
Crucial Support Zone 1: The first line of defense. If Bitcoin holds here, we could start seeing signs of bullish momentum returning.
Crucial Support Zone 2: A deeper level of support. Breaking below this zone could lead to a more extended bearish trend.

In the event that these levels are broken and confirmation bearish candles start forming, we could see Bitcoin testing 42K, 40K, and even 36K in the weeks ahead. However, if Bitcoin holds these zones and begins to print higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL), it would be an early sign that the downtrend might be over.

Also an important element in this setup is the 100-day EMA, which aligns perfectly with Crucial Support Zone 2. This adds a layer of confidence that the price may find strong support here. The confluence of the 100-day EMA with this key support level suggests that a touch of this zone could trigger the next major move, potentially kickstarting a rally.

 Strategy for Traders: 
Swing Traders/Spot Traders: Pay close attention to the support zones, as these levels could present excellent buying opportunities. A bounce from these areas might indicate the start of a new rally, so it‚Äôs time to prepare and fill your bags.

Scalpers: Be mindful of the resistance zones. The price may spike slightly before retesting lower levels, providing potential shorting opportunities. Watch closely for a "soft" or "hard" landing around 50K-48K.

 Caution: Bull Trap Alert 
If Bitcoin encounters a pump in the near term, be cautious about falling into a bull trap. All signs currently point to a retest of the 50K and 48K zones as highly probable, so don‚Äôt get caught up in premature optimism.
___
BTC ended up in a complex WXY correction. Initially what may have seemed like a FLAT ended up being WXY. No matter how much the MM  plays with the market and no matter what news hits the screen, algos always run their course guys. 

We are in the early formation of wave 3, which will make history. True we may retrace a bit more to tap the lower levels but this will sling shot BTC to the ATH ! Remember the deeper the retracement of wave 2, the higher will be wave 3, a slingshot - - get it ;). Mega hidden bullish divergence on the weekly also playing out well. 

Invalidation of this idea is at the low of Wave Y. WorD of advice guys, avoid over leverage and practice risk management fells. DCA is the name of the game. When Bitcoin hits ATH, all ALTS will pop like fireworks hence DCA and Spot Buy is the name of the game, especially for all the young bucks and inspiring traders out there.

There are 3 Strong Support lines under the price, the weekly channels bottom line + MA50 at (53500$), Long term monthly trend line at ( 51500$ apx.) and the main support at 38500$ the 100&200 moving averages.
what i see , the chart is dropping down the cowards and then we could observe the main bullish trend .
as i mentioned before due to weekly cup pattern we can predict to reach 115k$ or pessimistically at least 95k$ for this autumn.

Conclusion & Trading Strategy

Short-Term (Next Few Days)

	‚Ä¢	Bearish Sentiment: Short-term RSI and price action are pointing toward bearish momentum.
	‚Ä¢	Support Zones: Look for support around $52,000; if broken, expect the price to fall toward $44,000.
	‚Ä¢	Resistance: Any attempt to break higher will face resistance at $59,560 and $61,407.
	‚Ä¢	Strategy: Consider shorting Bitcoin if it breaks below $52,000. Target $44,000 with a stop-loss above $61,000.

Medium-Term (Next Few Weeks)

	‚Ä¢	Correction Likely: If Bitcoin fails to regain $59,000, it may correct toward $44,000 or even $37,671 (0.618 Fib level).
	‚Ä¢	Bullish Scenario: If Bitcoin rebounds from $52,000, it may retest $59,000.
	‚Ä¢	Strategy: Wait for a clear bounce around $44,000 or a breakdown below $52,000 before entering a trade.

Long-Term (Next Few Months)

	‚Ä¢	Uptrend Intact: Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term uptrend remains intact unless it breaks below $37,000.
	‚Ä¢	Potential Highs: Bitcoin can retest $70,000 if it holds $50,000-52,000.
	‚Ä¢	Strategy: Long-term holders should consider buying around $44,000 with a target toward $70,000.

Risk: Be cautious of external factors like regulatory news or macroeconomic changes that may affect Bitcoin‚Äôs price.

Hello, I'm Whale_signal

Before that, we'll review the 1H-BTCUSDT chart

The problematic spot was an hour stick, showing a flow of settling the orange whale surface, and then a sharp drop came out immediately

There are probably people who hosted LONG on that spot

1. If you have made a buy on Whale Indicators, you should designate an entry price cut right away
-> Whale indicators are strong indicators, so if they break, which direction? We don't know how much the price will be pushed
-> Profit is important, but risk response comes first

2. There's been a $250 rise from the orange whale indicator and $250 in the futures market is definitely not a small profit
-> Even if you didn't eat $250, you could have avoided a big loss if you designated it as a stopper

I don't feel good because there might be people who lost money. From now on, please make sure to proceed with the stoppage


1H - BTCUSDT Update


It's a very complicated seat. I think it'll help, so I've added a white whale indicator

If it fails to rise above the orange whale index, it could continue to face downward pressure, and if it deviates below, it could see mid to late 46K to late 47K

And if the mid to late 46K to 47K are also breached, please refer to the 1D-BTCUSDT purple whale indicator

You have to be careful because it's continuously being pushed down and it's located under the purple whale indicator

In the trading universe, whether you choose to buy, sell, or hold, remember that patience isn't just a virtue; it's your superpower. It's what keeps you from jumping into a wormhole just because it's there. So, equip yourself with analysis, arm yourself with strategy, but most importantly, cloak yourself in patience. In the grand space opera of trading, those who wait often find the best planets to land on. 

And always keep in mind, as any space trader would tell you, "In the market, as in space, timing isn't everything; it's the only thing."

Trade Idea: Bottom for Bitcoin Might Be In

This chart suggests that Bitcoin may have found its bottom, with the potential for a bullish reversal. The following elements highlight this outlook:

 1. Liquidity Zones: 
   - Liquidity/TP1: The chart highlights a take-profit zone (TP1) near the $64,000 level, where liquidity is expected to reside. This is the target area for the long trade.
   - Prev. Monthly High: This is noted above the $70,000 level, potentially acting as a higher resistance level and extended target if momentum continues after TP1.

 2. Entry Zone: 
   - The gray shaded area near the $55,000 level represents the entry zone, with liquidity around this price. This suggests that the price may have tapped into an important liquidity pool before starting its upward movement.
   - External Liquidity: This region below the current price might have acted as a liquidity sweep, further confirming the bottoming pattern.

 3. Fair Value Gap (FVG): 
   - The chart identifies a FVG (Fair Value Gap) around the $56,000 level, which could act as an area of interest. Price has filled this gap, possibly signaling the completion of its downward move.

 4. Market Structure: 
   - The market appears to have tested lower liquidity levels and rejected them, potentially signaling that a local bottom has been established. The price action shows consolidation in the entry area, indicating accumulation before a potential upward move.

This trade idea would be well-suited for traders anticipating a medium-term bounce after Bitcoin‚Äôs recent downward movement.

CRYPTOCAP:BTC  1D chart;

Let's do a general #Bitcoin analysis;

Bitcoin hasn't had a daily EMA (50-200) crossover in a little over 11 months. However, if it continues like this, it will experience a Dead Cross cross in a few days. This can also be interpreted as a bearish signal. This intersection does not mean that it will fall 100%, but it is one of the strong signals.

Bitcoin continues its downtrend after its historic peak, making continuous lower highs.

I would like to draw your attention to the MSS levels; they signal a trend reversal. The last upward trend reversal happened and it hasn't changed to the downside yet. For this to happen, a close below the +OB level of $56000 is required. Then the downside MSS will take place. Following this closely will give you an idea of the possible trend direction.

It last tested the $49000 level with a hard pin. This is the OB resistance. We see that this area is working well.

I still think that the $48000 level, which I have mentioned every time (unless there is no contrary data), can be retested.

However, if there is a close below it, the OB at $42000 and the BPR (Balance Price Range) at $41000, just below it, could be tested.

These are not possibilities that I expect, I just want to let you know that these levels exist. In a possible dire scenario, these levels can be targeted to determine entry points.

A slow Thursday and potential leverage in the chart. Non-farm and other news is up today. Price is moving a bit slow and I don't have a a confident idea on the direction. A guess would be a fake move up to take shorts and inspire longs then back into my green zone for the lower projected areas. Dow has been rising consistently and a retrace would be understandable and DXY has been falling and is due for a bounce which could mean down for BTC but in this climate it may very well mean up for an extended false move up for a later correction probably early in the weekend while the banks are closed. Well thats it for now, hopefully a direction is revealed soon...

Hi guys, this is my overview for BTCUSDT, feel free to check it and write your feedback in commentsüëä

Recently price entered to rising channel, where it rose until to resistance line, breaking $64400 level.

Next, price turned around and made downward impulse to $49000 points, breaking two levels and exiting from rising channel.

After this, price started to trades inside pennant, where it at once bounced up from support line.

Price broke $55300 level and later rose to resistance line of pennant, which coincided with resistance level.

But a not long time ago BTC bounced and fell to support line, where at the moment continues to trades near.

Now, I think price can bounce from this line to $61600, exiting from pennant pattern.

The current market setup can be described as 'Waiting for Godot'. But in contrast to the Samuel Beckett play, markets are awaiting the Federal Reserve to finally start cutting interest rates. And hopefully, also unlike in the actual play, the wait will not be eternal.

Over the past week, market sentiment dropped even further. Jitters about the slowing US economy and rumours, later denied by the company, of a subpoena by the Department of Justice issued to AI stock darling Nvidia over antitrust matter led traditional markets downwards. Crypto markets quickly followed suit. Bitcoin has foreshadowed the slow slide downwards of the wider crypto market.

Ever since Bitcoin lost its parabolic momentum earlier in the year, it has trended down, first towards the $60k support. Once Bitcoin breached through the $60k level, and in the absence of any new positive momentum, we are now looking at the $50k price mark. Optimism right now is hard to come by for most traders.

The upcoming US jobs report for August has created further expectations of possible doom and gloom. Economists expect that the August jobs report will show that the labor market is cooling, but not dramatically. Consensus estimates are for a net gain of 160,000 jobs, which would be an increase over July‚Äôs estimated 114,000 gain according to FactSet estimates.

The outcome of the August jobs report will be an important driver for the extent to which the Federal Reserve will cut rates. The decision is both critical and difficult. Cut rates too much and markets could start raising inflation expectations. Do not cut them enough and the economy could weaken further as businesses reel from high rates on their debt. Whatever they do, the impact of lower rates will take time to show effects. In the meantime, markets can continue to struggle.

A final unknown variable in this setup are the upcoming US elections. It is likely that weaker economic performance will hurt the chances of the incumbent administration. Crypto markets clearly favour a Trump presidency due to his recently discovered pro-crypto stance. Not even the best analysts can predict the full extent of the the 2nd and 3rd order impacts of a weakening economy, possible rate cuts and a US election that is on knife's edge. Markets hate uncertainty. Unfortunately there seems to be plenty more of it to come before traders can finally start to look upwards once more.
___
Bitcoin is looking good in a smaller timeframe as well, where the price is still dropping after our recent rejection from the zone of EMAs. 

We are now waiting for sudden drop to happen which would seperate the EMAs and market price for some time (which would give a possibility for a correction to stabilise the EMAs).

Hello, this is full-time investor full_time_trader88.

Here‚Äôs a Bitcoin update for September 6.

Let‚Äôs dive right in without further delay.




 (Trendline Perspective)

‚ö´Ô∏è Downtrend Line 

On the Bitcoin chart, we have a well-defined downtrend line that has been touched five times.

Typically, trendlines break after three or four touches, so seeing a 5th touch is relatively rare. 
This indicates that the trendline is well-established and has acted as a reliable resistance each time it was tested.

Therefore, whether or not Bitcoin breaks through this trendline will be a crucial development.





 (Horizontal Perspective)

‚ö´Ô∏è Resistance Level: $57,247 

There has been persistent resistance at this level.

When viewed broadly, it's a 3-touch resistance, but if we zoom in, it becomes more like 7 touches,

making this level extremely important in the short term.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Support Zone: $55,422‚Äì$55,620 

This range has consistently acted as support.

At this point, we can see that Bitcoin is locked in a battle between this key resistance level and the underlying support zone.





Here‚Äôs a look at the combined picture, taking into account both the trendline and horizontal levels.






 (Divergence Perspective)

üîµ Accumulating Divergence 

On the 4-hour Bitcoin chart, we can see a buildup of bullish divergence.

Although divergence has been accumulating steadily, I believe it hasn't fully played out yet.

This suggests Bitcoin may be gathering strength for a potential move higher.

(In the worst case, it may never trigger. Divergences don‚Äôt always result in immediate action just because they‚Äôve formed.)





 (Daily Chart Perspective)

üî¥ Daily Bollinger Bands 

For the past 10 days, Bitcoin has struggled to break above the midline of the daily Bollinger Bands. 

It has tested this level around four times but has consistently faced strong resistance.

Ideally, we‚Äôd like to see the current bullish divergence give Bitcoin the momentum to break above the midline of the Bollinger Bands.





 (Channel Perspective)

üü† Downward Channel 

Bitcoin has been trading within a downward channel for the last 8 days, with a gradual decline.

While this slow downward movement has occurred, bullish divergence has been steadily accumulating, as mentioned earlier.

Currently, Bitcoin is holding at the lower boundary of the channel.

I personally expect an upward move from here soon (Though this is just my own analysis).





 (Fibonacci Perspective)

üü¢ Fibonacci 0.618 Level (54.5K) 

This is the Fibonacci retracement level connecting the August low and August high.

The key 0.618 level points to 54.5K.

However, 54.5K is not just an important level from a Fibonacci perspective. It‚Äôs also the exact point where the large bullish candle formed in early August.

Therefore, in my analysis, the 54.5K level is highly significant.

As long as 54.5K holds above this level, I will maintain my bullish outlook.




 Conclusion (3-Point Summary): 

1. Bullish divergence is steadily accumulating on the 4-hour Bitcoin chart.

2. The 54.5K level remains critical in my analysis.

3. As long as 54.5K holds, I will maintain a bullish perspective.


This is a simple summary of my thoughts.

Please remember, this is not financial advice, just my personal analysis for your reference.

If you found this helpful, please consider liking and subscribing.

Thank you!

(Since I trade Bitcoin full-time, I‚Äôll try to post updates frequently whenever possible.)

Current Analysis: BTC/USDT is trading within a descending channel on the 2-hour chart, suggesting that Bitcoin is in a short-term downtrend. However, BTC is currently testing the lower boundary of the channel and is showing signs of a potential bounce.

 The lower boundary of the channel is around $56,200 - $56,500.
The upper boundary of the channel near $58,500 - A breakout above this could confirm a bullish reversal.

Monitor for an increase in volume, which could signal the strength of the move if BTC attempts to break out of the channel.
RSI: Currently in a neutral zone, suggesting no immediate overbought or oversold conditions.

 A breakout above $58,500 with strong volume could trigger a move towards the next resistance levels around $60,000 and beyond.
Continued Downtrend: If BTC fails to break out and loses the $56,200 support level, it could continue to trend lower within the channel, targeting $55,000 or even lower.
Trading Plan:

Consider entering a long position on a confirmed breakout above the channel with a target of $60,000 and a stop loss just below the breakout level.
If BTC fails to hold the lower boundary and breaks below $56,200, consider shorting with a target of $55,000 and a stop loss above $57,000.

 This is not financial advice. Keep a close watch on BTC's price action for rapid changes, and adjust your strategy as necessary. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you!

___
Strong weekly support at $56,000-$54,927 has been respected on several occasions. This suggests accumulation of buyers in that area and the possibility of a bullish rebound. Recent candles indicate a double bottom and little selling pressure, reinforcing the idea of a potential rise towards $58,000 or higher. However, if the support is broken, the price could look for lower levels around $52,000.

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Please click "Boost" as well.

Have a nice day today.

-------------------------------------


The key is whether it can rise after receiving support around 56150.01-56950.56.

Even if it doesn't rise, if it doesn't fall below the short-term downtrend line, I think it has a chance of rising.

If it falls below 56150.01,
1st: 52137.67
2nd: M-Signal on the 1M chart
You should check for support around the 1st and 2nd above.


Due to the rise of USDC, the trend of the coin market is moving in line with the stock market.

I think the launch of ETF products is affecting the coin market.


Looking at the Nasdaq 100 futures chart, the key is whether it can be supported near the important section of 1.902 (18788.2) ~ 0.786 (18898.9).

If it is not supported in this section,
1st: 18250.3
2nd: 17854.8
We need to check whether there is support near the 1st and 2nd sections above.


If the decline continues, it is expected to ultimately fall to around 16000-17000.

I think the launch of ETF products has laid the foundation for the coin market to transform into a sound investment market.

However, I think that this has led to irregular effects on the coin market, which had been reflecting the flow of indicators well.


The BW indicator touched the 0 point on the BTCUSDT chart.

And, with this decline, it was about to change to the state of StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, but it has changed back to the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA.

Because of this, there is a possibility of movement after June 18, so caution is required when trading.

The next volatility period is around September 13, so if it moves sideways around 56K before that, it is judged that there is a possibility of a trend reversal.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after rising above 29K.

The section expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23

5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

Since I think it can create a new trend in the overshooting section, I need to check the movement when this section is touched.

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to create a pull back pattern and start after rising to around 57014.33.

As I have been mentioning that we are in a big reaccumulating phase for the bears.
I look at charts that has similar pattern playing out and what I see is when we have the covid crash in 2020 before making new all time high. I am using that but reversed for the bears.

Based on the chart, we will expect to see one last pump to liquidate the shorts before making the biggest leg down. target price for the pump can varies from 68000-72000 - liquidate area.

You would see a very sharp pump and it will be in the overbought area, once we reached the overbought area in the rsi and macd, and momentum shifts, that is your sign to get out as we will be coming back down for the finish the reaccumulating pattern to create the bear market past 49000.

Looks like BTC is attempting a reversal from a Double Bottom pattern on the 2-hour chart. The price has formed two significant bottoms around the $55,000 mark, and we‚Äôre now seeing an early breakout above the descending trendline. If this pattern holds, the target is around $62,000. The RSI is hovering in the neutral zone, suggesting there's room for upward momentum, while the MACD is starting to turn bullish, signaling potential buy pressure building up. Watch out for any pullbacks that hold above $55,000 for confirmation.
___
There is a possibility of the asset continuing to decline until it reaches the discount zone of the order block. After that, I anticipate a strong markup.
___
A drop from the 50 after a few 15 minute candles didn't really do much would have been a good entry. About a 1.8% drop. I was correct about this 57,200. I had finally had a chance to review some higher time frames and that proved effective. MM can go either way here but dont be surprised if the lower green areas are taken as there may be high liquidity there...

If Price respect my Marked zone, Then we'll expect clear direction to upwards.

In the weekly chart, the XRP price action reveals a triangle pattern formation. With a solid support trendline, the recent bull cycle within the pattern challenges the overhead trendline. 

Currently, it is taking support at the confluence of the 50-week and 200-week EMA in a sideways trend in a bullish alignment. Furthermore, the XRP price struggles to surpass the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.5993 in the weekly chart. 

Facing multiple higher price rejections, the weekly closing above this level is yet to be achieved. Last week, the XRP price dropped 8.76% and is currently trading at $0.5542 with a weekly return of 1.19%. 

In the recent turn of events, the attorney Fred Rispolli has downplayed the recent concerns of the SEC appealing the XRP ruling. As per his point of view, the ruling is unlikely until 2026, which will have little to no impact on the XRP price. 

Hence, the upcoming XRP prices will likely be independent and not depend on the ongoing lawsuit. Meanwhile, Ripple has requested a stay order on the $125 million penalty announced in the recent events.

Further, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has announced the upcoming release of Ripple USD stablecoin and the active efforts to boost the XRPL ecosystem with smart contract capabilities in the Ripple blockchain. 

Despite the recent key developments, the XRP price has not found any positive impact and continues to follow a sideways trend after the bearish impact. 

The ongoing bear market remains a key reason behind the need for the bullish impact of such major developments. Hence, with a broader market recovery anticipated by late 2024, the bull run in XRP will likely surpass the 23.60% level. 

Based on the Fibonacci levels, the price targets 2026 stand at $1.29 and $1.56.

üîªüîªFor the price to continue its decline towards the first target (50096.10-52489.40), the daily candle must close below 55606.00‚úÖ

‚ÄºÔ∏èTarget 1 aligns well with the bottom of the weekly bearish channel, and there is potential for a bearish divergence confirmation at this support zone if the price declines.

üôÖTherefore, we consider Target 1 as the maximum drop potential. There is a high probability of a bottom forming and an bull-trend starting from this area‚úÖüöÄ

üîªüîªüîªHowever, if the divergence is negated, meaning the MACD forms a lower low, Bitcoin could continue its decline towards Target 2 (41218.20)üòê

üìä#BTC Bullish Head and Shoulders Structure‚ùì

üß†From a structural perspective, we encountered obstacles after completing the goal of the long structure. Yesterday we also emphasized the strong resistance near 58250. Today we saw the opportunity to build a bearish double top structure near the selling zone and entered a short trade. At present, the goals of this structure have been fully achieved and the short order has been closed. If you opened a short position near strong resistance yesterday, you should reduce or close your position now.

‚û°Ô∏èCurrently we are in a position where the support zone and the buy zone overlap, which is considered the heaviest support zone. If we rebound from here and can break through the inflection point of 58500, then we have the opportunity to build a bullish head and shoulders structure. If this The structure holds, then we may be able to reverse the downward trend.

üü¢ September 5, 2024, 06:00 AM - Buy Date (Green Line):
This is a potential local low, indicating that it may be a favorable time to start accumulating long positions in BTC as the price is expected to drop leading up to this point.

üü• September 6, 2024, 07:00 PM - Sell Date (Red Line):
This date represents a local peak, suggesting an optimal moment to take profits or tighten stop-losses, as a price correction is likely to follow.

üü¢ September 7, 2024, 06:00 PM - Buy Date (Green Line):
Another opportunity for long positions as a local bottom is anticipated around this time, potentially providing favorable entry conditions for buying Bitcoin.

üïí Note: All times are based on Los Angeles time (UTC -7). A margin of error of 1-2 candles may exist depending on the timeframe. Always cross-check this analysis with higher timeframes for a more comprehensive view.

The past few week has been a slow bleed for majority of Altcoins and that's majorly due to the slow trend of BTC. 

BTC has developed a channel range over the past 15 weeks which has now developed into a visible pattern. 
The biggest narrative for me now is patience cause there's been a load of "what if" questions. 
It's important to note that the 45k - 48k region is pivotal to the continuation of the Up trend.

On my chart, i've been able to clearly identify the range lows, high and mid range respectively as this could be very useful in the coming weeks. 

With this said, i'd be patient to see how the market responds this regions.

Stay safe, Traders

gm,

as we continue to consolidate and fear begins to rise, it becomes blatantly clear to me as to what is truly going on.

we're clearly in a fourth wave.
fourth waves are notorious for creating fear, uncertainty, and doubt. they make you question weather the trend is truly over, they bore you with sideways price action which makes you hand over your hard earned coin to the one who is re-accumulating, in preparation for the next mark-up phase.

the person who is accumulating will buy everything you have to sell, 1:1. not a penny more.
whenever you run out of coin to sell, the accumulator will begin the mark-up phase, and you will likely begin to fomo back into the market after awhile, which will cause an aggressive \ parabolic push up.

this is a time for accumulation,
not for capitulation.

A great deal of viewers have contacted me asking how I "time" the market. In other words, once I've identified a market as "set up" (via COT strategy or Valuation Strategy), how do I get into a trade.

This video is the first in a series that will outline the entry techniques that I use.
 
18 PERIOD MOVING AVERAGE ENTRY METHOD: 

By far, this method is the safest change of trend confirmation that you will find. There are other entry techniques that will get you into the market sooner, sure. But those other entry techniques come with greater risk, and could be called "bottom picking" to some degree. 

The 18 Period MA Entry Method is simple.

 STEP 1:  Plot the 18 period SMA on your chart based on the closing price.

 STEP 2:  For  LONGS , you need to see two full range candles form  ABOVE  the MA. From there, mark out the highest high of those 2 candles. When price trades up into that high, the trend has officially changed to bullish. For  SHORTS , you need to see to full range candles form  BELOW  the MA. From there, mark out the lowest low of those 2 candles. When price trades down into that low, the trend has officially changed to bearish. 

 CAVEAT:  We  do not count inside bars  (bars that form within the range of the previous candle). If you see inside bars, skip them and continue your 2 bar count.

 STEP 3:  Enter at market when high/low is breached. Risk management is something I will review in another video, but generally, I add/subtract 120%-150% of the 3 bar ATR.

 CLARIFICATION:  To be clear, this entry technique should not be traded blindly.  You need to have a REASON to take the trade  (for example, COT strategy suggests a market is setup for a trade, or the Valuation/Ducks in a Barrel setup suggests a market is setup for a trade). 

 CREDIT:  I credit Larry Williams, Tom DeMark, Brian Schad & Jake Bernstein for their influence in these ideas.

If you have any questions about this entry technique, feel free to shoot me a message.

Good Luck & Good Trading.

BTC is in a tight consolidation range, and the next move could be decisive in the very short term. Keep an eye on key support and resistance levels and watch for volume spikes to confirm the breakout direction. As always, manage risk with appropriate stop-loss levels.

This is a quick update for immediate trading decisions, so be sure to monitor closely for any rapid changes in price action.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.

On the above 10 day chart a bull flag is identified. In addition RSI has recently confirmed the 52 level as support. This is an important indication on this timeframe, look left.

When does 128k strike? Don‚Äôt know. No one does. However it happens before June 2025 or not at all. When it happens, that is the market top. Exit all crypto positions by this time.

Is it possible price action continues downtrend? Sure.
Is it probable? No.

Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Observing the chart, we can see that the price entered an upward channel, where it in a short time rose to the resistance level, which coincided with the seller zone, broke it, and continued to move up. But later it made a correction to the 64500 level, after which made an upward movement and then made a strong impulse down, thereby exiting from the channel and breaking the 64500 and 55700 levels. Also then, the price started to trades inside the wedge, where it at once turned around from the support line and rebounded higher than the 55700 level, which coincided with the buyer zone, breaking this level again. Next, the price made a retest and continued to rise to the resistance level, and when it reached it, BTC turned around and dropped to the support level. But a not long time ago it started to move up and I think that Bitcoin can rebound from the support line and start to grow to the resistance line of the wedge. For this case, I set my TP at 62100 points, which coincides with the resistance line. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ
___
Bitcoin remains at support, testing this level precisely today. Yesterday‚Äôs candle dipped below support with a long wick but closed above it, forming a potentially bullish candle. However, this type of candle needs confirmation, which would mean another bullish candle today. At the moment, we don't have that.

Once again, Bitcoin is sitting at support, and the bullish divergence on multiple time frames is still valid. For now, nothing has changed since yesterday, but we want to see some buying action today.

More importantly, this only matters if you are trading daily. For those dollar-cost averaging or holding long-term positions, this short-term analysis shouldn‚Äôt matter. I assume this applies to 99.9% of you.

Ive charted the longer time frames and think I may have found the zones. Further down will take current longs and instigate the opening of shorts where I think the mm will come back up and close those shorts 53 618 is a key level and i wouldnt be surprised if you get a direct hit on it today before moving back up.

# Bitcoin Update on Thursday, 05.09.2024

Assalamu Alaikum and good morning to all brothers and sisters!

# Bitcoin continues to drop, as I mentioned in yesterday's analysis. In this chart, I have drawn the exact reversal points by price (see arrows #6, #5, #4). Once again, the price is typically in a downtrend/range. However, a catalyst can reverse the trend. Otherwise, the price may continue in the same direction.

# ALTS
# Altcoins are dropping as usual, more than Bitcoin. At the moment, there are no buy trades. We can look for sell trades later. I will share some sell trades in the group later, Insha'Allah.

I wish you all a very nice day.

Yesterday for  Bitcoin , we saw a bounce from $56,000 and tested the selling zone of $58,000-$59,400 (mirrored volume zone), from which we expected a selling reaction.
At the moment, we have returned to the local buying zone of $56,700-$56,000, from which a repeated buyer reaction and a test of higher levels is likely.

So far, this is not a full-fledged rebound, and the indicated situation should only be traded intraday. In the medium term, we still haven't broken the downward trend, so we're waiting for the resolution.

 Buying zones:  $56,700-$56,000 (volume zone), $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies), level $48,000.

 Selling zones:  level: $58,700-$59,400 (mirrored volume zone, with offset), $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes).

 Interesting altcoins.

CHZUSDT 

For this coin, we broke the descending trendline and formed an interesting volume zone of $0.0495-$0.0485, from which, if there's a reaction, we open a long position with the first target of ~$0.054.
The second trading option is a false breakout of the local low at $0.0478
___
Technical Analysis: 

 1. Key Support and Resistance Levels: 
 
 The price is approaching a key support zone at $55,000, which has acted as a crucial level in previous bounces. A hold at this level could signal a potential bullish reversal.
 On the other hand, the $65,000 resistance level serves as the next critical barrier for the price to break. A confirmed breakout above this zone could open the door for a stronger bullish continuation.
 

 2. Price Action and Consolidation: 
 
 The current price action shows that the price is consolidating near the bottom of a defined channel, which has historically acted as a zone of strong support.
 If the price remains above $55,000, it could signal that liquidity at previous lows has been taken, clearing the path for a bullish push towards the $65,000 level.
 

 3. Momentum Indicators: 
 
 The momentum indicator shows signs of a previous bullish regular divergence, suggesting that although momentum has decreased recently, a bounce from the $55,000 support could reignite bullish momentum.
 There is also a prior crossover around the zero line, indicating that momentum could shift back in favor of the bulls if the price stabilizes and rises from current levels.
 

 4. Bullish Scenario: 
 
 The bullish scenario depends on price maintaining above $55,000. If the price bounces from this support and gains enough momentum to break through $65,000, we could see a stronger bullish continuation toward higher levels.
 It's important to wait for confirmation of the breakout above $65,000 before entering long positions, as this would solidify the bullish reversal.
 

 5. Conclusion: 
 
 BTC/USDT is in a critical position, with the $55,000 support level playing a key role in determining the next move. If the price holds and rebounds, the bullish scenario becomes more likely, with $65,000 as the next resistance target.
 Traders should closely monitor the support zone and look for potential confirmation before taking positions. A break below $55,000 could invalidate the bullish setup, requiring a reassessment.

___
Technical Analysis: 

 1. Price Rebound and Market Structure: 
 
 The price action shows a clear bullish rebound within a significant demand zone, aligning with the 61.8% - 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels of the previous bullish impulse. This area has historically acted as a strong support, and the current price movement suggests a potential continuation to the upside.
 The overall market structure remains bullish, as confirmed by the recent break of structure (BOS), indicating that buyers are still in control of the trend.
 

 2. Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs): 
 
 The EMAs are aligned favorably for a bullish continuation, acting as dynamic support for the price. The price has consistently bounced from these EMAs, suggesting that they remain critical for the continuation of the uptrend.
 As long as the price holds above the EMAs, the bullish structure remains intact, and the trend is likely to extend further.
 

 3. Momentum and Hidden Bullish Divergence: 
 
 A hidden bullish divergence is evident on the momentum indicator, indicating that while momentum has decreased slightly, price action remains strong. This suggests a continuation signal despite the temporary slowdown in momentum.
 Additionally, there is a potential bullish crossover forming, which could act as another signal for upward movement. This confluence of signals points towards further gains in the near term.
 

 4. Key Levels and Fibonacci Zones: 
 
 The Fibonacci retracement zones (61.8% and 78.6%) are crucial levels where price has found support. As long as these levels hold, the probability of a move towards new highs increases.
 Potential upside targets include previous resistance levels near $85,000 and further towards $92,000 if the bullish scenario plays out.
 

 5. Conclusion: 
 
 With strong support from EMAs, bullish market structure, and key Fibonacci levels acting as support, the outlook for BTC/USDT remains bullish. Momentum indicators also suggest that this trend is likely to continue.
 Traders should keep an eye on potential breakouts from resistance levels, with possible targets at $85,000 and $92,000. However, should the price fall below the current support levels, a reevaluation of the trend would be necessary.

Hello, this is Chartist.

Let‚Äôs briefly analyze the Bitcoin chart.

I am considering the possibility of a 'rebound' and will provide two reasons to support this view.


First, let's look at the 4-hour chart.



Last month, Bitcoin dropped to 49K and quickly rebounded. 

Although there was a price correction afterward, the yellow candles acted as crucial support for another upward move.

Notably, when Bitcoin dropped on the 4th of last month, we can see it also received support at the same level.

This suggests that the yellow supply zone remains a valid support area, and as long as this support holds, a rebound is likely.


Next, let‚Äôs look at the 15-minute chart.



Bitcoin is currently moving within a specific channel, with price action forming around the middle and top of the channel.

Although there was a brief break below the channel with a red candle, if this pattern turns out to be a bear trap,
there is a strong chance of a rebound back to the middle or top of the channel.

A bear trap occurs when the market appears to be dropping but actually reverses to the upside, misleading traders.

Therefore, holding the bottom of the channel is critical, and if this fails, we need to be cautious of further declines.


< Summary >

- Reason for rebound 1 : Valid support from the yellow supply zone on the 4-hour chart.

- Reason for rebound 2 : Movement within the channel on the 15-minute chart and the possibility of a "Bear Trap".

- Caution : If the bottom of the channel fails to support, be wary of additional declines.

‚Äª This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
‚Äª It is a personal perspective and should be used for reference only.
‚Äª All decisions and responsibilities are yours.

Bitcoin was rejected from the $58k level yesterday. Right now, I could see a move higher, but until the trend has changed, we will continue to make lower lows. One level to keep an eye on is still the low at $54.5k.
___
On a smaller timeframe, we see that while price is seeing some struggle to secure fully the zone, we are still below major EMAs and price is seeing pressure from sellers, which can be seen clearly here with that re-test that rejected the buyers.

We are looking for the price to secure that zone by tomorrow, if not today so keep an eye on it; once we see it, we should be good for downward movement.

BINANCE:BTCUSD  is not falling below 50K, which is expected by many. The flagship continues to consolidate ( which has been going on for half a year now ) and accumulate potential at the expense of some traders or another, mostly at the expense of sellers. Why am I being positive? 

  .

In the second half of August, BTC tried to move into the realization phase and headed towards 70K, but ran into a block of limit orders ( resistance ) at 65K - MM is not ready to let the price go. Having formed a double top, the price returns to the range confirming the fact of false breakdown and liquidation, as a consequence of such actions MM has an interest - liquidity from below ( for this reason I am waiting for initial decline with subsequent growth ). The chart above shows the key zones and possible scenarios to pay attention to when forming your strategy

There is no constructive reason for the formed fall and therefore this movement can be considered purely manipulative, the purpose of which may be to buy up the asset through panic selling as well as prolonged accumulation before realization. 

 Resistance levels: 59600, 60500
Support levels: 58700, 57900, 57736, 56078 

  .

The market is still strong but in a range. Any attempts to sell-off are aggressively bought out by whales ( liquidity withdrawal ). On W1-M1 a stop is forming after a strong rally, which is considered as a controlled consolidation within the bull cycle, which is far from ending. The high probability scenario of that technical nuance is an upward distribution of accumulation. 

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:BTCUSD   ;)

Welcome back future demons

Let's jump right into the TA. 

We have a potential short trade here. This might not qualify as the perfect example of a Head and Shoulder formation in Classical Charting, but the over all structure and pattern is bearish.

Also yesterday we saw a significant drop combined with huge volume increase.

Greetings, everyone.üòâ

I would like to present a scenario for your consideration, grounded in  "Elliott Wave Theory" .

 

 ‚úîÔ∏è Wave initiated from the 15K level: Classified as a "Double Zigzag"
‚úîÔ∏è Current wave in development: Y-c-3
‚úîÔ∏è Projected upward range: 93K ~ 101K 

The rationale behind this analysis is as follows:

 
 Zigzag patterns typically move within a parallel channel.
 The first zigzag wave, which started from the 15K level, adhered precisely to this parallel channel.
 As a result, the likelihood of a complex correction occurring is considerably high.
 

Based on these observations, I have constructed this particular scenario. It is an illustrative representation of potential market behavior, grounded in established technical principles. Wishing you all the best of luck.

 
 This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
 It is a personal perspective and should be used for reference only.
 All decisions and responsibilities lie with you.
___
Overall, a Short update of the analysis implies a cautiously optimistic outlook with a focus on the $52,408 support level as a crucial point. If Bitcoin can maintain above this level, a bounce towards higher levels within the descending channel is anticipated, with a potential test of the upper resistance line around $70,000. However, if this support fails, further downside pressure could ensue.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.

BTC may decline back to $49,950, however this is likely WORST CASE SCENARIO and should be aggressively bought. Actual invalidation of bull market at 38500--however reaching this price is very unlikely.

 Full target of Bull Flag: 110K!! 
See for more information on bull flags-- not all of them reach their price targets! : www.thepatternsite.com

Price in potential Local Trading range--unconfirmed on bottom, must break above small white line at current price for confirmation of trading range. Until then, expect gradual declines potentially to 49,950. Once small white line broken, longs until top of the trading range can be taken.

The whales trading bots and algorithms have been updated again and this time the feature has been set to "sideways." This is the best possible scenario for the Cryptocurrency market as a whole.

‚ûñ If Bitcoin crashes too strongly, too fast, the Altcoins cannot recover.
‚ûñ If the Altcoins cannot recover, the market can die because it has been red for too long.

‚ûñ If Bitcoin moves up and rises too fast, the neglected Altcoins section of the market cannot grow because Bitcoin would suck all of the energy.

‚û¢ When Bitcoin is sideways at a high price, the entire Altcoins market can shine.

The Altcoins we've been looking at produced a major low followed by the initial bullish breakout. After this initial bullish breakout, ALL, produced a higher low and are now resuming their bullish action.

Imagine, if Bitcoin crashed today, instead of a higher low and the resumption of the bullish move everything would crash together with it. Instead, if Bitcoin stalls and goes sideways, say for 10-14 days, the Altcoins can produce a huge bullish wave. We are talking between 100% and 300% growth in such a short-period of time.

This is enough for energy to reach all sectors of the market... After this phase whatever needs to happen will happen and then the market will continue with its major flush before the next full blown bull-market.

There is a second benefit for the market owners. When everybody's attention goes to the Altcoins, they will forget about the capitulation event, and this will make it 1,000 times easier for the surprise, unexpected, highly predictable, 6 months in the making crash to take place.

Nothing changes... We buy and hold focusing on the long-term.

It doesn't matter how far down it goes;
It doesn't matter how long the recovery after the crash will take;
We are in the accumulation phase and we focus on the Altcoins for massive gains.

Knowing that there will be a recovery after the fall, we can just look at those that already hit bottom and buy them up.

When Bitcoin completes is bearish cycle, we can catch the bottom and with Bitcoin too go LONG!

I am always grateful for your amazing and continued support.

So I just opened a bitcoin short. I think this is a good price for an early entry.

Am anticipating a similar aggressive push down similarly to what we had yesterday around these same prices.

First potential take profit is  $56600 but am aiming for at 75% close at $55000

Full close at $54000 give trade plays out. The odds are in my favor because trade aligns with my edge ticking  enough boxes.

I'll make follow up updates in the comment.

Stop is above $58551, hopefully its enough based on my calculations.

The move should start now leading into the next few hours

On 12 September Mercury reaches the same place in the sky where He turned retrograde and caused the initial drop to 49K for bitcoin.

As I mention in my BITCOIN BTC 2024 PREDICTIONS book, on 12 September bitcoin starts climbing, due to the kendra positions of Moon and Mars; and of Sun and Jupiter respectively in the sky.

üìà  Technical analysis BTC/USDT 

The price of Bitcoin continues to fall and has remained below the EMA 200 and EMA 50 moving averages for over a week. A hidden bearish divergence is forming on the RSI indicator. If the support level at $56,000 fails to hold against selling pressure, we expect a move into the Imbalance 1H zone, where the gaps on the horizontal volume levels need to be filled through trading. In the range of $50,000 - $52,000, we anticipate the correction to conclude and the trend to reverse. Otherwise, the price may head into the next Imbalance 4H zone, where it could experience a deep freefall, potentially leading to a retest of the global upward trend line. This is due to the lack of significant resistance blocks and large gaps on the horizontal volume levels in this area.

For the price to resume its upward movement, BTC needs to break above the dynamic resistance line of the EMA 200 and secure a position above the ascending trend line. This would pave the way for a retest of the $65,000 resistance level and further movement towards the global trend line and the major resistance block at $70,000 - $75,000.

  


üìâ  Bitcoin market global analysis 

On the daily logarithmic chart, Bitcoin's price continues to move within a broadening wedge pattern. Currently, the price is approaching a retest of the 200-day moving average, and the outcome of this retest will determine its future direction. Globally, the descending wedge is considered a bullish corrective pattern. However, before breaking out upwards and resuming its growth, BTC may test the lower boundary of the wedge near the 0.61-0.78 Fibonacci retracement levels, where the global support trendline is also located. Such a scenario would present a good opportunity to accumulate long-term positions before the final rally of this Bitcoin cycle.

Above the current ATH, there are no resistance levels based on historical data. Therefore, to set growth targets, we will use trendlines, Fibonacci extension levels, and an analysis of large order blocks in order books. The first 1.23 Fibonacci extension level is located at $80,000. In the $90,000 - $100,000 range, there is a global trendline built on the peaks of the two previous Bitcoin cycles, along with the 1.38 Fibonacci extension level. The highest trendline is in the range of the 1.61 - 1.78 Fibonacci extension levels, with its test potentially starting at the $100,000 level.

  


üí†  Analysis of liquidity zones and levels 

The Fear and Greed Index is in the fear zone - 27.
The total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market fell to $1993 billion, and the Bitcoin Dominance Index rose to 57.54.
According to the analysis of the accumulation of large order blocks in the order books, the largest blocks are at levels 50,000 and 70,000, and the supply and demand zones are located at the following levels:
üü¢ Demand zone: 50,000 - 56,000
üî¥ Supply zone: 68,000 - 80,000

Levels for long positions:
55,000 - large support block
52,000 - large support block
50,000 - psychological support level

Levels for short positions:
60,000 - EMA 200 retest
65,000 - large resistance block
70,000 - large resistance block
80,000 - large resistance block

  


üìä  Fundamental analysis 

In September, the cryptocurrency market is facing significant uncertainty. There has been a continued outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Last week alone, $305 million was withdrawn from cryptocurrency-based investment products, and on the last trading day, ETFs collectively lost $287.7 million, marking the third-largest daily outflow.

Bitcoin historically tends to decline in September, with BTC consistently showing negative performance during this month. Since 2013, its price has dropped by an average of 4.78% in September. Analysts have also noted a decrease in stablecoin inflows, indicating that market participants are expecting further price declines. However, if history repeats itself, BTC could see significant growth starting in October, as large players are already increasing their positions and withdrawing Bitcoin from exchanges.

Major Wall Street indices ended Tuesday's trading session with losses, driven by negative trends in the technology, commodities, and oil and gas sectors. Looking ahead, the U.S. economic calendar is packed with important events, including the upcoming presidential elections. Experts predict that cryptocurrencies will become increasingly sensitive to developments surrounding potential changes in U.S. monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is set to make a decision on the key interest rate on September 18. Previously, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated a likely reduction in the key interest rate, boosting investor optimism.

üåê Upcoming Events in the Global Economy

We expect increased volatility in both stock and cryptocurrency markets on the following dates:

‚û§ 09/06, 15:30 - US unemployment data for August.

‚û§ 09/11, 15:30 - US consumer inflation index (CPI) for August.

‚û§ 09/18, 21:00 - New Fed interest rate decision.

‚û§ 11/05, 00:00 - US presidential election.

‚û§ 11/07, 21:00 - New Fed interest rate decision.


üìà  Statistics of signals from our AI trading indicator: 

In August, the Bitcoin price continued falling, and then the market began to slowly recover. Our trading indicator, as always, warned about this in advance! And even during the flat period it gave good entry points. Thanks to the latest updates, all 11 signals have become profitable, and built-in Anti-Flat System prevented losses from manipulative market movements.
- Total price movement by all signals: + 70.73%
- Maximum price movement: + 22.81%
- Average price movement: + 6.43%

Just what I would like to see not what will happen
___
1. Market Structure:
   - MSS (Market Structure Shift): The chart indicates a shift in market structure (MSS) at the marked point. This typically indicates a potential change in the market's direction, possibly from bearish to bullish or vice versa.

2. Liquidity Zones:
   - Liquidity: There is a horizontal line labeled "Liquidity" at a higher price level. This suggests that the trader is eyeing a potential price movement towards this area where liquidity might be resting, which could be targeted by large market players.
   - Ext. Liquidity (External Liquidity): The area at the bottom (marked as "Ext. Liquidity") could represent an area of interest where sell-side liquidity might be present. This is possibly a support zone where the price may reverse after liquidity is taken.

3. Entry Zone:
   - The chart highlights a gray shaded area (just above the external liquidity) as an "Entry" zone. This is where the trader plans to enter a long position, expecting the price to rise from this support level.

4. Target Zone:
   - Take Profit (TP) Level: The target zone is marked with a blue rectangle, stretching to the liquidity level. This area indicates where the trader expects to exit the trade, anticipating that the price will reach this higher level of liquidity.

5. Risk-Reward Consideration:
   - The trade setup suggests a favorable risk-to-reward ratio, as the entry is near a support level with the expectation of a significant price movement toward the upper liquidity area.

6. Time Frame and Context:
   - The 4-hour time frame suggests this is a medium-term trade, potentially taking a few days to play out. The context of the larger downtrend (visible on the left side of the chart) implies that the trader might be looking for a corrective move upward or a reversal after a significant downtrend.

Hello, Guysüòâ

Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive right into the main content.

-

In short, I believe Bitcoin is positioned for a price increase.

I‚Äôll explain this outlook through three key arguments,

starting with the first one.

-

‚úÖ  Reason 1.   

I‚Äôve applied the Bollinger Bands to Bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart.

Currently, the price is rebounding after touching the lower band.

Support and resistance often occur at the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands.

In this case, the price first hit the upper band, followed by a touch of the lower band‚Äîtypically a precursor to a rebound.

Let‚Äôs verify this with some historical examples.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

This is the chart from January 2024.

At that time, the price followed a similar pattern, first hitting the upper band, then touching the lower band.

Following this, the price rebounded sharply and eventually hit a new "All-time high".


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, take a look at this chart from February 2023.

Once again, the price touched the upper band, followed by the lower band, and we saw four consecutive green candles afterward, leading to a significant rally.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 3. 

This is the chart from February 2022.

Despite a prevailing downtrend, we witnessed a technical bounce after the price touched the upper band and then dropped to the lower band.

A significant rebound followed, even in the midst of bearish market conditions.

Now, let‚Äôs shift back to the current chart.

----------

‚úÖ  Reason 2. 

Next, let's take a look at the rising channel formed by three critical points.

I find this channel quite interesting.

 When focusing on the Half Line, it has consistently provided clear support and resistance levels.

Recently, we saw the price being rejected at this channel, which further reinforces its reliability.

However, the price has currently broken below the channel.

If it manages to rebound and reenter, we could witness a significant upward movement.

This pattern is commonly referred to as a "Trap," a frequent occurrence in technical analysis.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

This is the chart from December 2023.

We had a rising channel based on three key points. 

After a sharp drop, the price broke below the channel but quickly recovered, forming a "Trap" pattern before rising to the opposite end of the channel.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, take a look at the chart from March 2024.

Once again, we see a rising channel formed by three key points.

After ten consecutive green candles, the price hit a peak and dropped.

Despite breaking below the channel, the price quickly recovered, forming another "Trap" pattern and continued to rise, holding the middle line of the channel.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 3. 

Here‚Äôs a chart from November 2023.

This rising channel was formed by connecting the lower trendline and the peak.

After a price drop, the price broke below the lower trendline, forcing many retail investors to exit their positions.

However, the price soon rebounded and eventually broke out of the channel to the upside.

This time, the "Trap" pattern appeared twice, triggering multiple exits from the market.


‚úÖ  Reason 3. 

The third reason involves the  "3 Market Phases"  pattern.

This pattern typically unfolds in three distinct stages: Contraction, Expansion, and Profit Taking.

 
 First, Contraction occurs, which stabilizes the price range and makes investors feel comfortable.
 Next, the Expansion phase kicks in, causing volatility and confusion, often leading investors to get stopped out.
 Finally, the Profit Taking phase occurs, sparking a "FOMO" (fear of missing out) sentiment among investors as the price moves rapidly.
 

This pattern is often leveraged by market manipulators to shake out retail investors before a larger price movement.

Let‚Äôs take a look at some past examples to see this in action.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

Here‚Äôs the chart from January 2024.

It showcases a textbook example of the 3 Market Phases:

Contraction stabilized the price range,
Expansion created volatility and confusion,
and Profit Taking resulted in a strong uptrend.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, here‚Äôs the chart from June 2023.

Again, we see a classic case of the 3 Market Phases pattern.

During the Expansion phase, the price breached both the upper and lower bounds, forcing retail investors to stop out. This was followed by a strong directional trend.

-

‚úÖ   

 
 First reason: Bollinger Bands
 Second reason: The Channel
 Third reason: 3 Market Phases
 

-

Now, for the final conclusion of today‚Äôs post

 I am anticipating a significant upward move. 

As long as the three reasons mentioned today remain valid, I remain confident in this bullish setup.

This is a historically high-probability scenario, and  I personally plan to take a "long position." 

Thank you for reading, and if you found this analysis helpful, please consider giving it a boost and following me for future updates.

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà BTC has been stuck in a descending channel, ranging between 50k and 70k.

As it approaches the 50k zone, we will be looking for medium-term long positions.

üèπ For a long-term trade targeting the 80k resistance, a break above the upper red trendline is required.

Which scenario do you think is more likely to happen first, and why?

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

BlackRock is nowhere to be found... And I noticed that lately Michael Saylor hasn't been buying any Bitcoins. What to make of this information?

One way to look at the Bitcoin market from a rookie bullish perspective, is through the story that Bitcoin is strong and cannot move lower because (1) the Spot ETFs (aka. BlackRock) will buy everything and (2) Michael Saylor "bought Bitcoin."

This is a true story.

Bitcoin is still trading at $57,700.

Now, what if you are one of those Spot ETFs and MS Bought Bitcoin kind of person, how are you feeling now that these people are nowhere to be found? Does this lowers your confidence in Bitcoins ability to maintain its current price, or, are we still aiming for 100K next?

The correction is on! and has been ongoing for almost six months now.  We are about to experience what traders call the final "leg down." 

It is very intriguing, I can feel the suspense in the air... But we have bearish action, lower lows and normally, when you are about to experience a very strong rise everything is green, day after day. Right now I am only seeing red.

What do you make of the current situation?
Is Bitcoin going up or down?

Prepare for the crash.

We are trading the altcoins but remember, and this is very important, at first, everything can experience a very strong negative reaction but everything soon stabilises. The smaller ones will recover sooner, some will not even flinch. Others will grow... We looked at this many times through hundreds of charts. 

The big ones, the giants, are going to crash together with Bitcoin. You already know about those.
The altcoins trading against Bitcoin, some are safe but prepare to hold strong for a few days.

The tether pairs are mixed. Each chart should be considered individually.

I am wishing you the best.

Once the correction is over, we will be sharing bullish charts, LONG, until late 2025.
It will be awesome.

I love you.
You are truly appreciated.

Thanks a lot for your amazing support.
I love life.

Namaste.

Bitcoin Market Analysis - September 4 

Greetings, this is full time trader88

Today, I will be discussing Bitcoin's market conditions with a focus on psychological analysis rather than chart-based insights.

In summary, I am leaning towards a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. The key support level I am monitoring is $54.5K. However, given that this analysis emphasizes psychological factors over technical chart details, I will refrain from in-depth chart analysis.


Psychological Analysis:

 1. Uncertainty in Support Levels 

Currently, the delineation of support levels appears ambiguous. There is significant variation among traders regarding the precise level of support. Although I have identified $54.5K as a potential support level, this does not imply it is the definitive answer. This ambiguity reflects the current disorder within the chart.


 2. Stop-Loss Triggers 

It is likely that many traders who took long positions have experienced multiple stop-loss triggers (myself included). Especially when the price was above $57K, the market dynamics were confusing, often leading to indecision between long and short positions. This difficulty, while possibly a result of my own limitations, highlights the general complexity of the current market conditions.


 3. Volume at the Lower Wick 

The lower wick formed this morning at approximately $55,555 (Binance Futures) has shown notable trading volume. Particularly, when observed on a 15-minute chart, this represents the largest trading volume since early August. This suggests significant market activity at this level, indicating potential whale interest, even if it involves smaller players.


 4. Predominant Market Sentiment 

Many traders are likely strategizing to buy around the  GETTEX:48K - GETTEX:54K  range, expecting this level to hold. There is a perception that a minor leverage position might be safe. Paradoxically, market forces may choose not to honor these levels, potentially leading to a scenario where the market moves unexpectedly. Given that a substantial number of retail traders have likely already exited their long positions, there could be a sudden upward move that catches many off guard.


 5. Revenge Trading 

Given the number of traders who have been shaken out of long positions, there is a risk of revenge trading. If the market shows even a slight upward movement, traders might seek to short the market. Market forces are likely to exploit this behavior by pushing the market higher while avoiding the long positions that were previously liquidated.


 6. Challenges in Entering Long Positions 

If a substantial upward move occurs, it may become increasingly difficult to enter long positions at desirable levels. Traders might hesitate to buy higher, preferring to wait for lower prices.


 7. Conclusion 

Based on the aforementioned points, I anticipate a heightened probability of an unexpected upward movement. Key factors include the possibility of market movements deviating from retail traders' expectations and the tendency for markets to start upward trends without accommodating retail positions.

Please note, this analysis is based on my personal perspective and is not grounded in empirical evidence. It is essential to exercise your own judgment and not rely solely on these insights.

Thank you for your attention.

The Gann fan is also constructed to understand the dynamic support/resistance areas of the trend as the price movement develops in the future. 

Remember, this is a phase of Dow Theory ‚Äî participation, i.e. majority participation. I suggest paying attention to altcoins that are not caught up in the news backdrop.

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. Not long ago, the price made impulse up to the resistance level, which coincided with the resistance zone, thereby breaking the 56700 support level. After this, the price some time tried near this level and later dropped to the 56700 level, after which it turned around and started to move up. In a short time, BTC reached the 61800 level again and even broke it, after which rose higher than the resistance zone to the trend line. Next, the price started to decline between the trend line and firstly quickly fell to the 61800 level and broke it one more time. Then price fell more, but later turned around and rose to the trend line and continued to decline near this line. At the moment, the price is trying to break this line, so, in my mind, BTCUSDT will decline below the trend line and then rebound up, breaking finally this line. For this case, I set my goal at 60500 points. If you like my analytics you may support me with your like/comment ‚ù§Ô∏è

Bitcoin (BTC) remained bearish, as the king coin was trading under $57k at press time. While this initially looked disastrous, for savvy investors, this might as well be a right opportunity to buy the dip.

According to CoinMarketCap, BTC‚Äôs price dropped by more than 3% in the last seven days. In the last 24 hours alone, the king coin witnessed a nearly 4% price fall. 

Meanwhile, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet revealing a bullish development. Top BTC traders on Binance showed a slight bullish tilt, with 51.79% investors holding long positions on BTC. 

Generally, a rise in the number of long positions in the market hint at an increase in bullish sentiment around an asset.

As pet the chart, The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick. This indicated that BTC‚Äôs bearish price action might end soon. 

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved southwards, meaning that the possibility of BTC falling further can‚Äôt be ruled out yet.

 HELLO TRADERS  

The overall trend remains downward as long as trading stays below the turning level of 60.838 .

Currently, prices are below this level, suggesting a potential decline towards the first support level at 57.147 . If a 4-hour candle closes below this support, further declines are expected, targeting the second support level at 54.727 .

For prices to increase, the turning level must be broken and stabilized above, which could lead to a rise towards the first resistance level at 63.586 , and potentially further to 65.727 .

 KEY LEVELS : 
 
 Turning Level : 60.838 .
 Resistance Levels : 63.586 , 65.760

Bitcoin is sitting at the lows of the larger range, right on a key area of support. Things look predictably shaky, not much for bulls to hang their hats on at the moment, as price continues to drift down. 

Does that mean new lows are coming? No. It means we have the crappy price action that we tend to see at this part of the cycle, and little else.

That said, if you are the type to buy support as a trader, the risk reward here is decent for a quick trade. I won‚Äôt be taking it.

üì£ Kazuo Ueda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, announced that if the economy and inflation progress as expected, the bank will continue raising interest rates. In a statement to a government panel led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, he noted that the economic environment remains favorable, and adjusted interest rates for inflation remain negative, even after the main rate hike in late July. This increase, the first in decades, led to the unwinding of yen carry trades and volatility in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

üìä Market Impact:
Ueda's comments increased demand for the yen, bringing the USD/JPY exchange rate down from 147 to 145.85. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures dropped by 0.5%, and Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell by 0.4%. The Bank of Japan's tightening policy contrasts with expectations of rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, which could further strengthen the yen against other currencies.

üåç Global Ripple Effects:
This scenario may force traders to sell risky investments and repay yen-denominated loans, impacting global markets.

üí° Yen Carry Trade Unwind:
The unwinding of yen carry trades, a strategy of borrowing yen and investing in higher-yielding assets, has already disrupted markets, contributing to Bitcoin's decline from $70,000 to $50,000 in the past month. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, warned that the continued unwinding of these trades could destabilize markets unless central banks increase money supply by expanding their balance sheets. Japan's long-standing low-interest policy had fueled widespread yen carry trades, with the Japanese government involved in around $20 trillion of such trades as of last October, according to Deutsche Bank.

Bitcoin has started September on a weak note, with both its monthly and weekly closes reflecting a lack of bullish momentum. Historically, September has been a challenging month for Bitcoin, often dubbed a ‚Äúred patch‚Äù for returns. 

Despite this, some analysts still see the potential for Bitcoin to reach the mid-$60,000 range in the short term. The $56,000 and $54,000 levels are being eyed by traders as possible short-term targets before any relief rally. 

A clear spot buyer around $57,000 has provided some support, but the overall lack of interest in derivatives markets indicates that funding rates may remain low or negative.

üìä#BTC reaches support zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, falling below the neckline means that a larger short structure has emerged, and the overall trend direction is biased towards the short side. A break below the bullish defense level at the 4-hour level means we have swept the liquidity pools, so a strong rebound is reasonable. There are two resistances we can see at present. One is resistance near the neckline 57093, and the other is strong resistance near the turning point 58250.

‚û°Ô∏èFrom the perspective of wave theory, we can clearly see an Elliott pulse wave. Wave 5 stops exactly in the support zone, so it is also expected to rebound.

‚û°Ô∏èBut the overall direction is biased towards the downward trend. If we want to reverse this trend, we need to build a long structure above the hourly level near the support area. Otherwise, don‚Äôt be too optimistic.

Liquidations have cascaded after a strong sell off happened into Asia open.

The drop has intensified probably because of  Nvidia 

 NASDAQ:NVDA , posted the biggest single-day loss of market cap by any stock in history today.

Open Interest ramped up noticeably as perps are trying to lift the market on  ByBi t and  Bitfinex  after the strong selling led by  Coinbase .

Open interest has now completely reset and CVD is picking up as well.

We had a strong down move taking the previous low at 56k

Now what we want to see is for the price to find acceptance back into VAL  (value area low) 

If we can hold 56k here, I'm expecting a move toward 57.8k

And if we can flip 57k into support, an expansion to 58.6k to 59.2k is very likely.

We didn't receive a trade signal from the internal demand zones during the retracement as expected. Instead, the price action moved decisively through these zones fulfilling the target of the PO3.

Yesterday,  Bitcoin  bounced off the sell zone of $59,000-$59,550, which we noted on Monday. We tested the $58,000 zone, where we saw a volume reaction, but there was no consolidation above this mark, and the buyer did not resume.
After that, we began to implement the scenario with a test of the $56,000 level.

At the moment, the price action is quite weak, and the lows are also being updated weakly, but at this stage, opening long positions is too risky. Above, we have a sell zone of $58,000-$59,400, and only after consolidating above it does it make sense to look for a long position. Until then, we will remain in a stable bearish trend.
There is a high probability of a full breakout of the local low and a test of the global buyer zone of $53,000-$50,000, so we are waiting for the culmination and for now, we are sitting without positions on the first cryptocurrency.

 Sell zones:  level: $58,000-$59,400 (mirror volume zone), $63,000-$64,300 (zone of accumulated volumes).

 Buy zones:  $53,000-$50,000 (zone of large volume anomalies), level $48,000.

 Interesting altcoins.
 
Yesterday we looked at the  ORDI  coin, for which we received a reaction from the marked zone of $31-$30.3, but unfortunately, there was no full rebound, and a volume defense from sales appeared above.
At the moment, a more interesting situation is developing for this asset.
We tested an important volume zone located below, from which a strong buying reaction followed. Large cluster anomalies were formed at the price of $29.6. Upon returning to this mark, we may see a full reversal with the potential to renew the level of $32.85

Bitcoin  is moving near the  Support zone($58,000-$56,600) .

Regarding  Classic Technical Analysis , Bitcoin seems to have succeeded in breaking the upper line of the  Falling Wedge Pattern . It is also possible to form the  Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern .

Regarding  Elliott wave theory , Bitcoin seems to have completed the  Double Three Correction(WXY) . This wave is part of  Corrective Waves .

Also, we can see  Regular Divergence(RD+)  between  Consecutive Valleys .

I expect Bitcoin to go  UP  to at least the  target of the   Falling Wedge Pattern .

My previous post titled " Bitcoin Analysis==>> Pumping Again==>>Short term
 " is  still valid 

 Note: If Bitcoin loses the Support zone($58,000-$56,600), we should expect Bitcoin to fall to $55,000(at least).

In the ever-turbulent seas of the market, where every wave could be a treasure or a trap, there's an often overlooked strategy: doing absolutely nothing. Yes, you heard that right. Sometimes, the best action is inaction, or as traders like to call it, "sitting on your hands."

In the grand universe of trading, sitting on your hands isn't about doing nothing; it's strategic waiting. It's like being a cosmic sniper, waiting for that perfect shot where the probability of success is overwhelmingly in your favor. So, embrace the wait, enjoy the pause, and when the market structure shifts in a way that aligns with your strategy, then you make your move. Until then, keep your hands warm and your wit sharp.

In this scenario, we retest $58k and move lower to reach the low at $54.6k. These price moves should be watched closely as they can become volatile with falling stock prices and economic data. Today the JOLTS job openings will be released which could cause volatility. If the economic data turns out to be bad for the dollar in the next few days, the upside scenario could continue and we would re-enter the area where we are trading sideways.

#Bitcoin Update on Wednesday, September 4, 2024

Assalamu Alaikum and good morning to all brothers and sisters,

# Bitcoin continues to drop and has broken all our support levels. It appears that the bears are currently more powerful than the bulls. We are now down to our last chance (Arrow #4), as this is the only support remaining. It has already been broken on both the daily and 4-hour charts. On the 4-hour chart, it has been retested, and today‚Äôs daily candle will serve as the retest candle.

**What's Next?**  
We now need a very strong catalyst to reverse the trend; otherwise, the price is likely to drop further. Please refer to the red and blue paths for guidance. We should avoid any new buy trades and instead look for sell trades starting tomorrow if today's candle confirms the drop.

# ALTS  
The situation is the same with altcoins; they are also dropping drastically. My advice remains unchanged: do not initiate any new buy trades until we have a confirmed reversal. For sell trades, I will be looking to start from tomorrow, though I may send some signals today as well.

I wish you all a very nice day.

When the BTCUSDT hourly chart is examined; It is observed that the price movements continue in a downward trend. As long as the crypto's level of 58449 cannot be passed upwards, it is evaluated that in price movements below the level of 57210, it can break the level of 55685 and retreat to the level of 53952.

BTC Losing Bullish Momentum 

In our previous analysis, BTC performed as expected, creating a correction. 
This was the ideal scenario before the onset of a bearish wave.

Today, the release of the US PCE data could potentially drive BTC lower.

Last night, BTC tested the $61K resistance zone, which was close to our reversal zone, increasing the likelihood of a bearish movement.

If everything goes as anticipated, BTC should test the $56.1K and $50K levels.

 You may find more details in the chart!

Here's an analysis of the latest BTC/USDT chart on the 4-hour timeframe:

1.Overall Trend:
   - The chart shows a continuation of the downtrend within a clearly defined descending channel, marked by the parallel blue lines. This suggests persistent bearish sentiment in the market.

2.Support and Resistance Levels:
   - Key support levels are around 57,000 USDT and 55,000 USDT. The price recently tested the lower boundary of the channel near 56,000 USDT and shows a potential attempt to hold this level.
   - Resistance levels are visible at approximately 58,000 USDT, 59,000 USDT, and the upper boundary of the descending channel. These levels will be crucial for any bullish reversal attempts.

3.Recent Price Movement:
   - BTC has been making lower highs and lower lows, adhering closely to the descending channel pattern.
   - A recent sharp drop took the price close to the 56,000 USDT mark, indicating increased selling pressure.
   - The price briefly touched the lower boundary of the descending channel, suggesting that the downtrend remains intact.

4.Potential Scenarios:
   -Bearish Continuation: If the price fails to break above the descending channel, it could continue its downward trajectory, potentially testing the 55,000 USDT support level.
   -Bullish Reversal: A break above the upper boundary of the descending channel and subsequent resistance at 58,000 USDT could indicate a potential reversal or at least a short-term relief rally.

5.Volume and Momentum:
   - The absence of volume data on the chart makes it challenging to gauge the strength behind recent moves, but the price action suggests continued weakness.
   - Watch for divergence between price and momentum indicators (such as RSI, if available) that might hint at a weakening of the downtrend or the beginning of a reversal.

6.Market Sentiment:
   - The persistent downtrend within the channel shows that the market sentiment remains bearish.
   - Traders should monitor how the price interacts with the key support at 55,000 USDT and resistance at the channel boundaries for signs of trend changes.

In summary, BTC is currently in a strong downtrend, with key support levels at 56,000 USDT and 55,000 USDT. The market remains bearish, and any potential bullish reversal would require a break above the descending channel and confirmation above resistance levels around 58,000 USDT. Keep an eye on price action and market reactions at these critical levels.
___
In my opinion, Bitcoin will rise a little and continue its decline from there
___
Macro Overview

- Investors have withdrawn over 2,500 BTC, keeping the total balance stable at just over three million BTC. Additionally, more than $287.8 million has been pulled out of spot Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting an increase in risk-averse sentiment. Retail investors are becoming more cautious, and the lack of strong catalysts is dampening overall optimism.

Technical Analysis

- BTCUSD retested around 60,000, coinciding with the 78-day EMA, before sharply declining. The price is currently within a descending channel, signaling a sideways-to-downward trend. If BTCUSD recovers above 60,000, the price could retest the resistance at 61,800. Meanwhile, a close below 56,650 may suggest a further decline to the next support level at 54,600.
___
structure has been intact for some time, showing consistent lower highs and lower lows. 


The horizontal support line at approximately $52,408 is a key level to watch. It has previously acted as a significant support zone, suggesting that any retest of this level could provide a strong base for a potential upward movement. 


The chart features a prominent arrow suggesting a bullish reversal from near the lower support line and $52,408. This implies an expectation that the price will find support here and begin an upward move toward the upper boundary of the descending channel. 


The upper trendline of the channel around $68,000 serves as the primary resistance level. A breakout above this level would indicate a significant shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to a larger bullish move. 


The broader trend within the channel remains bearish until a breakout occurs. However, the emphasis on the support level and projected upward movement indicate a cautious bullish outlook in the short term, pending confirmation of a reversal signal. 


The chart suggests that BTC is nearing a critical support zone of around $52,408, where a potential long opportunity could arise if the price action confirms a bounce. The key to a sustained bullish trend will be breaking above the descending channel‚Äôs resistance line, currently near $68,000. If this occurs, it would likely trigger a more pronounced upward trend. 

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.

Hello everyone,

Let's analyse BTCUSDT in daily Timeframe!!

Bitcoin is currently trading within a defined pattern. The recent low volume and weak momentum has been driving the price downward.
Analyzing the 4hr chart reveals a potential Head and Shoulders pattern, suggesting a possible bearish reversal. The 200-day Moving Average (MA) is proving to be a significant resistance level.
Bitcoin has frequently bounced off the green support zone between $56,611 and $58,038, indicating weakening support. However, there is a risk of a further decline towards the lower trendline of the pattern, which aligns with the 400-day MA.
Liquidity is concentrated below $55,700, creating a potential support zone around $53,000.
A daily close above $60,863 could signal a bullish reversal.

Current Support Levels :
$56611 to $57255 (short term)
$52895
$48950

Resistance Levels:
$59636
$60863

üíé#BITCOIN  / ‚è±4-hour Timeframe

üëâAfter encountering significant resistance at the weekly channel's midline and the weekly #BITCOIN resistance (59661.3):

‚úÖWe anticipated a decline. However, whether this decline will continue depends on the structure that formsüßê

üîªOn the 1-hour timeframe, after falling from the weekly resistance, we've witnessed the formation of a head and shoulders channelüîª

Fractal Analysis 
 
 Fractals in trading help identify potential reversal points by marking significant price changes. Our strategy calculates a "fractal value" by comparing the current price to recent high and low fractal points. This is done by evaluating the sum of distances from the current closing price to the recent highs and lows. A positive fractal value suggests proximity to recent lows, hinting at upward momentum. Conversely, a negative value indicates closeness to recent highs, signaling potential downward movement.
 

 Moving Averages for Confirmation 
 
 We use a series of 20 moving averages ranging from 5 to 100 to confirm trend directions indicated by fractal analysis. An entry signal is considered bullish when shorter-term moving averages are all above a long-term moving average, aligning with a positive fractal value.
 
 
 Exit Strategy 
 
 The strategy employs dynamic stop-loss levels set at various moving averages, allowing for partial exits when the price crosses below specific thresholds. This helps manage the trade by locking in profits gradually. A full exit might be triggered by strong reversal signals suggested by both fractal values and moving average trends.

üìä#BTC ideal target zone has been achieved‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural point of view, the target area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe long structure built in the yellow support area has been fully realized, so we need to be alert to the risk of a pullback. We are currently in the red selling zone, and it is unreasonable to chase the rise. Unless we can build a new long structure or break through the selling zone again, don't be too optimistic.

‚û°Ô∏èAt the same time, all the long orders we held in the support area have been closed. Congratulations to our friends who followed Wolf King to print money and received generous returns. üí∞üçª

Setting these points is both an art and a science, much like navigating through space. Each trade is a journey, and while we can't predict every meteor shower or black hole, we can plan our route to maximize safety and profit.

Remember, the market, like space, is vast and unpredictable. Your SL, Entry, and TP are your navigation tools. Use them wisely, adjust as necessary, and always be prepared for the unexpected.
