Page 1, Article 1: ‚û°Ô∏èBitcoin is heading for a massive bear market in 2024/2025! If you are new to crypto, you may miss information about usual Bitcoin volatility; precisely, Bitcoin crashes by 80% - 90% every 3rd year. Of course this is not natural, it's caused by tremendous manipulation by Cabal (banks, governments, world's organizations (WEF, WHO, etc...). They all work together while giving you an illusion. Of course their goal is to enslave humans with nanotechnologies, artificial intelligence, a neurolink from Elon Musk (that will be connected to your brain), a credit score system, and 1 world digital currency (Bitcoin), forced jabs, etc... All these technologies are completely incompatible with the human body and cause massive depression, anxiety and cancer. In today's world, we can already see how many people are in a depression state by these technologies.

‚û°Ô∏èThey will not tell you that every human naturally possesses strong abilities, such as Telekinesis (move objects with your mind) or Telepathy (you don't really need to use your phone to communicate over long distances). There are natural abilities that every human can do without exception. And I don't want to talk about magic powers, leaving your physical body during sleep (astral travel) or meditation, maybe in the next post. These are abilities the Cabal doesn't want you to use.

‚û°Ô∏èOn the weekly chart, we can see that Bitcoin is heading downward, I expect 28k to be hit in 2025. Of course markets move in waves, and we have many minor levels on the way down. We have the 100 and 200 weekly moving averages at the same place, 0.382 FIB retracement, fair value gaps, and 0.618 FIB retracement. I will keep you updated once we reach these important levels!
Page 1, Article 2: My fellow traders, here we have a classic bearish chart setup.

‚ûñ Bitcoin has been consolidation with a bearish bias now for six months straight; it has been printing lower highs.

‚ûñ Volume has been dominant on the bearish side and the BTC side of the Altcoins market is decidedly bullish. These signals are telling us that Bitcoin is likely to move down next; another leg down.

‚ûñ This move can develop within the next 3-14 days, thus making this a timing trade. Potentially, a "great entry timing."

I am wishing you profits and good luck.

Page 1, Article 3: BINANCE:BTCUSDT  is strengthening after a false breakdown of the 54.5K - 55K support. Fundamentally and technically, there is no buyer motivation. Traders have moved into the waiting or selling phase...

  

Now BTC is accumulated mainly by wallets with balance < 1BTC... Larger wallets are not doing much. Also, judging by the statistics of various services it can be seen that the trading activity of large investors has decreased, and whales have stopped actively accumulating since August. Traders doubt the current rebound in BTC and continue to actively short it.
Technically, the coin shows negative, bearish dynamics, forming gradually declining highs without the possibility to approach the retest of local peaks.
For the last one and a half or two months a tight sideways range has been formed and MM continues to keep the price inside the flat, it is also worth paying attention to the descending resistance, which also prevents the market from going up, putting pressure together with SMA-200.

 Resistance Levels: SMA200, 59600, Trend Line
Support levels: 57736, 56K, 54500 

At the moment the price is consolidating in the bullish zone, which indicates a possible chance to rise to 59600. The situation may end with a short-squeeze and further decline after liquidity capture. The pressure from sellers continues and buyers are not ready yet

Page 1, Article 4: Bitcoin is going to hit $100,000 in 2025... I am going to breakdown how everything will develop in a few minutes.

How are you feeling in this beautiful Saturday/Sunday?

The correction is not yet over. When the correction is over we will have bullish action, of course, but bullish action doesn't mean straight up, it simply means higher highs and higher lows. There will be fluctuations, shakeouts, swings and all types of market moves in-between.

The correction bottom comes in and growth immediately follows for a month or two and then another drop. This drop can end in a higher low or lower low (around November), makes no difference. After this drop we enter the accumulation phase and things will slow down.

While Bitcoin moves slowly, slow and steady growth, these Altcoins that I've been sharing now will have their best period in some 4, 5, 6 years.

December 2024, January and February 2025 Bitcoin will be slow but still higher, moving up, recovering. Full speed starts to develop right after February, at the beginning of March 2025. We can say it will take some time to break resistance, the barriers, and so after March/April 2025 we can see the light and we are now aiming toward $100,000. I don't know if it will hit right on April or May or later down the road, but it will take a while.

In short, Bitcoin is likely to hit $100,000 after March 2025.

All the period before this date the Altcoins will shine. The Altcoins will shine because Bitcoin will be growing slowly, kind of sideways; bullish accumulation/consolidation. It will be obvious that the 2024 corrective phase is a thing of the past and everybody will be preparing for the new All-Time High in the latter part of 2025.

We are likely to get a blow-off top in 2025. Not like 2021 but more like 2017. Remember this.

The numbers are pointing toward 190,000 as the top but we will have to add inflation and God knows about market hype. So it can go to 220,000 if things go great.

If things go bad, for whatever reason, we can peak around 150K.

Sounds good?

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.

We are going to look at a classic now, everybody on TradingView knows this one; MA200.

‚ûñ When Bitcoin, or any Cryptocurrency for that matter, trades below MA200 on the daily timeframe we consider this bearish long-term.

‚ûñ When the trading is happening above this level, it is considered bullish.

‚ûñ Bitcoin is currently trading below MA200 on the daily timeframe.

‚ûñ MA200 sits right now at exactly $64,000.

Page 1, Article 10: Hello traders,

Bitcoin price tested 53k support area again and currently is in a correction phase.

I expect BTC price to trade in the range between 53k and 61k before 18th September when the FED expected to cut rates. 
After that event all markets might plunge in the short term but in the long term this should be bullish.
Considering all this, it's highly important for Bitcoin price to hold above the 50k area in the short term before all markets will start to recover.

Will Bitcoin manage to hold a 50k support area is another question but if it fails to do so then we might see BTC reaching 47k or even 42k areas. 
But in any case I don't expect the price to stay at those levels for too long as it is more likely to recover quickly.

Please, do not forget to boost this idea and leave your comments below, thanks.
Page 1, Article 11: Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. Some days ago price declined to the resistance level, which coincided with the resistance zone, and at once rebounded up to the trend line. After this, BTC turned around and made a strong impulse down, breaking 63900 with 53200 levels, but soon turned around again and rose higher than the 53200 level, making a fake breakout of it. Next, the price started to grow and later it grew almost to a resistance level, where it some time traded. Then the price rose to the resistance zone, where it touched the trend line one more time and then started to decline. In a short time, BTC fell to the support level, which coincided with the support zone, and a not long time ago it rebounded and started to move up. So, in my mind, I expect that BTCUSDT will make little correction movement and continue to grow to the trend line. For this case, I set two goals, first at the - 57400 points, and second at the 60600 points, which coincides with the trend line.

Page 1, Article 13: üì£Despite the recent decline in Bitcoin's price, "Michael Saylor", a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency market, continues to advocate for holding onto Bitcoin. This comes as some analysts, citing recent US employment data, anticipate a potential interest rate cut by the "Federal Reserve", which could drive up riskier assets like Bitcoin. In this analysis, we will delve into the technical reasons supporting this viewüëáüëáüëá

üî•#Bitcoin / ‚è±Daily Timeframe
üìå#Bitcoin failed to reach above the bearish channel on the weekly timeframe during its previous bull-trend.

üîªSubsequently, it has retested the channel's bottom with the recent decline.

üöÄAs a result, there is potential for growth based on a double bottom pattern and a triple divergence, targeting the channel's upper boundary.

‚úÖThis rally could initiate from the current channel bottom or the support zone of $49,000.00 - $50,096.10.

‚ö†Ô∏èIf it rallies from the channel bottom and reaches the first target of $57,877.90, a pullback to retest the second support zone is likely before a substantial uptrend resumes‚ÄºÔ∏è

üôÖRegardless, a breakout above the first target ($57,877.90), which is a crucial resistance level on the daily timeframe, is essential for the uptrend to continue‚úÖüöÄ

üéØSubsequent targets include:
üöÄTarget 2: $66,755.85
üöÄüöÄTarget 3: $74,537.70

‚ùåThe stop-loss for the bullish scenario is a breakout below the bearish channel and a daily candle close below $49,000.00 on the weekly timeframe.

üîÑIn this case, the trend would shift from bullish to bearish, potentially targeting $41,218.20 and then $34,494.20üëÜüëá

Page 1, Article 15: Hello Traders! 
What are your thoughts on BITCOIN ?
Bitcoin has been in an upward trend in recent days, showing significant strength. However, the price is now approaching a key resistance zone that could potentially lead to a temporary correction.
Given this resistance, we anticipate a correction in this area. This correction could present an opportunity for traders to enter the market.
It is recommended that traders closely monitor this resistance zone and wait for the correction to complete before considering entry. Once the correction is over, we expect Bitcoin to resume its upward movement and potentially reach new highs.

Page 1, Article 16: Hello everyone,

Today, I‚Äôve prepared an educational guide on chart patterns, specifically focusing on the Flag Pattern.

This content is designed to be easy for beginners to follow, so I hope you find it engaging and informative. :)

Below is the outline I‚Äôll be using for this post:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Outline 

1. What is a Flag Pattern?
 
  Definition
  Key Components
  Characteristics
 

2. Bullish Flag Pattern
 
 Basic Characteristics
 Examples
 

3. Bearish Flag Pattern
 
 Basic Characteristics
 Examples
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 1. What is a Flag Pattern? 

 1) Definition 
 
 A Flag Pattern forms during a brief consolidation phase after a strong price movement, often signaling the continuation of a trend. It typically appears when prices make a sharp move, either up or down, followed by a period of sideways or slightly counter-trend movement.
 Flag Patterns can occur in both uptrends and downtrends, named for their resemblance to an actual flag. After a strong price move, the market consolidates briefly before continuing in the original trend direction.
 

 2) Key Components 
 
 Flagpole: The initial strong price movement that sets the overall trend direction before the consolidation phase.
 Flag: The consolidation period where prices move sideways or slightly counter to the trend, often forming a rectangle or parallelogram. This phase typically occurs with a decrease in trading volume.
 Breakout: The moment when the price resumes its original trend direction. In an uptrend, this is an upward breakout, and in a downtrend, a downward breakout, confirming the continuation of the trend.
 

 3) Characteristics 
 
 Duration: The Flag Pattern typically lasts longer than the Flagpole but varies depending on the timeframe.
 Volume: Volume usually decreases during the Flag‚Äôs formation and increases once the breakout occurs.
 Reliability: The Flag Pattern is considered a reliable indicator of trend continuation, making it a favorite among traders using trend-based strategies.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 2. Bullish Flag Pattern 

 1) Basic Characteristics 
 
 A Bullish Flag forms after a strong upward price movement, signaling a temporary consolidation phase. During this consolidation, volume typically decreases, suggesting that the market is pausing rather than reversing. After this phase, the price often continues its upward trend, accompanied by an increase in volume. Bullish Flag Patterns also help relieve overbought conditions in technical indicators, providing the market with a chance to prepare for another move up.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 This chart from May 2023 shows a strong Flagpole followed by a long consolidation phase (Flag). The volume then increased as the price broke out, completing the Bullish Flag Pattern.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this chart from March 2021, we see a similar setup: a strong Flagpole, followed by a consolidation phase, leading to a breakout that continued the upward trend.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Bearish Flag Pattern 

 1) Basic Characteristics 
 
 The Bearish Flag Pattern is the inverse of the Bullish Flag. It follows a strong downward move (Flagpole) and is followed by a period of consolidation (Flag) with decreasing volume. Like its bullish counterpart, the Bearish Flag can relieve oversold conditions, leading to a continuation of the downtrend after a breakout.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 This chart from May 2022 displays a Bearish Flag Pattern: a strong downward Flagpole, followed by a Flag consolidation phase. After the consolidation, a breakout occurred, continuing the downtrend.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 This chart from February 2022 also illustrates a strong downward Flagpole, followed by a consolidation phase (Flag), leading to a breakout that completed the Bearish Flag Pattern.
 This guide will help you better understand the Flag Pattern and how it can be used in your trading strategy effectively!
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Conclusion 
 I hope the various Flag Patterns and market analysis techniques covered in this post prove helpful in your investment journey. Chart analysis is not merely a technical skill but also a deeper understanding of market psychology and movement. Flag Patterns, along with other chart patterns, visually reflect the psychological dynamics of the market. Mastering their use can greatly contribute to successful trading.

That being said, the crypto market is inherently unpredictable and fast-moving. While technical analysis is a valuable tool, it‚Äôs important to adopt a comprehensive approach that considers broader market trends and external factors. I encourage you to apply the insights gained from this post with a balanced and cautious perspective when making investment decisions.

New opportunities are constantly emerging, and those who are prepared to seize them will find success. The chart represents the market‚Äôs voice. Listening to it, interpreting it, and making informed decisions based on that interpretation is "the essence" of chart analysis.

I sincerely hope that, through continuous learning and experience, you‚Äôll evolve into a more confident and successful investor.
Page 1, Article 17: In this analysis I want to take a look at BTC's short-term price action: what can we expect over the next few days?

As seen on the chart, the price is currently slightly reversing from the diagonal purple resistance. It's too early to call for a reversal, but we have to be cautious nevertheless.

On the bottom you can see the RSI indicator flashing overbought. The previous 2 times this occurred it caused a reversal.

This is exactly the same as today: RSI overbought and hitting resistance. This is not a time to be bullish. I'd wait for the price to pierce through the resistance. For aggressive bears, however, this seems like a perfect bearish swing-trade.
Page 1, Article 18: hello guys.

let's dive into the monthly time frame of btc analysis.


 Breakout Confirmation:  
The candle highlighted in yellow, initially suspected to be a "hunting candle," has not confirmed its status as such. With 6 subsequent candles failing to validate a hunting pattern, it is more likely a breakout candle indicating a continuation of the bullish trend.

 Scenario Probability:
 The more probable scenario suggests a continued upward movement, targeting the next significant resistance level above $72,000.
The scenario where the price touches the lower level (around $42,000) is less likely, given the strong bullish momentum and support levels seen in the recent price action.

Page 1, Article 20: hello guys.

 Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern:  The chart highlights a clear Inverse Head and Shoulders formation, a well-known bullish reversal pattern. The left shoulder, head, and right shoulder are well-defined, signaling a potential trend reversal from the previous downtrend.

 Breakout Above the Neckline:  The price has broken above the neckline, which confirms the reversal pattern. This is typically a strong bullish signal indicating further upward momentum.

 Engulfing Pattern:  An Engulfing pattern at the right shoulder supports the bullish case, suggesting the buyers are gaining control, pushing the price higher.

 Next Target: The projected target for this breakout is $62,000, which is indicated on the chart. This would be the next key resistance level where traders might take profits or reassess positions. 
 
Pullback Potential:  There is also a possibility of a minor pullback to retest the breakout area (around $58,500), which would act as support before continuing upward.

Page 1, Article 21: Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. By observing the chart, we can see that the price not long ago declined in a downward channel, where it dropped from the resistance line to the seller zone, which coincided with the resistance level. Then the price bounced up and tried to grow, but soon continued to fall. In a short time, BTC declined below the 57900 level, but later turned around and rose to the resistance line of the channel, after which it reversed and fell to the support line of the downward channel. Then the price rose to the 57900 level and even entered the seller zone, after which it dropped to the support level, exiting the downward channel, and soon broke the 54800 level, falling even lower. But after this, Bitcoin turned around and started to grow inside the upward channel, quickly rising to the 54800 level, which coincided with the buyer zone, and broke it again. Next, the price rose to the resistance level of the channel, after which it rolled down. So, in my opinion, BTC can decline a little more and then start to move up to the resistance line of the upward channel, thereby breaking the resistance level. In this case, I set my TP at 59000 points, which coincides with this line. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ

Page 1, Article 23: The price perfectly fulfills my previous idea. It hit target level.  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  in continues to trend downward, showing a lack of buying pressure since the last week of August. The price action has consistently produced lower lows and lower closes. Even on the daily timeframe, we‚Äôre seeing these lower lows, despite a recent false breakout below the July low, with the price hovering around that area once again. Historically, September has been a challenging month for Bitcoin, often showing negative performance. This suggests there is a likelihood of the price moving further down, possibly breaching the 50,000 level and targeting the support zone between 48,000 and 45,000. Should the price reach this area, we could potentially see a strong bounce and the beginning of a new bullish trend. My target is support level at 51220.00

Page 2, Article 1: As you can see, BTC has created an ascending head and shoulders and , which has just been broken in the 4-hour time frame and this means that the price can be bullish and I expect the price to go up to the  Fibonacci line of 0.618 = 60k .  Stay tuned for more updates, thanks 

BTC From a different point of view !!!



Previous Analysis
Page 2, Article 2: It is observed that price is traded within a band (blue channel) forming a pattern known as the bullish flag which is highlighted (green) pole and a trading channel (blue). 
This present a massive opportunity as this chart structure indicates a prospective price rise of about 70%. 
This also aligns with the other fundamentals like the US elections in November as usually market makers will take position before significant events.

The idea is to buy at the lower troughs of the blue channel while expecting a price break-out to about $88,000

ACTION PLAN
50,560-53,770	-- BUY
50,550 -48,659	--WAIT/ DO NOTHING 
BELOW 48,396	--SELL

However, this trade idea gives a risk reward  ratio of 8.9.

Goodluck!!
Page 2, Article 3: Bitcoin Growth Perspective up to 65K
 
Currently, BTC is consolidating, and preparing for its next significant move. 
The key resistance level at $59,600 is important for Bitcoin to overcome to gain further upside momentum

 Technical Analysis 
59.600 price level has been identified as a significant resistance point. 
Breaking through this zone could signal a strong bullish trend which can push Bitcoin up to 62500 which corresponds to another stronger zone.

Continued interest from institutional investors can provide the necessary capital inflow to push BTC past these resistance levels.

Positive regulatory developments can boost market confidence, aiding in the upward movement of Bitcoin.

Global economic conditions, including inflation rates and monetary policies, will also play a significant role in Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory.

Page 2, Article 4: Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Observing the chart, we can see that the price some time ago entered to the range, where it at once reached the top part, which coincided with the resistance level and then dropped. BTC fell to the bottom part of the range, which coincided with the current resistance level, and at once rebounded and started to move up. In a short time, the price reached the 61800 level, and broke it, thereby exiting from the range also. Next, the price made a small movement up, after which turned around and started to decline inside the downward channel, where BTC broke the 61800 level one more time. Later, the price declined to the support line of the channel, and at once rose to the resistance line and continued to move down. Price fell to the 56600 level and broke it, after which made a retest and continued to decline. For this case, I think that Bitcoin can make a small movement up and then continue to decline inside the downward channel. Therefore I set my TP at 51000 points.

üìà As per our latest analysis, attached on the chart, BTC has rejected the $50,000 - $52,000 support zone and has been trading higher since then.

As long as the bulls remain in control,  a continuation towards the $61,000 - $62,000 resistance zone is expected.

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

Page 2, Article 7: Hello my dear friends, another weekly session is over and new data becomes available. 
Let's review those in an unbiased way and see what the chart is saying.

‚ûñ The 2-Sept. week just closed at 54,869. This is after being rejected by EMA34.
‚ûñ It is the first time that Bitcoin closes below EMA34 in more than a year.
‚ûñ It is the worst weekly close since Bitcoin moved above 60,000 in February.
‚ûñ It is the worst weekly close, coming out of a major high, since November 2021.

‚ûñ The weekly session also closed below the 0.382 Fib. retracement level relative to the bullish wave that started in September 2023; a major support lost.

‚û¢ Everything is ultra-bearish. 

‚ûñ The weekly session that just closed also ended as a Doji but red. Signaling the continuation of the previous candle. The previous candle was a full red candle.

‚û¢ Everything is so bearish that we need not go any further.

I would love to entertain you more but it would be a waste of time.

All the signals coming from this chart are saying that  Bitcoin is about to crash .

Namaste.

Page 2, Article 9: On a smaller timeframe, we see yet another good start for a potential rejection to happen near 100EMA. 

So far, sellers seem to take dominance near this zone, which is good for us. 

We are looking here for further pressure from sellers and eventually a further downward movement from here!

  Bitcoin price is in the ascending Triangle with means the bitcoin price can react to this situation and breaks the triangle and will go up. and the most important resistance for Btc is currently 61k if the price breaks this resistance, Bitcoin can reach the top of the megaphone. 

 Analysis Summary: 
Current Situation:
Bitcoin is struggling to break the important $61,000 level. This level is crucial for further upward movement.
 Potential Scenarios: 
If Bitcoin successfully surpasses the $61,000 level, it could indicate a bullish trend continuation.
Failure to break this level might lead to a consolidation phase or a potential bearish reversal, especially if it falls below the support level at $51K.
Conclusion:
The chart combines multiple technical analysis tools to provide a comprehensive view of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential price movements. Traders will be watching the $61,000 level closely, as breaking it could signal a strong bullish trend, while failing to do so might lead to a bearish scenario.

Page 2, Article 18: Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price some time ago rebounded from the resistance level and dropped lower than the support level, which coincided with the support zone. After this, BTC turned around and in a short time rose higher than the 53900 level, breaking it, and then continued to grow to the resistance level. When the price reached this level, it some time traded near it, after which made the correction and later backed up to the 61200 level. Soon, BTC broke this level and then reached a trend line, after which the price turned around and dropped lower 61200 level, breaking it one more time and continuing to decline. Price declined near the trend line to the support zone, after which the price turned around and made an impulse up, breaking the trend line. At the moment, BTC continues to move up, so, I expect that price will continue to move up to 61200 resistance level. For this case, my goal is this level.

Page 2, Article 20: After Bitcoin retraced nearly 19% from its recent highs, I believe it hasn‚Äôt yet reached the average cycle correction of around 22%, which could take the price down to about $57,500. In a more bearish scenario, the correction could deepen to 25%, or even extend toward $50,000‚Äã.

Factoring in U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, will drive short-term volatility, it is likely that it will lead to market downturns before any stable recovery‚Äã. Even if BTC does put higher and reach near $65,000,the short term upside would be capped as major selling pressure is likely to appear there. This makes the $60,500 level a reasonable point to short with a target of 
 around $59,000 at the 200EMA.
Page 2, Article 21: My dear follower, it is truly my pleasure to be able to share another moment with you. We have many charts, many options to choose from, but nothing creates so much curiosity like Bitcoin. Nothing creates so much anticipation and doubt, as to what will happen next, like Bitcoin. Nothing is more interesting than Bitcoin, because we are all financially involved.

Well, we are not all financially involved... If we are not, we hope to be one day.

Bitcoin is the best invention, the greatest innovation, since the Internet, hot water and baked bread; that's how great this technology really is.

It might sound like joke, funny, but it is the truth. What can be more important than money to a civilization like ours? That needs it everyday in order to exchange, to communicate. What can be more important than virtual money, digital cash, in the age of the Internet?

Everything we do, think, feel or experience now happens through our phones. The way I am communicating with you right now is through technology and a technology that is expanding but was limited, because the money it used was pretty old.

Bitcoin is Internet money.
Bitcoin already changed the world.
This is only the beginning...

Let's read the chart!

The bullish impulse in late 2023 is characterized by green candles only and straight up. There is only one candle that is red. Volume is green as well. This is the 2 weeks timeframe by the way.

Mid-March produces a "doubt" candle. A Doji. Doubt after a major bullish wave.
What is being doubted?

The Japanese who invented this thing call it "uncertainty."
After such strong growth a candle that translates as uncertainty shows up; what is uncertain?

The continuation of the uptrend is what is now longer certain... Sure enough.

After this session, no more growth.
This is beyond TA. No more growth reveals what is happening; no longer growing.

Ok. Volume is rising but the sessions are closing red.
Prices are going down... What should we expect?

I'll tell you what; normally when you are reading these charts you get mixed signals, it becomes hard and confusing. Three signals are pointing up, two signals are pointing down... One indicator is green another is red... I am looking at this chart and wondering; what happened to the bullish signals?

Anyway, the good news is that the crash will happen this same month and in November...

Well, time will tell, but it is getting closer by the day.

You've been here for years and years and years, tell what do you see on this chart!

Page 2, Article 22: Hello everyone, 

This post highlights a series of technical patterns, all converging towards the same target area on Bitcoin. We‚Äôve identified a descending broadening wedge, a cup and handle formation, and another descending broadening formation. 

The alignment of these patterns reinforces our bullish bias on Bitcoin, suggesting that a major upside move is imminent. We believe the potential for a significant rally is stronger now than ever.

 Please share your comments and thoughts on this analysis.

Page 3, Article 1: I want to answer this question right away, for me it's only a matter of time. Of course it will be and even higher

In my opinion, we are seeing consolidation after a strong uptrend, which is normal for financial instruments. And this is even more normal than the volatility we have seen in previous years


At the moment, to continue growth, it is important for us to keep the price above 50,000. If this does not happen then we will go to the next level of support and this is 40,000 and this may mean that we will change the consolidation and go into the downtrend. And I don't think it's the job of big money to let the price go so low 

As we can see from the current test of the support level, the volumes are already much smaller, that is, there are fewer people willing to sell.


Locally our task with the current one is to return and make another attempt at the 60,000 test 


On one of the senior timeframes we can observe a convergence that has not yet formed but has been playing for a very long time 

For now I assume that the support level will hold and we will be able to make another approach to exit the consolidation breakout point is 65.000 and this breakout can send the price to new highs

Page 3, Article 6: Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Observing the chart, we can see that the price some days ago started to grow inside the upward channel, where it in a short time rose to a resistance level, which coincided with the seller zone. Soon, BTC broke this level and rose to the resistance line of the channel, thereby later exiting from it and then turning around and starting to decline inside the pennant. In this pattern, BTC at once fell to the 61000 level, broke it again, and later continued to decline next to the support level, which coincided with the buyer zone. Later, the price broke this level and fell to the support line of the pennant pattern, after which at once started to move up and soon broke the 56100 level one more time. Next, the price continued to grow and reached the resistance line of the pennant, but recently it rolled down a little below and now trades near this line. So, in my opinion, BTC can correct to support line of pennant and then start to grow to a resistance level, thereby leaving this pattern. When the price reaches the 61000 level, it can break it and then continue to move up. For this case, I set my TP at 63000 points. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ

Page 3, Article 8: I wasn't even looking at Bitcoin but opened this chart to check some numbers in relation to ETCBTC, which is ultra-bullish right now and what do I see?

Bitcoin just lost ALL support on the weekly timeframe.

There is only the wick from the 5-Aug. week that's been lower since February. Bearish bias, bearish potential, bearish continuation confirmed for the 300th time.

What is happening is nothing new. This is something that has been in the making for the past six months. Bitcoin gave the first massive, impossible to ignore signal on the 5th of March, six months ago, with the highest bearish volume session on the daily timeframe in years.

The action has been bearish, sideways, down, lower highs and lower lows... The chart tells us the tendency, the market will make up the event that will be the catalyst that produces the crash that we've been seeing developing for so long.

‚ûñ What to make of this situation?
‚ûñ Where do go we from here?
‚ûñ What about Crypto?

This is a positive situation. We are seeing the natural workings of the market first hand. The market grows and shrinks. Money flowing out of Bitcoin will reach other portions of the market and all is well. Everything is as it should be and life is good.

From here, we move to the Altcoins. We enjoy the Altcoins and profit from their rise as Bitcoin crashes. When Bitcoin hits bottom, we can either move back to Bitcoin or continue with the Altcoins, but, when the bottom is hit, the opportunity to buy again presents itself. Better prices, more people, new participants will join. All the gambling, all the weak-hands, all these things will be "corrected," erased, removed from the market and only those that are ready for the long-term will stay in the game. This is again positive, there has always been corrections and corrections will continue to exist for as long as we humans live in a world of duality with good and bad, night and day, left and right, pleasure and pain. This is exactly what the market does. Energy from the moon (down), energy from the sun (up).

Crypto as a whole is becoming better. Crypto as a whole is evolving. What about Crypto?
Cryptocurrency is doing great and will continue to do great. The Cryptocurrency market is evolving and will continue to evolve.

Think of the 2022 bear-market. When Bitcoin crashes, everything crashes. Bitcoin would only hint at moving lower and everything would be down 20-30%. Now we are seeing the lowest prices in months and many pairs are staying strong, ready to move ahead.

Imagine billions upon billions moving from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin, Tron and the rest, to the smaller Altcoins, what do you think will happen? A major bullish wave.

So, when one side of the market is depressed, the other side can grow. We are here, we are adults, we are advanced, we are smart; we can see this dynamic and instead of letting our Bitcoins lose value, we can take action and profit all day long.

‚ûñ What action to take now?
‚ûñ How to survive the correction?

Sell the pairs that are trading high. High can be those trading near March 2024 prices or February 2024 or near their recent peak. Those are no good, for now. Sell those.

Buy those trading low. Low can be those trading near a strong support. Can be a support that is 1 year old, 2-3 years old, etc.

Buy those trading at All-Time Lows or those trading near their October/September 2023 low/support. These are good now and set to grow.

The Tether (USDT) pairs are risky no matter how they look. They will crash when Bitcoin crashes. Period.

The Bitcoin (BTC) pairs are the only way to succeed at this point. Plenty of time we had to take action, plenty of time to prepare. There is still time now because, while Bitcoin has been going down, some of these Altcoins, most of them, are still at their lowest level in 3,4,5 or 6 years; it can't get any better than this. These will grow long-term and it will be a win-win-win.

‚ûñ What happens if you are wrong?

This is not financial advice.

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Namaste.

Today, I‚Äôm excited to share the second part of my educational series on chart patterns.

In this post, we‚Äôll be focusing on the 'Head and Shoulders' and 'Inverse Head and Shoulders' patterns.

 For those who missed the first part, you can catch up here: 
  ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì


As always, I‚Äôve kept the explanations simple and beginner-friendly. I hope this guide provides you with valuable insights!

Here‚Äôs today‚Äôs outline:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Outline 

 1. What is the Head and Shoulders pattern? 
 
  Definition
  Key components
  Characteristics
 

 2. Head and Shoulders 
 
  Basic features
  Examples
 

 3. Inverse Head and Shoulders 
 
  Basic features
  Examples
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


 1. What is the "Head and Shoulders" pattern? 

 1) Definition 
 The Head and Shoulders pattern is a well-established reversal formation that appears after an uptrend and signals the potential start of a downtrend. It indicates that buying pressure is weakening and selling pressure is gaining momentum. 

 2) Key components 
 
 Left Shoulder:  The initial peak, where the price rises and then pulls back.
 Head : The highest peak, situated between the two shoulders, representing the final bullish push.
 Right Shoulder:  The third peak, which is typically lower than the head but similar to the left shoulder, signaling diminishing buying interest.
 Neckline:  A key support line drawn across the lows of the left and right shoulders. A decisive break below this neckline confirms the reversal and the beginning of a downtrend.
 
 3) Characteristics 
 
 Reversal signal:  The Head and Shoulders pattern marks a transition from an uptrend to a downtrend.
 Easy identification:  The structure is visually distinctive, with three clear peaks.
 Neckline significance:  A break below the neckline serves as a confirmation signal for the downtrend.
 Volume dynamics:  Volume typically rises during the formation of the left shoulder and head, decreases during the right shoulder, and surges again when the neckline is breached.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


 2. Head and Shoulders (Reversal from uptrend to downtrend) 

 1) Basic features 
 End of an uptrend:  The Head and Shoulders pattern forms at the end of a bullish phase, signaling a weakening in buying strength.
 Distinct peak heights:  The head is always higher than the shoulders, which are generally symmetrical, though the right shoulder may sometimes be slightly lower, enhancing the pattern‚Äôs reliability.
 Neckline as a trigger:  The neckline acts as a critical support level. A break below it confirms the pattern and signals the onset of a bearish trend.
 Volume confirmation:  Volume increases during the left shoulder and head formations, weakens during the right shoulder, and spikes when the neckline is broken, confirming a potential sell-off.
 Price target:  After the pattern completes, the expected price drop is typically equal to the distance between the head and the neckline, providing traders with a target.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 In this example, we see a fakeout at the right shoulder, followed by a sharp decline. 
 After a brief retest of the neckline, the price broke through and continued its downtrend.
 


 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this chart, a fakeout occurred when the price dropped from the head and formed the neckline, misleading many market participants. After forming the right shoulder, the price successfully declined. There were two retests, which confirmed the reliability of the pattern.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Reverse Head and Shoulders (Trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend) 

 1) Basic features 
 End of a downtrend:  The Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern typically forms at the end of a downtrend, signaling a potential reversal to the upside.
 Formation of lows:  Like the standard Head and Shoulders, this pattern consists of three lows‚Äîleft shoulder, head, and right shoulder‚Äîwith the head being the lowest point.
 Neckline significance:  The neckline is drawn across the highs of the left and right shoulders. A break above this line confirms the reversal and acts as a strong buy signal.
 Volume pattern:  Volume tends to decrease during the formation of the pattern but surges when the neckline is broken, signaling strong buying momentum.
 Target setting:  After the pattern is confirmed, the expected price rise is often equal to the distance from the head to the neckline, which helps traders set profit targets.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 After the Head and Shoulders pattern formed, the price broke above the neckline, successfully reversing the downtrend into an uptrend. A buy strategy would have yielded profits at the breakout point.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this example, a smaller Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern formed within the head of a larger pattern (see Example 3). After two successful retests, the price reversed into a strong uptrend.
 

 2-3) Example 3 

 
 This example showcases the smaller Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern mentioned in Example 2, located within the head. After two successful retests, a buy strategy could have led to profits as the price reversed into an uptrend.
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Conclusion 

 "Charts are the maps of the market." 

 The Head and Shoulders and Reverse Head and Shoulders patterns we‚Äôve covered in this post are key signals that frequently appear in the market. Charts aren‚Äôt random‚Äîthey are visual representations of market psychology and investor behavior. As traders, our role is to interpret these maps, navigate the market, and make informed decisions.

Investing is more than just buying and selling. Sometimes the market may move contrary to our expectations, while other times we seize opportunities and achieve success. Each experience is a chance to learn and grow. The more experience you gain, the more paths you‚Äôll recognize on the chart.

Success in this market requires persistence, patience, and continuous learning. Understanding and analyzing chart patterns like the ones discussed here is just the beginning. I hope this post has helped you gain a deeper understanding of the market and make more informed decisions.

The market is always evolving, but within that evolution lies opportunity. The key is developing the ability to spot those opportunities. With knowledge, experience, and confidence, you‚Äôll find greater success.

Stay prepared, and always listen to what the market is telling you.

Page 3, Article 16: Hello everyone!

Bitcoin is currently displaying the  '3 Market Phases,'  and we‚Äôre transitioning from Contraction into Expansion. As long as the price holds above the lower boundary of the horizontal channel, I believe there‚Äôs a strong likelihood of continued upward momentum.



 Key points: 
 
 Break below the channel:  A breakdown could signal the beginning of a significant downtrend. However, if the channel holds, the uptrend is expected to persist.
 Uptrend continuation:  There‚Äôs a solid chance we could see a rise toward the 63K level.
 

 
  This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
  It reflects a personal viewpoint and is intended for reference only.
  All decisions and responsibilities lie solely with you.
Page 3, Article 17: Bitcoin  has recently formed a bullish cup or U-shape pattern on the 1-hour time frame and has successfully broken above the flat top resistance.

Additionally, the RSI  is above 60 at the time of the breakout, providing further confirmation of the strength of the move.
An RSI above 60 indicates that the asset is in a strong bullish phase and that there is still momentum in the upward direction.

The depth of the Cup will be added to the breakout price and will act as a target price for this move.
Page 3, Article 18: By analyzing the #Bitcoin chart on the weekly timeframe, we can see that over the past two weeks, the price dropped from $65,000 to $52,500 and is currently trading around $54,400. If the price remains below $57,870, we will likely see further declines in Bitcoin. The potential targets for this drop are $50,750, $49,000, and $44,100. After a short corrective wave, we may witness a significant upward move in Bitcoin, with targets above $80,000.

Page 3, Article 21: 200EMA is still holding the ground where EMA is not letting the price through. 

Our gameplan here is simple: if we manage to hold this zone until the end of the zone, if we see a rejection happen in 36 hours, then we will see a good downward movement from here. 

But remember, fakeout option is still possible but only if buyers manage to breakout and secure the zone above EMAs.

Page 3, Article 22: BTC's price recently bounced from a strong support zone. A potential Bullish reversal seems in play as the price action has broken the previous Lower High. 

This is the 3rd Bounce from key Monthly Fibonacci levels since the previous massive Bull rally (along with further confluence from key Fibonacci Harmonic levels on the shorter 4HR time frame). 

Bounces from these critical levels may eventually lead to the completion of a massive Bullish flag/Cup & Handle Patterns on the Monthly time frames.

If price breaks the all time high and crosses 74000, the chances of TP2 will increase.

Although it is a short rise, the StochRSI indicator is already showing signs of entering the overbought zone.

Accordingly, the key is whether it can maintain the price above the MS-Signal indicator (M-Signal on the 1D chart) while receiving support near 56150.01-56950.56 and rising above 57889.10.

If not,
1st: 54730.0
2nd: 52137.67
You should check for support near the 1st and 2nd above.

Currently, since the M-Signal of the 1W chart > M-Signal of the 1D chart > M-Signal of the 1M chart, we need to check if it can lead to a movement to change the M-Signal of the 1D chart > M-Signal of the 1W chart.

Therefore, if it rises above 57889.10,
1st: 59053.55
2nd: 60672.0-61099.25
You can trade depending on whether there is support near the 1st and 2nd above.

The volatility period will begin soon.

As we pass around September 13 (September 12-14), we need to check in which direction it deviates from the 52137.617-61099.25 range and respond accordingly.



We are always at a crossroads.

I think we need to observe the flow of funds in the coin market to make a clearer choice at this crossroads.

It is not easy for individual investors to know the flow of funds.

We can only briefly understand the flow of funds due to stable coins such as USDT and USDC.

Currently, USDT is sideways, and USDC is gapping up, which is the driving force behind the coin market.

However, I think that USDT needs to gap up for the market to start a real uptrend.

Therefore, we need to think about how to increase the number of coins and tokens corresponding to profits while trading from a short-term perspective for the current uptrend.

Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after rising above 29K.

The section expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (when overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (when overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

Since I think it can create a new trend in the overshooting section, I need to check the movement when this section is touched.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to create a pull back pattern and start after rising to around 57014.33.

 Range-Bound Market:  Price is moving within a range, with resistance at $66,813.59 and support around $56,200-$54,650.

 Upside and Downside Hunting:  Failed breakout attempts suggest a potential liquidity grab; price may dip below the current range (downside hunting) before reversing.

 Key Levels:
Resistance: $66,813.59
Support: $56,200 - $54,650 

Outlook:  Short-term bearish with a potential reversal from lower support zones.  Watch for a breakout above the range.

Page 4, Article 11: Headline & Core Inflation 
13:30 (GMT) see's the release of the atest round of inflation data. The results here are pretty black and white high inflation (over 2.6% YOY for Inflation, over 3.2% for Core Inflation) is bad. End of. 

We need inflation t come down so we can cut the rates.

Heres where any predictions get a bit tricky though. Very good inflation data 2% like 2% or under could mean we get a big rate cut (50bps is a 33% chance atm). That would send the market wild. Coming in at 2.6% / 2.5% will give us a 25bps rate cut - which is bullish but might be priced in to some degree.

 Either way, low inflation good. High infation bad. 
 
Inflation Rate (YOY) 
Predicted = 2.6% Priced In
 <2.6% = Bullish 
>2.6% = Bearish

 Core Inflation Rate (YOY) - Inflation data not including food and fuel. 
Predicted = 3.2% Priced In
<3.2% = Bullish
>3.2% = Bearish

 Technicals 
In terms of the charts I'd say thats an ascending triangle.

Nice little series of higher lows being capped by flat resistance at $57.5k.

Usually a bullish set up, but realistically thats not going to mean alot if inflation is 9%.

 Trading Plan 
What we can say though is that the overhead resistance starting at $57.5 is basically toast if we get a good inflation read so If we get a good read go long.

Targets are not clear but after the immediate cluster theres an old support/resistance at $63.7k so maybe target $60k ($59.9k to be safe) and $63.7k incase we blow through it.

Bad inflation = short. It could be bad but still take incramental profit to be safe at support, so $53.5k, $50k and maybe hold a bit back as we could easily sink much lower.

 Prediction  - 2.6% price pumps to $60k area (I hope!)
Page 4, Article 12: In less than six months, you will see Bitcoin at $38,000 and $35,000, and you will see $70,000 in two years.
You are already seeing this
Page 4, Article 13: Bitcoin is suffering in the daily time frame and it can fall down sharply and reach the limit of 40-48. In the meantime, the dominance of Bitcoin is also falling, which is a sign of stagnation in the altcoin market. Please note that In this case, don't go to them when the coins are pumped because it will be an excuse for your liquidation. The best time to buy bitcoin and altcoins is between 40-48
Page 4, Article 14: Bitcoin will return to 70K in Q4! Maybe even higher!

Technical analysis
Significant resistance at 59.500 has been breached. Is crucial for Bitcoin to gain further upward momentum,Since breaking this area similarly signals a strong bullish trend, this could push Bitcoin to 62500, which corresponds to another stronger area of 65000, again this gives us confidence to return to 70,000!

Continued interest from the same institutional investors could provide the necessary capital inflows to push Bitcoin above these resistance levels.
Positive regulatory developments can boost market confidence and help Bitcoin rise.
Global economic conditions, including inflation rates and monetary policy, will also play an important role in Bitcoin's price trajectory.

Hello, traders.

Have a good day today.

-------------------------------------

When you start studying charts, the first thing you learn is about candles.

However, you start studying about the Open, Close, High, and Low of candles.

When you start studying about the Moving Average, you start to think that you understand the charts.

However, when you actually start trading with the Moving Average, you realize that nothing works properly.

So, you start studying other indicators.

-
The above is based on my experience. When you study various charts, you may think you know them, but when you actually start trading, you realize that they don't apply at all.

Where on earth did I go wrong?... What I learned after a long time is that I was wrong from the very beginning.

-
In other words, I realized that my subsequent chart studies were not done properly because I lacked understanding of candles.

When you start studying candles, you study candles of various shapes and patterns.

At this time, you should not be too obsessed with the names of candle shapes or patterns or the conditions that occur and try to memorize them.

It is important to read it repeatedly several times until you can grasp the concept of the arrangements formed by the combination of candle shapes or patterns, that is, the support and resistance points.

Eventually, when the candle shapes or patterns are combined, you can find the volume profile section formed around it, that is, the section where trading volume occurs.

By drawing and marking the support and resistance points you find in this way on 1M, 1W, and 1D charts, you can create a trading strategy on the charts you mainly trade.

That's all the experts in chart analysis say.

In the end, everything is about looking at the combination of candles that make up the chart, finding the corresponding support and resistance points, and trading according to your trading strategy.

A trading strategy is to create a response strategy at the corresponding support and resistance points based on the three things above:
1. Investment period
2. Investment size
3. Trading method and profit realization method

However, since most books do not include trading strategies, you will only learn about the timing of trading and closing of trading using various indicators.

Because of this, there are many cases where you cannot respond to the volatility that occurs after starting trading and end up losing money.

Even so, it is difficult to specifically define the contents of trading strategies.

This is because the investment period, investment size, and trading method are different depending on the individual's investment style.

Therefore, what I can tell you is that you need to set the buy, sell, and stop loss points according to the support and resistance points obtained through chart analysis and wait for a while.

Due to price volatility, you may not touch the buy, sell, and stop loss points or may move past them.

You should learn how to create a trading strategy by modifying the way you respond to these things according to your investment style.

-
One important thing here is that you should mark the support and resistance points in advance through chart analysis before starting trading.

Otherwise, if you start trading and then mark support and resistance points, psychological factors will come into play, which will likely lead to an unexpected transaction.

Don't forget this, and you should practice marking support and resistance points in advance before starting a transaction.

Also, you should avoid analyzing charts after listening to various articles, news, or community content.

The reason is that psychological factors can come into play.

-
I think trading is a response to the movement of prices that fluctuate in real time.

Therefore, waiting and determination are necessary.

If you wait too long or do not make a decision and pass it by, there is a high possibility that you will suffer losses or make little profit, so you need something to refer to when waiting or making a decision.

That is the support and resistance points I mentioned above.

-
However, support and resistance points alone do not solve everything.

Therefore, you should add trend lines and various indicators to ask for a method of responding to price fluctuations.

However, since the trend line is formed by a diagonal line, there is a lack of countermeasure strategies using the trend line.

Therefore, the trend line is used to literally find out what the current trend is.

-
Therefore, when it deviates from the trend line, the movement at the support and resistance points is checked and the corresponding response is made.

When trading with a chart consisting of the above two support and resistance points or only the trend line, there are often cases where the transaction cannot be properly conducted due to fakes or sweeps.

Therefore, in order to counter these fakes or sweeps, various indicators are added to the chart.

The most commonly used of these is the price moving average.

Even if you add the price moving average, you realize that it is a curve, just like the trend line, and is therefore not suitable for countermeasure strategies.

So, the price moving average is also used to check the trend, just like the trend line.

-
In that regard, the indicator I recommend is the StochRSI indicator.

The default settings for the StochRSI indicator are 14, 7, 3, 3 (RSI, Stoch, K, D).

The value of the Signal line (EMA) of the StochRSI indicator is 7.

If the StochRSI indicator rises in the oversold zone and maintains the state of StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, it is a buying period.

On the other hand, if the StochRSI indicator falls in the overbought zone and maintains the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, it is a selling period.

However, you should trade depending on whether there is support or resistance at the support and resistance points formed at that location.

Even if there is movement in the StochRSI indicator, it is recommended not to trade if you do not have support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

The reason is that you may feel psychologically anxious, so there is a possibility that the trade will proceed incorrectly.

-
If you can trade with only what I mentioned above and make an average profit, it is because you have established a trading strategy according to your investment style.

-
We need objective information to establish a trading strategy according to your investment style.

We think that this is the only way to minimize the psychological factors that arise when starting a trade.

If you can add various indicators to the chart to obtain objective information and receive support and resistance point information according to them, you can create a trading strategy according to them at any time.

To do this, we used the StochRSI, OBV, CCI, and RSI indicators to display support and resistance points on the price candle part.

And, we added the StochRSI and BW indicators as auxiliary indicators.

The StochRSI indicator added as an auxiliary indicator is not the StochRSI indicator provided by default, but an indicator with a modified formula, so you can share the chart and use it or copy and paste the TS-BW UP indicator to your own chart and use it.

There is no problem using the basic StochRSI indicator.

However, there is a slight difference from what I said, so there may be a slight problem in understanding.

-
As above, since the support and resistance points of the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts are drawn on the chart to create a trading strategy, my chart is very confusing and not easy to understand when you first look at it.


And, since there are many indicators that I have not explained, it may be even more difficult to see the chart.

Therefore, to resolve the difficult parts, share the chart, hide the indicators added to the chart, and activate them one by one while looking at them, and you will be able to understand the chart.

If you share the chart, you can use it normally, so you can check the chart from various angles.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

Page 4, Article 19: üåüMy analysis is that the future of #Bitcoin looks very exciting. Several big analysts and experts are working on this issue, and each of them says something different. Some, like Peter Brandt, think #Bitcoin might go down a little more, but others like Axel Adler are hopeful that its price will go up a lot.

üåüOn the other hand, big companies like MicroStrategy are buying #Bitcoin. This means that experienced and wealthy people think Bitcoin has a good future. The way Erik Voorhees and Max Keiser see it, Bitcoin can be a good alternative to the dollar and its value can increase significantly.

üåüBut there are also some things to pay attention to. For example, the Relative Strength Index of #Bitcoin shows that its price may rise very quickly and then fall suddenly. This means that the #Bitcoin market is still very volatile and we need to be careful.

üëÄLet's take a look at the chart and see what it tells usüëáüëá

üíéDaily #Bitcoin Analysis

ü§ØYesterday's surge (September 13th) propelled #Bitcoin above its most significant resistance level at 57,877.90. This breakthrough significantly enhances the likelihood of further bullish momentumüöÄüöÄüöÄ

üéØ‚úÖHaving breached this resistance, #Bitcoin is poised to extend its rally within its expanded structure, targeting:

üöÄTarget 1: 62,577.59-63,002.85
üöÄüöÄTarget 2: 66,755.85
üöÄüöÄüöÄTarget 3: 74,537.70
üëâPlease note that these targets are precise, not approximate

‚ùåStop-Loss for the Bullish Scenario and Potential Temporary Dip:

üî¥If the 57,877.90 support level is breached on the daily timeframe before reaching the subsequent bull-targets, #Bitcoin may enter a temporary bearish phase, potentially retesting the following support levels:

üîª51,676.75-52,489.40
üîªüîª48,483.55-50,096.10
üíéüöÄThese support levels are sufficiently robust to potentially reinitiate an bull-trend.

‚ùå‚ùåHowever, if a weekly candle closes below 49,000 due to a bearish move, #Bitcoin could enter a deeper and more prolonged bearish phase. In such a scenario, a long-term analysis update will be providedüîÑ

..................................
üíé#Bitcoin Analysis: ‚è±1-Hour Timeframe

üìàüìâTo encapsulate #Bitcoin's recent bullish momentum within a structured framework, we can overlay both a smaller and a larger bullish channel (refer to the attached chart).

üöÄThese channels serve as guiding lines for the bull-trend, providing a solid foundation for crafting growth scenariosüëá

‚úÖ‚úÖStrong Growth Scenario: As long as #Bitcoin remains confined within the smaller (more recent) bullish channel, there is a high probability of continued bullish movement with strong momentum.

üöÄThe support levels within this channel act as potential launchpads for renewed growth toward our primary price targets. These support levels include: the mid-line of this channel, the mid-line of the larger bullish channel, the daily support level at 59585.21, and the channel's lower boundary!!

‚úÖModerate Growth Scenario: A breakout below the smaller channel could lead to a retest of the larger channel's low. This low, which aligns with the static support range of 57877.90-58545.41, represents a second and final opportunity to halt the decline and initiate a new upward leg toward our price targets!!

üîªBearish Scenario: A breakout below the larger channel on the 4-hour timeframe, coupled with the activation of our daily stop-loss, would signal a temporary bearish phase.

Page 4, Article 21: Based on the analysis of price action and the identified supply and demand zones, BTC/USDT appears to be at a critical juncture with the 50% retracement level acting as a significant resistance. If the price fails to break through this level and encounters selling pressure, a fall towards lower levels is plausible. It is crucial for traders to keep an eye on the behavior around the lower demand zones to gauge the strength of the potential reversal or continuation of the downward trend.

These equities typically include crypto mining firms, blockchain infrastructure providers, and companies with significant holdings in digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. As the broader cryptocurrency market experiences volatility, these stocks tend to exhibit similar price fluctuations, presenting both opportunities and risks. When comparing these equities, it's essential to consider factors such as their correlation to cryptocurrency prices, regulatory impacts, and the underlying company's financial health and growth potential. The industry continues to evolve rapidly, providing dynamic investment opportunities aligned with the future of digital finance.
Page 5, Article 6: **Trade Setup for BTC/USDT (1D, Binance)**

- **Trade Type:** Short  
- **Entry Zone:** $60,300 - $65,300 (Supply Zone)  
- **Target:** $41,860 (Liquidity Area)  
- **Stop Loss:** Above $65,300

**Rationale:**  
- The price is approaching a key supply zone where a reversal due to selling pressure is expected.  
- Price action is in a bearish structure, with the potential to make a lower low targeting the liquidity area below $42,000.  
- There‚Äôs a liquidity pool at $41,860, which could be the final target after trapping long positions.  
- Stop-loss is placed above the supply zone to limit risk in case the price breaks higher.
Page 5, Article 7: Bitcoin took a significant hit yesterday, dropping past our initial target zone and finding support at the secondary zone outlined in Plan B.

The purpose of our plan is to identify key levels or zones that serve as strong areas for potential trades. If the Plan B level continues to hold, the price may form a potential leading diagonal, creating a wave structure from 1-5 as highlighted on the chart.

This scenario could push BTC's next target back to the 66k-68k range. This setup allows us to use a tight stop loss just below 56k.
 
It's a volatile market, so we should be prepared for any outcome. Trade safely.
Page 5, Article 8: Hi guys, this is my overview for BTCUSDT, feel free to check it and write your feedback in commentsüëä

A few moments ago price entered to rising channel, where it reached $61800 level, broke it, and continued to move up.

Price reached resistance line, then it turned around and started to decline and soon exited from channel.

Next, price continued to decline in wedge, where it declined lower than $61800 and $55700 levels, breaking its.

Then BTC reached support line of wedge and then started to grow inside another rising channel.

In this channel, price broke $55700 level and at the moment it trades near resistance line of channel.

Possible, BTC can reach resistance line of channel and then start to decline to $55500

If this post is useful to you, you can support me with like/boost and advice in comments‚ù§Ô∏è
Page 5, Article 9: Bitcoin has reached again the line of 100EMA, where historically we have had pretty good rejections. 

We are looking to get another rejection from here and a possible further downward movement toward $50K. 

But if somehow we break the EMAs, then there is a chance to see another fakeout form. 

Swallow Team
Page 5, Article 10: Not much has changed here for Bitcoin, even though we did get a decent move up yesterday back into the range.

What ‚Äúmay‚Äù be important is that Bitcoin has potentially put in it‚Äôs first higher low since the all time high. As you can see, we have had bearish market structure - a series of lower highs and lower lows. This higher low would be conrirmed by a break above $65,000 - the last lower high.
Page 5, Article 11: Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price rose to resistance 2, which coincided with the resistance zone and broke this level. Then it rose a little higher than the resistance zone and some time traded near until it reached the trend line and then BTC started to decline. In a short time price declined to resistance 1, which coincided with one more resistance zone, breaking resistance 2. As well, the price started to trades inside the wedge, where it rebounded from resistance 1 and tried to grow, but failed and soon dropped back. Some time later BTC fell to the resistance zone and at once rebounded to the trend line, which is the resistance line of the wedge also, and then declined to the support line of the wedge, breaking resistance 1. Recently price bounced up to this level and tried to break it, but failed and now trades below. In my mind, BTCUSDT will make a small movement up and then continue to decline to support line of the wedge. Therefore I set my goal at 54800 points.

I expect the sceond stage distribution has been completed on the weekend or at least until Tuesday. So here is the chart for the idea :
Page 5, Article 13: it is the result of price pattern reading, various indicators and many other pyramids.

It is possible that the rise in the white box will be deleted maximally.
The last drop is not a mini abc, which gives the probability that it will drop below 49k.
More information in the updates that may say this is a potential truth.

This is just an analysis of different results *and may be wrong*.

Page 5, Article 14: BTC Update:

Bitcoin is moving as expected. Yesterday, it made a sudden drop but quickly recovered. The current price of $58.1k needs to move strongly to continue the rally.

The RSI continues to gain bullish momentum and still has room to grow.

The target of  FWB:67K -$68k remains unchanged.

I'll provide updates on the altcoins shortly, so stay tuned. If you have any requests for specific altcoins, let me know in the comments or via DM.

- According to the  latest analysis presented , Bitcoin made a correction based on the predicted path to the second green box area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe $50,000 correction range.

- In the recent modification, a double zigzag has been formed. The second zigzag is a flat correction.

 According to the formation of an ascending diamond pattern in the green box area, after the failure of the dynamic trigger, the diamond pattern will be confirmed and it can expect to climb up to the specified areas according to the previous analysis.

Page 5, Article 16: BTC is set for another down trend . watch closely for better sell opportunity if all confirmations hold
Page 5, Article 17: Analyzing the Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) 4-hour chart gives a clear view of the market's recent activities and provides insight into potential future movements:

Overview of Current Market Conditions:

Bitcoin is currently trading around $56,590, following a significant downtrend from its recent highs. This movement has positioned Bitcoin just above a major support level at $54,319.86 (S1), which is critical to watch in the short term.
Support and Resistance Levels:

Immediate resistance is identified at $58,672.95 (R1). This level could act as a short-term barrier for any upward movements. Further resistance is seen at $65,731.15 (R2) and $70,387.98 (R3), which align with previous price consolidation zones and peaks.
Key support levels are $54,319.86 (S1) and a more substantial base at $48,745.21 (S2). These levels could potentially hold further price declines if the current support fails.
Technical Indicators:

The MACD is currently below the signal line and hovering near zero, indicating a weak momentum and a bearish market stance. This suggests that there might be continued downward pressure or consolidation in the near term.
The RSI is at 43.44, which is neither in the oversold nor overbought territory. However, it leans towards a bearish sentiment, aligning with the MACD's indications.
Trading Strategy:

Given Bitcoin's proximity to the $54,319.86 support level (S1), my immediate strategy would be to monitor this level closely. A bounce off this support with increased volume could signal a potential buying opportunity, targeting the first resistance at $58,672.95 (R1). Conversely, a break below this support could see Bitcoin testing the next major support at $48,745.21 (S2), presenting a short position opportunity.
Entering a trade, I would place a stop-loss just below $54,000 for long positions, to mitigate risk in case of a sudden downturn. For short positions, a stop just above $54,500 after confirming a breakdown would be prudent.
Risk Management:

Considering the volatile nature of Bitcoin, maintaining a strict risk management strategy is crucial. Adjusting stop-loss levels to break-even when prices move favorably can protect gains and reduce potential losses.
Regularly reviewing upcoming economic events and news that may affect market sentiment is also vital, as crypto markets can be highly responsive to such stimuli.
Overall, this analysis aims to leverage technical insights to capitalize on Bitcoin's price movements, balancing between cautious observation and readiness to act on clear market signals.

I like to avoid very bright or jarring colors on my charts. I also avoid red as much as possible because it's not ideal for keeping a calm collected mind required for trading (IMO). 

I went for a cool modern look with complimentary oranges and steel blues.

Page 5, Article 20: Hello, this is full-time trader full_time_trader88.

Here‚Äôs the Bitcoin market analysis for September 10.

Let‚Äôs dive right in.




 (Ascending Channel Perspective)

üî¥ Ascending Channel 1 

This is the first short-term ascending channel (pink).
 Bitcoin has broken out to the upside and even completed a support retest.

The price was already trending upwards within the channel, but this breakout further solidifies the bullish outlook.

 üîµ Ascending Channel 2 

This is another smaller ascending channel, which has also broken to the upside‚Äîanother positive indicator.

As long as these ascending channels hold, the overall trend remains bullish.





 (Descending Channel Perspective)

üü† Descending Channel 

This descending channel had been in place for about a week. After breaking down through the lower boundary, Bitcoin has rebounded and is now testing the upper resistance.

Currently, it‚Äôs facing resistance for the third time.
A breakout from this channel would be a significant move.




 (Both Channels Together) 

Here‚Äôs what the combined view of both the ascending and descending channels looks like.





 (Bollinger Bands Perspective)

üî¥ Lower Bollinger Band Break 

Recently, the candles broke below the lower Bollinger Band.

Historically, when this occurs, the price tends to rebound towards the middle band, and it has done so recently.

Given this pattern, we can expect a potential rise to the middle Bollinger Band,
currently sitting at $58.9K.





 (Angle Perspective)

üîµ Gradual Decline Followed by a Steep Drop 

If you observe recent downtrends, they tend to begin with a gradual decline before accelerating sharply, which often marks the bottom.

The early September drop follows a similar pattern, suggesting we may be in a potential bottoming area.

In such cases, Bitcoin has historically rebounded beyond the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. For the recent drop, this would take us above $60K, indicating a possible short-term rally to that level‚Äîan encouraging signal.

(Of course, no chart pattern guarantees certainty.)





 (Symmetrical Triangle Perspective)

üü£ Mid-sized Symmetrical Triangle 

This is a mid-sized symmetrical triangle spanning 43 days.

As it hasn‚Äôt broken out yet, it could potentially extend to a 50‚Äì60 day consolidation period.

This is one of the largest symmetrical triangles we‚Äôve seen this year.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Volume 

The volume within the triangle is inconsistent, making the pattern less reliable.
However, due to its size, I‚Äôm watching it closely.





 (Large Descending Channel Perspective)

üü¢ Large Descending Channel 

This large descending channel has been in place for about six months, dating back to March 2024.

Bitcoin has stayed within this channel throughout, with every candle contained inside. It‚Äôs quite a persistent structure.

The recent bottom coincided with a bounce off the lower boundary of this channel, making it a key support level.

(Previous attempts to break below were unsuccessful, as the daily close remained inside the channel. The daily close is, therefore, an important indicator.)






 (Major Support Zone Perspective)

üü£ Consolidation Before a Major Rally 

Historically, Bitcoin consolidated for around 10 days before a 50% rally.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Major Support Zone (50.5‚Äì53.0K) 

I‚Äôve highlighted a rectangular box at this consolidation area, which now serves as a major support zone.

This area has provided key support during Bitcoin‚Äôs lows in July, August, and September.

I view the 50.5K‚Äì53.0K range as a critical support zone.





 (Combined View of Symmetrical Triangle + Large Descending Channel + Major Support Zone) 

Here‚Äôs what the chart looks like when we combine these elements.






 (CPI Schedule)

‚ö™Ô∏è CPI (Consumer Price Index) 

The CPI data will be released on September 11 at 8:30 AM.

It‚Äôs essential to observe whether this data impacts the crypto market. 

Historically, CPI releases have had a significant influence on crypto prices, so be cautious as we may see increased volatility during this period.

-


 

1. The uptrend is still intact.

2. The outcome of the mid-sized symmetrical triangle and large descending channel will be pivotal.

3. Be prepared for potential volatility during tomorrow‚Äôs CPI release.


This is a simple summary of my thoughts. 

Please use it as a reference, and I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your follow and like.

Thank you!

 Volume Momentum Using MACD: This indicator calculates the MACD based on smoothed volume changes. By using the difference between two moving averages of volume (short-term subtracted from long-term), it highlights significant shifts in volume momentum, which are essential for confirming trend strength and sustainability.
 Fractal Analysis: Fractals are used to identify natural repetition patterns in price movements around significant highs and lows. This indicator employs multiple fractal lengths to capture a comprehensive picture of market structure and pivot points, enhancing the detection of potential trend reversals or continuations.
 Trend Confirmation: By combining the insights from volume momentum and fractal analysis, this tool filters out false signals and provides a more reliable confirmation of the underlying market trend.
 
 
 How It Works 
 
 The MACD of volume highlights shifts in market momentum, with a focus on how recent volume compares to historical norms.
 Fractals delineate critical points in the price structure, offering visual cues about potential turning points based on historical price action.
 The indicator synthesizes these elements to paint a clear picture of potential trend developments, signaling green when both volume momentum and fractal proximity suggest a bullish trend, and red when they indicate bearish conditions.

Page 5, Article 23: Hello everyone,

Here‚Äôs a quick and simple breakdown of the key support and resistance zones.
Below are the reasons why these zones have been selected:

 ‚úîÔ∏è Support Zone 1. ($53,329.5 ~ $52,372.5) 

 
 Descending channel
 Fibonacci 0.786 retracement
 Significant low (S/R Flip)
 


 ‚úîÔ∏è Resistance Zone 1. ($55,969.0 ~ $55,499.6) 

 
 Fibonacci 0.236 retracement
 Significant low (S/R Flip)
 


 ‚úîÔ∏è Resistance Zone 2. ($58,218.0 ~ $57,348.7) 

 
 Fibonacci 0.382 retracement
 Significant low (S/R Flip)
 

There's a strong likelihood of significant price action within these zones, either as support or resistance. Keep a close eye on Bitcoin‚Äôs movement in these areas. Best of luck!

Page 6, Article 1: üÜïIt's certainly concerning to see BlackRock, a financial giant, experience its first outflow from its Bitcoin Trust. This could indeed exert downward pressure on Bitcoin's price, especially in the short term, as it may signal a shift in sentiment among institutional investors.

‚≠êHowever, it's important to consider the broader context. While BlackRock's outflow is notable, other major asset managers are still seeing inflows. Furthermore, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond short-term capital flows.

‚≠êFor instance, developments like the partnership between Merlin Chain and BitcoinOS, aimed at improving network scalability and efficiency, could significantly bolster Bitcoin's long-term prospects. Such advancements have the potential to drive increased demand and adoption.

‚úÖUltimately, while short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, it's crucial to maintain a long-term perspective. Technical analysis, combined with a deep understanding of fundamental factors, can provide valuable insights into Bitcoin's future price movements. The market will ultimately decide, and it's wise to stay informed and adapt to evolving market dynamics

üíéDaily #Bitcoin Analysis
üöÄIn our previous analysis, we predicted a bullish move from the weekly timeframe channel's bottom, which successfully occurred, reaching our initial target of 57877.90‚úÖü§ë

‚ö†Ô∏èAs previously mentioned, this target represents a significant resistance level (daily timeframe pivot: monthly resistance)‚ùóÔ∏è

‚úÖContinuation of the bullish-Trend Scenario:
If the 57877.90 resistance is breached on the daily time-frame, we anticipate further growth towards targets of 63002.85, 66755.85, and ultimately 74537.70üöÄ

‚úÖLower Price Entry Scenario:
Given the strong resistance at the monthly level, a pullback is possible before a breakout.
However, if a correction occurs, we remain bullish and expect #Bitcoin to find support at one of the following levelsüëá
55743.20 (weekly support), 51676.75-52489.40, or 48483.55-50096.10, from which it can resume its upward trajectory towards the aforementioned targets

‚ùåStop-Loss for the Bullish Scenario: Our bullish view would only be invalidated if a weekly candle closes below 49000.00üîªüîª
üîÑIn such a case, we will provide an updated analysisüßê

...............................
üíé#Bitcoin Analysis: ‚è±4-Hour Timeframe

üìåBased on the price touching the daily pivot point (monthly resistance) and the subsequent temporary weakness:

üëâIf the price breaks down on the 4-hour timeframe due to this contact and reaches the support zone of 55059.97 - 55743.20:
üí∞We can use the formation of a head and shoulders pattern to determine the subsequent direction of movement on this timeframe.

‚úÖbullish scenario: If the price reaches the mentioned support zone, bounces, and breaks above the neck-line of the head and shoulders pattern, it confirms a continuation of the uptrend from this area.

‚úÖtemporary bearish scenario: If the 4-hour timeframe breaks below the head and shoulders pattern, it indicates a continuation of the bear-trend towards the second and third support levels of the main analysis. The price is expected to attempt to form a bottom at one of these support levels.


üíé4-Hour Timeframe Analysis(
‚ùóÔ∏èThere is also a possibility of a temporary rally to the resistance zone of 58556.01 - 58936.40, followed by a decline to the support zone of 55059.97 - 55743.20.

‚úÖIn this scenario, the head and shoulders pattern should be drawn with a positive slope, and we would wait for a breakout below the lower boundry or above the upper boundry to signal a temporary decline or a continuation of the growth.

‚ùåThis scenario remains valid until a significant breakout above the monthly #Bitcoin resistance occurs, which would confirm the continuation of the bull-trend from this level on the daily timeframe.
Page 6, Article 2: TL;DR for Busy Readers

 
 95% confidence that Bitcoin has bottomed at $52.5k, with the worst possible scenario at $50.4k.
 The USDT Dominance Chart is showing resistance levels not seen since the last bear market when Bitcoin was around $27k.
 For Bitcoin to hit $44k, USDT dominance would need to enter bear market territory, which is highly unlikely.
 A 30%+ downside move in USDT dominance suggests more capital will flow into Bitcoin, signaling a bullish uptrend.
 The odds are heavily in favor of Bitcoin moving upward from here, and I expect it to play out over the rest of the month.
 

I‚Äôm 95% confident that we‚Äôve bottomed out at $52.5k, and the worst case scenario would be $50.4k. Additionally, I‚Äôm 95% certain we won‚Äôt see a drop to $44k or anywhere near it. Here‚Äôs why.

 The USDT Dominance Chart: A Key Indicator 
One of the most reliable charts for predicting Bitcoin tops and market reversals is the USDT Dominance chart. This chart tracks the dominance of Tether (USDT) in the market, and right now, it‚Äôs showing levels not seen since the last bear market when Bitcoin was trading around $27k.

Currently, USDT Dominance is at critical resistance, touching levels that are typically only observed during bear markets. Historically, when USDT dominance hits these levels, it signals a bottom for Bitcoin and the beginning of an uptrend.

Additionally, the USDT dominance chart indicates we could see over a 30%+ move to the downside in USDT dominance, meaning more capital will flow out of stablecoins and back into Bitcoin and other cryptos. This is a strong indicator that Bitcoin is bottoming out and preparing for a bullish move.

 Why $44k is Unlikely 
For Bitcoin to drop to $44k, USDT dominance would have to enter territory that we‚Äôve only ever seen in true bear markets. If this happens, it could break the higher timeframe (HTF) structure on both the USDT dominance chart and the Bitcoin chart, and ultimately, we wouldn‚Äôt just stop at $44k‚Äîwe‚Äôd probably end up around $30k.

 That‚Äôs why if you‚Äôre hoping for $44k , you‚Äôre really wishing for a major bear market that could pull Bitcoin down much further. This scenario would mean a shift in the current market structure, which doesn‚Äôt align with the probabilities we‚Äôre seeing.

 Upside Probability is Much Higher 
While there‚Äôs always a chance that USDT dominance could break higher and push the market lower, the probability of this happening is very small in my opinion. Investing is all about probabilities, and when we assess the entire market situation, it‚Äôs clear that the upside is heavily favored right now.

Based on the data, the market structure, and the USDT dominance chart, the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing upward from here is very high. It‚Äôs important to monitor how the market behaves in the coming weeks, but all signs point toward a bullish move.

 My years of experience kind of Opinion 
In summary, the USDT dominance chart is signaling that we‚Äôve likely seen the bottom at $52.5k, and the chances of Bitcoin falling to $44k or lower are extremely slim. If anything, this level of USDT dominance typically indicates that a Bitcoin rally is on the horizon. Stay cautious, but it looks like the market is gearing up for an uptrend. Let's see how the rest of the month plays out, but from where I stand, the upside looks very promising.
 
DISCLAIMER: 
All though I predicted the market at 18K pump, this prediction is still for informational/documentation of my journey and entertainment purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. As with all investments, there are risks involved, and probability-based analysis may not always result in accurate predictions. Always consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

-------------------------------------



I think funds are still flowing into the coin market.

Therefore, as long as funds flow into the coin market, the coin market is expected to continue its upward trend.


However, I think that it is necessary to adjust the investment ratio because the trading volume is not the same as before (box section).

-----------------------------------------------

(1D chart)

The horizontal line drawn on the chart indicates the volume profile section.

Therefore, the strongest volume profile section at the current price position is around 58697.01.

In addition, the volume profile section currently being formed is 56843.36, 64179.08.

The PVT indicator is a component of the BW indicator.

Since the PVT is currently in a downward trend, we can see that the downward strength is strong.

Therefore, when it rises above 58697.01, it is important to see whether the PVT turns into an upward trend.

-
(1D chart)

If it receives support near 57889.10, it is highly likely that the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator will turn upward.

Therefore, the key is whether it can receive support near 57889.10 and rise above 59053.55.

However, since the current StochRSI indicator is in the overbought zone and has a change in slope, there is a possibility that it will make a short-term high near 57889.10.

If the StochRSI indicator turns downward this time, whether it will receive support near 56150.01-56950.56 is an important key.

-
(1W chart)

If PVT falls below the dotted line on the 1W chart, there is a high possibility that it will turn into a downtrend.

Therefore, you should check whether it can be supported near 57122.77, which is the lower point of the HA-High indicator box on the 1W chart.

--------------------------------------------

Since the trading period is mostly different, the chart analysis will differ depending on which point you start trading from.

Therefore, the points or sections I mentioned are points or sections that can affect the trend.

I think the point that has the greatest influence on the trend change from the current price position is the 57889.10 point.

In order for the trend change to expand, it must break out of the 56150.01-59053.55 section.

-
From a short-term perspective, it seems that it is currently forming a short-term high.

So, to break above this short term high, it needs to be supported above 59053.55.

-
Have a nice time.

Thank you.

Page 6, Article 6: By examining the trend in the one-hour time frame, Bitcoin has a resistance range of the ascending channel ceiling in the range of $60,625 and now, provided it is maintained, the price can decrease to the support range of the channel floor in the range of 57,632-57,243.

From our weekly chart diagram above, you can observe that the black bear cells has faded and the white dot (longs) has literally escaped the shorts prison cell (black cell). This signal has never  missed since the 15k BTC season. The batting average of this one playing out again is very very high.

Key Points:

Recovery: Bitcoin closed above $57,273.
Previous Drop: A 3.5% decline created market uncertainty.
Next Resistance: $60,863.

Welcome to this BTC update. BTC is trading inside a broadening wedge pattern in the daily time frame and currently hovering near the lower trendline of the wedge. 

Every time the price tested the lower trendline, it formed a new lower low but, the first time, it made a Lower high, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. This could signal the end of the downtrend and the beginning of a new uptrend.

A potential bullish outcome includes a new all-time high by the end of the year.

Invalidation: Daily close below the previous lower low. 

What are your thoughts on BTC's current price action? Share your analysis in the comments!
Page 6, Article 16: BTCUSDT continues its downward trend, with a noticeable lack of buying pressure since late August. The price action has been characterized by consistent lower lows and lower closes. Even on the daily chart, we see this pattern persisting, despite a recent false breakout below the July low, with the price hovering near that level again. Historically, September tends to be a difficult month for Bitcoin, often resulting in negative performance. This pattern suggests that the price could drop further, potentially breaking below the 50,000 mark and aiming for the support zone between 48,000 and 45,000. If the price reaches this zone, a strong rebound could occur, potentially sparking a new bullish trend. The target is the support level at 51,220.00

üß†From a structural point of view, the double bottom bullish structure constructed near the buying zone has all the target zones achieved, so we need to be alert to the risk of a pullback.

‚û°Ô∏èFrom a wave theory perspective, if we start the Elliott Pulse Wave from here, then we can expect wave 5 to occur

‚û°Ô∏èSo, if you are involved in some long transactions, you can lock in the main profits and look forward to more. Unfortunately, yesterday's pullback did not touch our entry price, so we can only wait patiently for the next opportunity to come.

Page 6, Article 18: Elliot Wave Theory is an absolute favorite of mine, combined with Wyckoff Method and chart analysis (trendlines and technical indicators). If you've been following; you'll know I've been speaking of a multi-month cycle, specifically a multi month corrective wave before the final impulse wave up (4-5).

Considering we're still in that corrective phase, let's take a look at TWO options from here:

 Option 1 , is we retrace around -50%, same as last time. However, this would pose an issue - if we drop lower than (1), it invalidates the Elliot Wave Theory, and also invalidates the bullish cycle. The second problem, is that the previous cycle's increase (2-3) was MUCH bigger than the current 2-3 we are observing. This brings us to option 2.


 Option 2 , is that we retrace around the same ratio as the previous cycle. To calculate the ration, we need to see what % we retraced and compare it to the % increase. 
We increased 1533.92% (2-3)and retraced 55.25% (3-4). That means it's a 3.6% correction compared to the increase.
For the current cycle, we increased 357.27% (2-3) and retraced 33.76% (3-4). This gives us a 9,45% correction - three times as much as the previous cycle.


You can take this two ways -  either we're following a 50% correction, OR we're not falling lower than the current point 4 which is around $49K.

Page 6, Article 19: #BTC: No Major Changes Yet..!! Bitcoin has been consolidating within a Descending Broadening Wedge for the past six months. Breaking through the critical $69-70k resistance level is essential for the bulls to regain control. Despite multiple failed attempts, there is renewed optimism that this time could be different, as the resistance is showing signs of weakening.

A successful breakout above the Descending Broadening Wedge could propel Bitcoin towards the $100k mark in Q4. However, for now, leverage trading might not be the best approach. If you‚Äôre holding Bitcoin, it‚Äôs time to sit back and relax‚Äîthe next bull run could be just around the corner.

#Crypto #DYRO
Page 6, Article 20: Current Position: Bitcoin is trading around $58,227, moving within a descending trendline pattern but showing signs of upward momentum as it nears a key horizontal resistance zone between $60,000 and $65,000.

 The major resistance zone is the brown-shaded area between $60,000 and $65,000. A clear breakout above this zone is necessary for a bullish continuation.

 Immediate support is marked by the green descending trendline around $54,000. The next significant support zone is the green area between $43,000 and $46,000, which has historically provided a strong base.

 A breakout above the $65,000 resistance zone could lead to a continuation towards $70,000 and potentially higher levels. Positive momentum indicators would support this scenario.

 If Bitcoin fails to break above the current resistance and faces rejection, it may retest the descending trendline support around $54,000. A drop below this could see Bitcoin revisit the $46,000 support zone or lower.

 Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance zone, and its ability to break through or face rejection will dictate the next significant move. Watch for a decisive move in either direction for confirmation of trend continuation or reversal.

 This analysis is for informational purposes and not financial advice. Stay vigilant with market updates and adjust trading strategies accordingly.
Page 6, Article 21: The BTC/USDT weekly chart shows Bitcoin currently trading near $54,996, testing a descending trendline and a key horizontal resistance zone between $60,000 and $65,000.
There is a significant support zone between $43,000 and $46,000, which Bitcoin has respected in the past. This zone could serve as a strong base for a potential bounce if tested.

The highlighted resistance zone around $60,000 to $65,000 remains a critical area that Bitcoin needs to break above to confirm a bullish continuation.
The green support zone between $43,000 and $46,000 is the immediate downside target if Bitcoin continues to face selling pressure. Below this level, the ascending trendline offers additional support around the $40,000 level.
Potential Scenarios:

 If Bitcoin can hold above the $55,000 mark and push through the overhead resistance, we could see a rally towards the next psychological level of $70,000 and beyond. The upper arrow on the chart suggests optimism for a potential breakout.
 A failure to hold above current levels might lead to a retest of the lower support zones around $46,000, and potentially lower if market conditions worsen.

A weekly close above $65,000 would provide a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential continuation toward all-time highs.
Monitoring volume and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD on the weekly timeframe could provide early signals of a trend reversal or continuation.

The presence of a descending triangle pattern indicates potential consolidation before a major move. Market sentiment will play a key role in dictating the direction of the next breakout.
Broader market factors, including macroeconomic data and overall crypto market health, will influence BTC's price action.

Traders should watch the key support levels closely and consider stop-loss placements just below the $43,000 zone to manage risk effectively.
It's important to adjust positions based on Bitcoin's price action around these critical zones, especially near major support and resistance levels.
This weekly update provides an overview of the key levels and potential scenarios for BTC/USDT. With Bitcoin currently at a crossroads near important resistance, market participants should closely monitor for breakout or breakdown signals in the coming weeks.

Page 6, Article 22: Bitcoin  started to rise again after  Failing(Fake Break)  to break the  Support zone($58,000-$56,600) .

From the point of view of  Classical Technical Analysis , it seems that Bitcoin has formed a  Falling Wedge Reversal Pattern , and if the  upper line  of this pattern breaks, we can expect a  further increase in Bitcoin .

From the point of view of  Elliott wave theory , Bitcoin's  correction waves  seem to be continuing. The last corrective wave was the  Zigzag Correction(ABC/5-3-5) , which was the  end of wave C ,  $55,600 .

Also, we can see  Regular Divergence(RD+)  between Consecutive Valleys.

A  head and shoulders pattern could form , causing Bitcoin to  decline again  to nearly  $50,000==Two scenarios are possible üëá


I expect  Bitcoin  to move according to the movements  I have outlined in the chart .

 Note: If Bitcoin loses the Support zone($58,000-$56,600), we should expect Bitcoin to fall to $51,000(at least).

üîé If You Look At The Chart At High Timeframe There Is a Clear Impulsive Move From 16k Low Since November 2022 Till Now 

üëâ Wave 1 Completed At 31k 
üëâ Wave 2 Completed At 25k

üéØ 44k Is a Typical Target That I Expect As a Wave 4 Target But If We Loss This Level 39k Is The Next 


üîê Totally We Are In a Corrective Trend And Till 44k Every Things Is Bearish And When We Touch 44k I Can Say It‚Äôs a Final Target Or We Will See 39k
Page 7, Article 1: üìä#BTC reaches the staged resistance zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†We have been consolidating sideways in the selling zone for a long time. After finally digesting the selling pressure in this range, we chose to continue to break upward, so the selling zone turned into a support zone. At present, we have reached the stage resistance zone, and we do not recommend that you chase the rise in this range.

‚û°Ô∏èThe next resistance is located near the downward trend line (around 61k). If we develop relatively strongly, then the extreme resistance is located near the turning point 65175, which is also an ideal target area for the bull structure.

‚û°Ô∏èTherefore, we have locked in about 80% of the main profit, and will allow the remaining positions to wait for the ideal target without risk. üôèüéØ

Page 7, Article 3: We are now past Mercury's entire retrograde zone.

Moving forward I don't expect price to fall below @ 57041. That's close to the open on Thursday 12 September, which is the day that Mercury left His previous retrograde zone. I myself will try to get a fill to go long near Thursday's low.

  

On Monday 16 September Sun enters Virgo and reaches Venus's position of Sunday 25 August.

Bitcoin price will retest and  pass  65K on this date, continuing upwards.

After that I See bitcoin taking out its previous highs, because the next major downtrend only begins when Mars enters Cancer on Sunday 20 October. But for this leg up I hope to take profit at about 68K and then assess where to re-enter.

2Ô∏è‚É£11 September - publication of the CPI and inflation data in the United States.
3Ô∏è‚É£18 September - the results of the two-day Fed meeting, the announcement of a rate cut. It's elegant that this day is also a full moon, conspiracy theorists are on the base)
4Ô∏è‚É£20 September - a hat trick - a day when stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options expire on the same day. This happens only four times a year - on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, which can lead to a sharp increase in trading volume and volatility.

This is not financial advice, just a technical analysis.
Page 7, Article 9: If you haven`t sold the BTC top:


Now you need to know that the summer decline in Bitcoin's price, despite multiple ETF filings, can largely be attributed to the massive selling pressure from several key sources like Mt. Gox, Silk Road, FTX, and Germany.

This influx of supply overwhelmed the market, and there simply wasn't enough demand to absorb it. 
I think that the purpose of these ETFs is likely to stabilize Bitcoin rather than drive its price up dramatically. They're designed to bring more legitimacy and structure to the market. 

As for the technical outlook, the current formation of a falling wedge could indicate a short-term price increase. However, the expected retracement suggests that any near-term rally might be temporary. 
Longer term, I think Bitcoin has the potential to break higher, especially with more regulatory clarity and broader adoption. Reaching $80K by the end of the year seems possible, but a lot will depend on macroeconomic factors and the broader risk appetite in the crypto space.

Let's analyse BTCUSDT in HTF.

Bitcoin is currently trading within a parallel channel on the weekly timeframe. However, a recent breakdown below the channel's midline is a cause for concern, as it could indicate a potential bearish reversal.
If we zoom in, we could see Bitcoin currently trading below the mid-line of the parallel channel on the weekly timeframe. A weekly close above $60,441 is essential for maintaining bullish momentum and targeting $70,000.
However, a rejection from this level could lead to a significant pullback towards $46,000 - $44,000.
Recommendation: It's advisable to consider taking profits on your long positions between $59,000 and $59,500.

Key levels to watch:
- Weekly closing above $60,441
- Booking profits before  GETTEX:59K 
-  GETTEX:46K  to $44k zone if BTC rejects

Page 7, Article 12: - Macro Overview
Investors have withdrawn over 17,000 BTC, causing the total balance to drop below three million BTC, the lowest level since mid-July. The rise in stablecoin balances indicates investor preparation for upcoming significant economic events. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows reached $117 million, continuing to attract net inflows this week, signaling the potential for notable price volatility.

- Technical Analysis
BTCUSD saw a modest correction, forming higher lows before closing above both EMAs, indicating a shift towards a bullish structure. If BTCUSD extends gains above 58,200, the price could return to the psychological level of 60,000. Meanwhile, if BTCUSD corrects before continuing upward, it may pull back to the 56,500-57,200 range.

Utility of Market Sentiment

The indicator aggregates signals from multiple technical indicators across various timeframes to compute an overall market sentiment score. This comprehensive approach helps traders understand the prevailing market conditions by:

Confirming Trends: Multiple indicators pointing in the same direction can confirm the strength of a trend.
Identifying Reversals: Divergences and fractals can signal potential turning points.
Timeframe Alignment: Aligning signals across different timeframes can enhance the probability of successful trades.

---

Divergences

Divergence occurs when the price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of a technical indicator, suggesting a potential reversal.

- Bullish Divergence: Price makes a lower low, but the indicator makes a higher low.
- Bearish Divergence: Price makes a higher high, but the indicator makes a lower high.

The indicator detects divergences for:

RSI
MACD
Stochastic Oscillator

Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)

By identifying these divergences, traders can spot early signs of trend reversals and adjust their strategies accordingly.

---

Trendlines

Trendlines are essential tools for identifying support and resistance levels. The indicator automatically draws trendlines based on pivot points:

- Upward Trendlines (Support): Connect higher lows, indicating an uptrend.
- Downward Trendlines (Resistance): Connect lower highs, indicating a downtrend.

These trendlines help traders visualize the trend direction and potential breakout or reversal points.

---

Super Trend Reversals (ST Reversal)

The core idea behind the Super Trend Reversals indicator is to assess the momentum of automated trading bots (often referred to as 'Supertrend bots') that enter the market during critical turning points. Specifically, the indicator is tuned to identify when the market is nearing bottoms or peaks, just before it shifts direction based on the triggered Supertrend signals. This approach helps traders:

Engage Early: Enter the market as reversal momentum builds up.
Optimize Entries and Exits: Enter under favorable conditions and exit before momentum wanes.

By capturing these reversal points, traders can enhance their trading performance.

---

Conclusion

The Swiss Knife   indicator serves as a versatile tool that combines multiple technical analysis methods into a single, comprehensive indicator. By assessing various aspects of the market‚Äîincluding trend direction, momentum, volume, and price action‚Äîit provides traders with valuable insights to make informed trading decisions.

Page 7, Article 16: Looking at the chart for **Bitcoin (BTC/USDT)**, here‚Äôs a breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. **Market Structure:**
The chart shows a series of **consolidation ranges**, marked by the purple boxes, with the price moving between these ranges over time. These ranges suggest that the market is in a sideways, ranging phase, with clear support and resistance levels being respected. 

### 2. **Key Levels:**
- **Resistance Level (around 61,176 USDT):** Bitcoin is currently near a resistance zone, and from the recent history of the price movement, this level has acted as a barrier multiple times.
- **Support Level (around 59,569 USDT):** The price has bounced off this level a few times as well, and it seems to be a significant support zone in the current market.

### 3. **RSI Indicator:**
The RSI is hovering around **64**, which is approaching overbought territory but is not quite there yet. This suggests that the price could still move upward a bit before the market considers it overbought, but caution is warranted as a reversal could happen.

### 4. **Trade Plan:**
- Based on the current structure, you seem to be expecting a **rejection from the resistance** level near 61,176 USDT.
- The **downward arrow** in the chart indicates that you're anticipating a sell-off or correction once Bitcoin reaches this resistance zone, with the price potentially moving toward the next support area.

### 5. **Potential Targets:**
- **Short-Term Target:** You may expect the price to drop back to the 59,569 USDT level initially, which is the nearest support zone. 
- **Longer-Term Target:** If the price breaks through this support level, the next target could be around 54,000 USDT, as indicated by the lower support zone.

### 6. **Conclusion:**
This trade idea appears to be a **sell setup**:
- **Sell near resistance (61,176 USDT)** if a rejection occurs.
- **First target** at **59,569 USDT** (support).
- If the price breaks lower, you could look for a **further decline toward 54,000 USDT**.

This setup follows a classic range-bound trading strategy where the price is expected to reverse at resistance and head toward the nearest support level. Monitoring the RSI and price action around these key levels will be crucial for timing the entry and exit of the trade.
Page 7, Article 17: üìä#BTC is still in the selling zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, we are still within the target area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe double bottom bullish structure, and we still need to be alert to the occurrence of a callback before completely breaking through this range.

‚û°Ô∏èIf you want to participate in long trading, you need to wait patiently for the target area to break through. After the target area turns into a support area, you can then look for opportunities to enter the long position in this range.

‚û°Ô∏èIf we fail to break through the target zone and return to the support zone again, then we can consider participating in some new long trades.

Page 7, Article 18: I have been following the Bitcoin price action locally quite often, and would like to strategize a plan based on the current price action on the charts. 

At the moment, I believe we will likely move up to approx $60k to test the Value Area Low of the previous 6 month range. I do believe we will see seller's step in at that level and bring price back down below $50k where the low of the range liquidity can be taken and shoot right back up to grab the liquidity sitting above $70k. 

Being that rate cuts are quickly approaching, Im sure there will be some turbulence in the markets , especially around the election time. This uncertainty may bring us some amazing opportunities if we are well prepared.
Page 7, Article 19: Understanding the Business Cycle and the Strategic Importance of Holding Bitcoin Through Economic Phases 

The four phases of the business cycle‚ÄîEarly Expansion, Maturing Expansion, Late Expansion, and Recession‚Äîeach play a crucial role in shaping economic activities, investment trends, and asset performances. For those engaged in crypto trading and investment, particularly within the Global Miranda Miner Research Group, it's essential to understand how Bitcoin fits into these phases and why holding onto Bitcoin, especially during the Recession phase, can be a strategic move.

Early Expansion: The Foundation of Growth
The Early Expansion phase is marked by the economy's recovery from a recession. During this phase, employment rates start to rise, business profits increase, and consumer confidence is restored. This period is characterized by heightened investments in sectors like Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Industrials, Information Technology, and Real Estate. Notably, Bitcoin, as a technology-driven asset, tends to attract investors looking for growth opportunities in innovative markets.

Coach Miranda Miner, a respected figure in cryptocurrency education, emphasizes the importance of recognizing Bitcoin's potential during this phase. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group highlights that as investor sentiment shifts towards growth and innovation, Bitcoin's role as a pioneering asset becomes more prominent. Those who invest in Bitcoin during the Early Expansion phase can potentially benefit from its growth trajectory as the economy continues to strengthen.

Maturing Expansion: The Peak of Economic Growth
As the economy moves into the Maturing Expansion phase, growth reaches its peak. Inflation pressures begin to emerge, and the economic environment becomes more complex. Investment strategies typically shift towards sectors such as Communication Services, Financials, Industrials, Information Technology (including Bitcoin), and Real Estate.

According to insights from the Global Miranda Miner Research Group, this phase is a critical juncture for Bitcoin investors. Coach Miranda Miner advises that while the market may experience volatility due to inflation concerns, Bitcoin's inherent properties‚Äîsuch as its limited supply and decentralized nature‚Äîposition it as a potential hedge against inflation. Investors within the crypto community are encouraged to maintain their Bitcoin holdings during this phase, as it can serve as a safeguard against traditional market fluctuations.

Late Expansion: Navigating Slowdowns and Strategic Positioning
The Late Expansion phase is characterized by a slowdown in economic growth. Interest rates may rise in response to inflationary pressures identified during the Maturing Expansion phase. During this period, investments often shift towards more defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Energy, Financials, Health Care, Materials, and Real Estate.

For Bitcoin investors, this phase requires a strategic approach. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group suggests that while traditional markets may start to feel the strain of rising interest rates, Bitcoin‚Äôs unique attributes could provide a buffer. Coach Miranda Miner points out that as economic conditions become more uncertain, holding Bitcoin can serve as a valuable counterbalance to more traditional assets, potentially offering protection against economic slowdowns.

Recession: The Opportunity to Accumulate and Hold
The Recession phase, where economic activity contracts, is often viewed with apprehension by investors. Jobs may be eliminated, and interest rates typically begin to decline as the economy attempts to stabilize. During this phase, investments generally focus on defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples, Energy, Health Care, and Utilities.

However, the Global Miranda Miner Research Group views the Recession phase as a prime opportunity for Bitcoin accumulation. Coach Miranda Miner strongly advocates for holding Bitcoin through this phase, emphasizing that historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience during economic downturns. The Recession phase often leads to a flight to safety, where investors seek assets that are less correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized and finite nature, stands out as a potential store of value in these uncertain times.

The Strategic Importance of Holding Bitcoin
Across all phases of the business cycle, the consistent theme promoted by Coach Miranda Miner and the Global Miranda Miner Research Group is the importance of holding Bitcoin. While the Early Expansion and Maturing Expansion phases may present opportunities for growth and profits, it is during the Late Expansion and Recession phases that the strategic value of Bitcoin becomes more apparent.

Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to act as a hedge against inflation, its independence from central bank policies, and its limited supply make it a unique asset in an investor's portfolio. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group advises that by maintaining a long-term perspective and holding Bitcoin through various economic cycles, investors can position themselves to benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs potential appreciation, particularly in post-recession recoveries.

Coach Miranda Miner often underscores the value of patience and conviction in cryptocurrency investment. The cyclical nature of the economy suggests that downturns are followed by recoveries. Investors who hold Bitcoin during challenging economic periods are often rewarded when the economy rebounds, and Bitcoin‚Äôs value appreciates in response to renewed investor confidence.

Conclusion: Navigating the Business Cycle with Bitcoin
Understanding the four phases of the business cycle is essential for any investor, particularly those involved in the cryptocurrency space. For members of the Global Miranda Miner Research Group and followers of Coach Miranda Miner, recognizing the strategic importance of holding Bitcoin through these phases is crucial. While each phase presents its own set of challenges and opportunities, the consistent advice is clear: Bitcoin, with its unique characteristics, should be held as a long-term asset.

By embracing this strategy, investors can potentially safeguard their portfolios against economic uncertainties and position themselves to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs growth as the economy moves through its cycles. In the words of Coach Miranda Miner, "In the world of crypto, patience is a virtue, and holding Bitcoin through the storm often leads to brighter days

Page 7, Article 20: Our gameplan on the weekly timeframe remains the same, and we‚Äôre still hovering around the resistance zone after several tests.

As the price starts to pull away from this zone and sellers gradually take control, we‚Äôre now setting our eyes on the $40K neckline zone. Ideally, this move would bring the RSI into the oversold territory, creating a potential buying opportunity that could push the price towards $50K.

This gameplan will continue to be our guide over the next few months as we monitor how the market behaves.

Page 8, Article 3: DISCLAIMER: This is not trade advice. This is for educational and entertainment purposes only to demonstrate how I intend to participate in this market. Trading involves real risk. Do your own due diligence.

People like myself (with average-to-below average intelligence) need a simple strategy. 
My "Ducks in a Barrel" strategy is exactly that. Simple. Clear. Rules Based. Effective. Zero Discretion.

BTC (and several other cryptos, for that matter), are setup for "Ducks in a Barrel" long trades. Lets review the process for identifying these setups. To be clear, this is not a "long now" post. This market is SETUP. This is not a timing tool. We get into the market once we get a technical long TRIGGER on the Daily timeframe. From there, we FOLLOW THROUGH on the trade by managing risk and maximizing profit. Without the TRIGGER, we have not trade.

 STEP 1:  Identify a market with a strong trend on the weekly timeframe. I utilize the 39 and 52 period MA. For uptrends, we want to see both MA's sloping up and pulling away from each other. We see on BTC that the two MA's are still upward sloping and pulling away from each other. This confirms step 1, that we are in a strong uptrend.
 
STEP 2:  We need at least 2 of the following to be in unison with the direction we want to trade (in the case of BTC, we need 2 of these to support the long idea).
VALUATION: For longs, we need an undervaluation vs Gold &/or Treasuries.
STOCHASTIC: For longs, we need to see the market is oversold.
SENTIMENT: For longs, we want to see Bearish advisor sentiment (we fade the public sentiment).

 STEP 3:  We see that BTC is Oversold on the Stochastic and is Undervalued vs Gold & Treasuries. This meets our criteria of 2/3 indicators supporting our idea. This market is now SET UP for longs. Now we wait for the TRIGGER.

 STEP 4:  We are waiting for Step 4 in Bitcoin right now. We need to see an entry TRIGGER on the daily timeframe via one of the following entry techniques.
18 Period MA Entry
10 high 8 close MAC w/ Williams Acc/Dis 57 MA Confirmation Entry
Stop either 150% of 3 Period ATR, or 2 times the width of the MAC, whichever is greater.
There are other entry techniques, but they are higher risk. The two entry techniques above will not catch the absolute bottom, but will ensure that you are buying into a confirmed trend change. Other entry techniques come with the risk of trying to "bottom/top" pick, which increases your odds of several losses prior to the real move occuring.

If you have questions about the "Ducks in a Barrel" strategy, feel free to shoot me a message.

I hope you all have a great week.

And as always.....

Good Luck & Good Trading.
Page 8, Article 4: Main Concept 
 
 The core idea behind the Super Trend Reversals indicator is to assess the momentum of automated trading bots (often referred to as 'Supertrend bots') that enter the market during critical turning points. Specifically, the indicator is tuned to identify when the market is nearing bottoms or peaks, but just before it shifts direction based on the triggered Supertrend signals. This approach helps traders engage with the market right as the reversal momentum builds up, allowing for entry just as conditions become favorable and exit before momentum wanes.
 
 How It Works 
 
 The Super Trend Reversals uses multiple Supertrend calculations, each with different period and multiplier settings, to form a comprehensive view of the trend. The total trend score from these calculations is then analyzed using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to gauge the strength and sustainability of the trend.
 A key feature of this indicator is the isCurrentRangeSmaller() function, which evaluates if the current price range is lower than the average over the recent period. This function is critical as it helps determine the stability of the market environment, reducing the likelihood of entering or exiting trades based on erratic price movements that could lead to false signals.

(1D chart)

As I mentioned in the idea yesterday, the key is whether it can be supported around 56150.01-56950.56 and rise above the M-Signal indicator on the 1W chart.

Before that, we need to check whether it can rise above the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator and maintain the price by rising above 57889.10.

If it fails to rise above the MS-Signal indicator, it is likely to fall to around 52137.67.

-

The IBIT BTC ETF chart looks a little different in that there is a gap between the MS-Signal indicator and the IBIT indicator.

The location of the StochRSI indicator is also different.

On the BTCUSDT chart, it is just before entering the overbought zone, but on the IBIT chart, it is located near the 50 point.

Therefore, we need to check at what point the StochRSI indicator of the two charts enters the overbought zone and receives support.

-
It is expected that a full-scale volatility period will begin.

Since this volatility period was set on the 1W chart, it is likely to continue until September 29, so caution is required when trading.



If USDT or USDC continues to gap up, it is expected to continue to rise after the volatility period.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin when it rises above 29K.

The range expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.

Eventually I anticipate market to reach back to the $47000-45000 area to create a potential bottom.

And for this week I think we'll probably hit 50k. So this short right here could be the potential start of the move.

For me its a matter of when at this point not if bitcoin will make new lows. Its all about probabilities and based on my analysis that's where price is likely to go.

Happy Trade!
Page 8, Article 13: Market Analysis: 

The current market structure for Bitcoin (BTC) is exhibiting bearish tendencies. The price is approaching a significant high level, and there are potential selling pressures near the Order Block and Point of Interest (POI). Additionally, the Fibonacci Golden Zone is a critical area to watch.

 Trade Recommendation: 

If the price breaks below 55,100, it could indicate a surge in selling pressure. To capitalize on this potential downtrend, consider a short position.

 Trade Details: 

 Entry:  Sell BTCUSDT below 55,080
 Target:  54,400 - 54,000 - 53,800
 Stop Loss:  300-500 points

 Rationale: 

 Bearish Structure:  The overall market structure suggests a bearish trend.
 Order Block and POI:  These areas often act as resistance levels, and a break below them could trigger a sell-off.
 Fibonacci Golden Zone:  This zone represents a significant price level that could offer resistance.
 Liquidity:  The presence of large liquidity levels at 54,400 - 54,188 could provide support for a potential price decline.
 
Note:  This is a general recommendation based on the current market analysis. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any trading decisions.

Page 8, Article 18: Hello traders and investors! 

For a month, I followed the previous analysis. Now, I‚Äôve decided to create a new one. Let me remind you of the setup. 
Quotes:
 On the 8-hour time frame, a sideways range has also formed. The lower boundary is at 53,485, and the upper boundary is at 71,997.
On the 2-hour timeframe, the seller's vector 8-9 has reached the target of 56078. The volume and delta are conducive to gathering stop losses below the level. The quick recovery by the buyer after the breakout and the candle closing above 56078 increase the likelihood of the price dropping below the local low of 55606. For the buyer's range vector 9-10 to play out (with a potential target of 62745), it would be prudent to accumulate volume and push the price below the local low of 55606. 

In fact, the price followed the assumptions. What‚Äôs next? 

On the daily and 8-hour timeframes, the buyer absorbed the seller's candle and formed a buyer's zone. At the same time, on the 8-hour timeframe, the seller touched the lower boundary of the range at 53,485, from where the buyer resumed. 


On the 2-hour timeframe, the seller manipulated the level of the beginning of the buyer's last impulse (56,078) at point 7 of the range. The price is currently above this level. 


All these factors favor searching for buy opportunities. 

I f the buyer defends 56,078 , potential targets are 
 
 58,519, 59,005, and 62,745, 65000 on the 2-hour timeframe, 
 61,166, 62,198, and 70,079 on the 8-hour timeframe, 
 and 61,166, 62,745, 70,079, and 72,797 on the daily timeframe.
 

Good luck with your trading and investments!

Page 8, Article 21: Any deviation from the variables outlined here cancels the scenario and requires reassessment.

From $57,000, I expect a correction to the 4-hour imbalance, followed by an impulse up to $61,000-$62,000, where short positions can be considered. The target would be the imbalance likely forming around the $56,000-$57,000 range, from where we could fuel up for a move to $65,000. At $65,000, it's highly probable a short position with a target of $49,000 will be the best option.

However, if during the rise to $65,000, an area of interest forms on the weekly timeframe, I will not enter a short at $65,000 and will wait to see how things unfold with the new variables in mind.

Page 9, Article 1: Hello everyone, let's look at the current BTC situation considering the one hour interval.  In this situation, we can see how the price has moved higher from the local downtrend line above which it remains.
  Let's start by setting goals for the near future, which include:
T1- 60252$
T2- 62340$
T3- 64922$
  Now let's move on to the stop-loss in case the market continues to decline:
  SL1 = $58,076
  SL2 = $56,190
  SL3 = $555,256 AND
  SL4 = $54,044

  Looking at the RSI indicator, we see a movement at the upper limit, which may influence an attempt to recover or give a temporary sideways trend.
Page 9, Article 2: No matter who will be USA president, Bitcoin price will only go up
Page 9, Article 3: Bitcoin has been putting is some near term lower highs and lower lows. 

The daily chart trend is starting to breakdown and show signs of distribution. 

The weekly chart trend is still ok but even if we had a flush to 40k the Weekly chart would still display higher lows. 

The point of this higher low excercise is to define trend and know that trends can often have a large range. 

That being said I think a short setup in BTC is brewing. a retest of the 50 & 100  MA will likely prove to be very strong resistance as we keep losing the key larger term MA's. 

As banks and potentially the stock market lose some momentum its going to be interesting to see how crypto is going to hold up.

Page 9, Article 8: previous video
Page 9, Article 9: after sideway action i am expecting leg down, there is no catalyst in near future and effect from FED loosening policy we will se later

disclaimer: not financial advice
Page 9, Article 10: If you haven`t sold the top on Bitcoin:


Now you need to know that as the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated rate cut approaches, the market is bracing for potential volatility, and Bitcoin could be no exception. While many expect a modest 25 basis point cut, a more aggressive 50 basis point reduction is also on the table. This larger-than-expected move could trigger a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù scenario, affecting not only traditional assets like the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) but also risk assets like Bitcoin.

Initially, Bitcoin may see a slight uptick in price at the beginning of next week. This short-term rise could be fueled by optimism and increased demand for alternative assets as the market digests the Fed's decision. Bitcoin has historically benefited from periods of loose monetary policy, and in the immediate aftermath of the rate cut, it might experience some buying pressure.

However, this rally could be short-lived. With broader markets such as SPY and QQQ expected to correct following the Fed decision, Bitcoin is likely to follow suit. Given its high correlation with risk-on assets during periods of market stress, Bitcoin may see a sharp pullback as traditional equity markets start to sell off. Traders could also unwind their positions in Bitcoin alongside stocks, leading to a broader market correction in both traditional and crypto assets.

In the short term, a Fed rate cut that exceeds expectations might signal concerns about the underlying economy, leading to heightened volatility across the board. As risk appetite wanes, Bitcoin's upward momentum could quickly reverse, aligning with the expected correction in SPY and QQQ.
Page 9, Article 11: Current Range: BTC is trading within a significant horizontal range between approximately $52,000 (support) and $68,000-$72,000 (resistance). This range has been respected since March 2024, with several bounces between these levels.

Descending Channel Breakout: Recently, BTC has broken out of a descending channel pattern (marked by the white lines). This breakout suggests a potential shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. If this breakout holds, BTC may see a continuation of upward movement.
 Around $54,000 (near the green trendline), which has acted as a strong support level throughout this range.
The upper boundary of the range near $68,000-$72,000 remains the key level to watch for any potential breakout to the upside.

If BTC continues to hold above the breakout level and gains momentum, the next major resistance will be the upper range boundary near $68,000-$72,000. A successful breakout above this level could potentially target higher levels around $76,000.


If BTC fails to maintain the breakout and falls below the descending channel, we could see a retest of the lower support around $54,000. A break below this level would likely lead to a test of the lower range boundary around $52,000 or even lower levels.
Momentum indicators like RSI or MACD were not included in the chart, but adding these could confirm the breakout's strength.
BTC/USDT shows potential for further upside following the breakout from the descending channel, with key levels to watch at $68,000-$72,000 for resistance and $54,000 as immediate support. As long as BTC maintains above the breakout level, the bias remains bullish, but caution is warranted near the upper boundary of the range.

Page 9, Article 12: It continues to look more likely that Bitcoin has put in a higher low at $52,500, although this will not be confirmed until we break above $65,000. There is nothing meaningful on the chart, but it is encouraging to see price back in the range and continuing to head up. 

September is almost halfway over!
Page 9, Article 13: Last week, the price closed below the previous low, forming another lower low. This further confirms that Bitcoin is in a bearish trend, which has been ongoing for the past six months.

The crucial level at the moment is $64,220 (the last formed high). This key level separates us from a bullish (upward) trend. If the price on the weekly timeframe can break this level and close above it, it will be a very important indicator of a trend reversal. Until then, we remain in a bearish trend.
Page 9, Article 14: I've reviewed hundreds of coins in the past few days, and I can confidently say ‚Äî they're in a tough spot right now 

The charts have dropped so much that many no longer believe in the success of these coins. As an analyst, I see global descending wedges starting to form ‚Äî a phenomenon I observed before the previous bull market.

As for BTC, I‚Äôm seeing prolonged consolidation with the removal of all levels. Experience tells me that autumn is the "golden time" for crypto, so the BTC fractal might play out, as I‚Äôve shown in detail on the chart.
Page 9, Article 15: BlackRock is nowhere to be found... And I noticed that lately Michael Saylor hasn't been buying any Bitcoins. What to make of this information?

One way to look at the Bitcoin market from a rookie bullish perspective, is through the story that Bitcoin is strong and cannot move lower because (1) the Spot ETFs (aka. BlackRock) will buy everything and (2) Michael Saylor "bought Bitcoin."

This is a true story.

Bitcoin is still trading at $57,700.

Now, what if you are one of those Spot ETFs and MS Bought Bitcoin kind of person, how are you feeling now that these people are nowhere to be found? Does this lowers your confidence in Bitcoins ability to maintain its current price, or, are we still aiming for 100K next?

The correction is on! and has been ongoing for almost six months now.  We are about to experience what traders call the final "leg down." 

It is very intriguing, I can feel the suspense in the air... But we have bearish action, lower lows and normally, when you are about to experience a very strong rise everything is green, day after day. Right now I am only seeing red.

What do you make of the current situation?
Is Bitcoin going up or down?

Prepare for the crash.

We are trading the altcoins but remember, and this is very important, at first, everything can experience a very strong negative reaction but everything soon stabilises. The smaller ones will recover sooner, some will not even flinch. Others will grow... We looked at this many times through hundreds of charts. 

The big ones, the giants, are going to crash together with Bitcoin. You already know about those.
The altcoins trading against Bitcoin, some are safe but prepare to hold strong for a few days.

The tether pairs are mixed. Each chart should be considered individually.

I am wishing you the best.

Once the correction is over, we will be sharing bullish charts, LONG, until late 2025.
It will be awesome.

I love you.
You are truly appreciated.

Thanks a lot for your amazing support.
I love life.

Namaste.

Page 9, Article 18: Bitcoin is positioned to break through the $60,000 resistance, supported by bullish momentum and strong technical indicators. A sustained move above this level could propel the price to $63,000, with the 0.618 Fibonacci level providing solid support around $55,300 in case of a pullback.

Page 9, Article 21: Hello, I'm Whale_signal

Before that, we'll review the 1H-BTCUSDT chart

The problematic spot was an hour stick, showing a flow of settling the orange whale surface, and then a sharp drop came out immediately

There are probably people who hosted LONG on that spot

1. If you have made a buy on Whale Indicators, you should designate an entry price cut right away
-> Whale indicators are strong indicators, so if they break, which direction? We don't know how much the price will be pushed
-> Profit is important, but risk response comes first

2. There's been a $250 rise from the orange whale indicator and $250 in the futures market is definitely not a small profit
-> Even if you didn't eat $250, you could have avoided a big loss if you designated it as a stopper

I don't feel good because there might be people who lost money. From now on, please make sure to proceed with the stoppage


1H - BTCUSDT Update


It's a very complicated seat. I think it'll help, so I've added a white whale indicator

If it fails to rise above the orange whale index, it could continue to face downward pressure, and if it deviates below, it could see mid to late 46K to late 47K

And if the mid to late 46K to 47K are also breached, please refer to the 1D-BTCUSDT purple whale indicator

You have to be careful because it's continuously being pushed down and it's located under the purple whale indicator



***whale surface intensity***

Purple>>>Orange>>>White
(Purple indicators are the strongest)

Here is the new update about your target 
if you missed it then don't regeret it again give chances..

Page 9, Article 23: The Cumulative Volume Delta Divergence is an indicator that helps traders visually assess the buying and selling pressures in the market by analyzing volume divergences over time. This indicator overlays directly on the price chart, offering insights into how volume shifts correlate with price movements.

Utility and Trading Benefit
Divergence Detection
The primary utility of this indicator lies in its ability to detect divergences between volume trends and price movements. Such divergences can signal potential price reversals, providing traders with early warnings about shifts in market sentiment.
Enhanced Decision Making
By integrating volume analysis directly with price action on the chart, the indicator aids traders in making more informed decisions regarding entry and exit points. This can be crucial for capitalizing on trends or avoiding potential losses.

Page 10, Article 6: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, more than 30,000 Bitcoins have been transferred to Binance earlier today...

In a previous article, we mentioned the best case scenario and the idea of ignoring the worst case scenario, this can be a mistake. The truth is that Bitcoin, the Cryptocurrency market, tends to surprise, always, either on the bullish or bearish side. Regardless of what happens, it is always wise to consider all scenarios.

The altcoins are correcting below our baseline, which we defined as the price level at which these projects traded around January 2024. The truth is that most altcoins are going back to October 2023 price levels. This is the same price at which the market traded before the major 2023/24 bullish wave; after the long consolidation phase.

Some altcoins did even worse and went lower to break below their June 2023 low and others broke down even further, including big and highly recognized projects, and crashed below their May/June 2022 low reaching new All-Time Lows. Bitcoin is currently trading at the same price it traded back in April/March 2024; very high by all standards.

The higher it trades, and the longer it takes to drop, the stronger the strength of the bearish move. This is called bearish consolidation, which in turn is a distribution phase. The distribution phase is termed so because the big players and large Bitcoin holders distribute their coins to the rest of the market.

Just as a long six months bullish consolidation (accumulation) phase led to a massive bullish rise. In reverse, a long six months bearish consolidation (distribution) phase can lead to a massive bearish crash.

Bitcoin grew just like certain altcoins, it did better than most. Only a few projects grew more than Bitcoin in terms of previous past action. Meaning, only a few projects moved to hit new All-Time Highs. It was Bitcoin and these few. The rest produced a strong wave in late 2023, others minimum growth.

While we know and assume that Bitcoin isn't likely to crash as the altcoins, because of its size and fame, look what happened to Ethereum... And Ethereum is gearing up for another round of the same. The same dynamic where Junk-base is buying billions of Ether to sell to Spot ETF holders at a low price continue. They are accumulating to sell en-mass.

Hope for the best; prepare for the worst.

The best scenario puts Bitcoin at $40,000 as the correction bottom. This can easily still be true.

A stronger correction would send Bitcoin lower toward the $33,000 - $36,000 price range.

A doom scenario and things getting really bad, for whatever reason because things tend to develop always as a surprise, would be Bitcoin between $33,000 and $26,000 on a wick. $26,000 is the price at which Bitcoin traded in October 2023, which is before the final impulse that led to our newest and latest All-Time High of $73,777.

Regardless of the general perception, such a move wouldn't change much in how Bitcoin continues to grow and evolve in the long-term. This can happen if some unforeseen event hits the market. Also because we have about 3 weeks of continued bearish action, which is plenty of time for everything to show up. The least expected scenario is always the one that comes to pass.

There is always good news... The stronger the correction, the stronger the recovery that will follow.

The stronger the panic, the stronger is the lesson that the market participants will learn.

The bigger the shock, the stronger the market reaction and after the recovery happens, more confidence in the system develops and everybody will know for certain, forever that Bitcoin is here to stay.

I am not saying that we will necessarily see $26K but, prepare for the worst... Just in case.

Namaste.
Page 10, Article 7: Hi guys, this is my overview for BTCUSDT, feel free to check it and write your feedback in commentsüëä

Recently price entered to rising channel, where it rose until to resistance line, breaking $64400 level.

Next, price turned around and made downward impulse to $49000 points, breaking two levels and exiting from rising channel.

After this, price started to trades inside pennant, where it at once bounced up from support line.

Price broke $55300 level and later rose to resistance line of pennant, which coincided with resistance level.

But a not long time ago BTC bounced and fell to support line, where at the moment continues to trades near.

Now, I think price can bounce from this line to $61600, exiting from pennant pattern.

Page 10, Article 8: We retested our long POI on very strong momentum caused by SPX flow.

We could look for shorts at a sweep of our local highs around 58.1k, but I'd expect it to overshoot and give us 59.1 or the 59.8-60.6 zone where value got capped a few times in the past weeks.

I'm still not ruling out new lows, but the reaction at this 60k zone will be important to monitor and determine the next few weeks of price action possibly.
Page 10, Article 9: TLDR: 
The prevailing concept in CT is that once the Fed begins a QE cycle, prices of financial assets immediately shoot up. 
The data from two previous cycles tell a different story. The market doesn‚Äôt immediately react to rate cuts, if at all. It is after the rate cuts ended that the uptrend begins. 
 2007/2008 Rate Cut Cycle: 
Based on historical data from 2007 and 2008, Nasdaq 100. The first month of QE resulted in a bullish response. However, it was followed by a downtrend until the rates were zero. 
    
 2019/2020 Rate Cut Cycle: 
Based on the BLX chart. Excluding the initial bullish reaction, this QE cycle did not affect Bitcoin‚Äôs price. After rates were at zero, Bitcoin‚Äôs uptrend began. 
  
 Takeaways From Previous QE Cycles 
1. Fed cuts don‚Äôt change the trend. At least until the cutting cycle is over. 
2. Even if we assume a bullish reaction, it is short-lived. 
3. The Fed is late in responding to market conditions. 
4. The chances of a 50% rate cut in September are low. 
5. The Fed overreacts to recession conditions.
6. When the markets begin to tumble, it is a dumpster fire. The fed cannot put out the fire with rate cuts. 
 Bitcoin Cycle Analysis: 
My macro-outlook for Bitcoin remains that Bitcoin is in the process of completing a wave four correction, after which I expect a continuation of the bullish trend to at least 80K.
Within the wave four correction, the two primary scenarios are:
  
 Complex Correction: 
This scenario presumes that Bitcoin is in a wave four correction. According to this scenario, the final leg down in wave C of Y is missing. 
If this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, Bitcoin should begin wave C to the downside after hitting the reversal zone between 0.618 and 0.786 retracements. 
  
 ABCDE Triangle Breakout: 
According to this scenario, Bitcoin‚Äôs wave four bottom was on August 5th. Bitcoin consolidates in an ABCDE triangle before breaking out to the upside in the final 5th wave. 
If this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, Bitcoin is close to the 0.618 retracement. I expect it to be rejected between 61.1K and 62.5K (wick) to complete the final E wave. This will become the primary scenario if it can find support at around 54K and break out of the triangle. 
  
 Direct Breakout Scenario: 
This scenario assumes that Bitcoin finished the correction process on September 6th and is now on the verge of a breakout. Even if this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù scenario, I expect a pullback to 57K - 58K before continuing. 
 High Probability Support and Resistance Levels: 
1. 65K. Resistance.
 2. 62.5K. Resistance. 
3. 61K. Resistance.
 4. 58K. Support.  
5. 56K. Support. 
 6. 54K. Support.

Page 10, Article 14: Bitcoin's looking bearish short-term. Key supports to watch: 54,800 and the CME gap at 54,000. I expect a bullish reversal around 53,500-54,000. Resistance is strong at 58,000 and 59,000. My take: we'll see a dip before any upward movement.

IF SPEX is red on Monday, BTC definitely will be.

I'll take the odds.
Page 10, Article 20: Dated today,  PHEMEX:BTCUSDT.P   had dropped 33% from it's All-time High $73851 at 14th March 2024. Despite the overall bearish sentiment in the market, Bitcoin's recent creation of a Higher Low $52500 at 6th September suggests a potential bullish reversal.

Today, we will delve into how the price of BTC might move in the next few days.

 1. Bullish Breakout.  
If Bitcoin can break above its previous high near $65,000, it would signal a strong bullish reversal. Following this, a period of accumulation might occur, to accumulate more buying power before a push towards the next resistance level around $72,000.

 2. Bearish Drop.  
Alternatively, Bitcoin could continue its downward trend, potentially retesting support levels at $50,000 and $41,900. To assess whether these levels offer buying opportunities, consider the trading volume and Relative Strength Index (RSI) during the decline.If the trading volume is lower than it was on August 5th and the RSI is higher, $50,000 might be a good price to buy the dip. However, if the volume is higher and the RSI is lower, $41,900 could be a better choice for buying low.

 3. Consolidation.  
Given the recent volatility, a period of consolidation between $65,000 and $52,500 is possible. This scenario might present opportunities for traders to employ Phemex Neutral Grid bots to profit from price fluctuations.

 Conclusion 
Bitcoin's price action suggests a potential bullish reversal. However, it's important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and technical analysis should be used in conjunction with other factors when making trading decisions. By carefully analyzing the technical indicators and considering potential scenarios, traders can develop informed strategies to navigate the market.
