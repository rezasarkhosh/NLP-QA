I can see some 50M USD in LONGs liquidations being reported at Coinglass for Ethereum in the past 24 hours... My friends, the bearish wave (correction) is not over.

Ethereum can easily hit $1500/$1750, or even lower.
Some calculations put the bottom at $1200 or even $800.

It might not go that low but I'll tell you what, it is way too early go LONG.

Wait patiently, the market will give clear signals when the bottom is in.
We will see massive green all across, within hours after the bottom hits.

Right now everything is red and this is not the end.

Patience is key.

Namaste.

BINANCE:ETHUSD  is forming a counter-trend bounce and is aiming for strong resistance amid a bearish trend. The project is going through a rough patch, fumbling for a market bottom... 

  

 ETH faces troubles::  
WisdomTree has requested the withdrawal of its ETH (Ethereum Trust) fund registration application three years after filing with the SEC. Earlier, VanEck closed its futures ETH-ETF, citing lack of demand. 
Likewise, indicators suggest that Whale stopped accumulating ETH since July. Since then, they have been mostly selling. 
Technically, we see the market being squeezed by strong resistance: trend lines as well as moving averages, which may negatively affect the market, keeping the coin from rising.

 Resistance levels: 2375, 2460, 2510. 
Support levels: 2309, 2111 

The coin is heading towards the resistance and liquidity area amid a bearish trend. This can be seen as a manipulated move to capture liquidity before further testing the intermediate bottom. I expect a decline from the mentioned zones towards 2100-2000. 

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:ETHUSD   ;)

In my current analysis of the Ethereum/USDT daily chart, I observe several technical indicators and chart patterns that influence my trading strategy. As of the latest data, Ethereum is trading at approximately $2,351.80, reflecting a positive change of 2.44% on the day.

The chart reveals Ethereum is navigating within a downward trend channel, highlighted by the consecutive lower highs and lower lows, which suggests a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market. This is further supported by the descending red trendline, marking a significant resistance point that Ethereum has struggled to overcome.

Focusing on the support (S1) and resistance levels (R2, R3, R4), it's evident that Ethereum has recently tested and failed to breach the resistance at $3,019.87 (R2). If Ethereum attempts to recover, the next critical resistance level to watch is $4,082.68 (R4), which aligns with previous highs.

The Fibonacci retracement levels, drawn from the high in May to the recent low, indicate that the 0.618 retracement level at $3,019.87 (R2) has served as a significant barrier. A sustained move above this level could signal a potential reversal of the downtrend, whereas failure to break above could see Ethereum retesting the support at $2,080.64 (S1).

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents a divergent view, with the MACD line approaching the signal line for a potential bullish crossover. This suggests that upward momentum might be building, despite the prevailing downtrend.

Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 39.99, which is near the oversold territory. This might indicate a possible strengthening or reversal in Ethereum's price action, as sellers could exhaust, paving the way for buyers to step in.

In conclusion, while the short-term outlook for Ethereum appears bearish within the context of the trend channel, there are emerging signs of a potential reversal. Key resistance and support levels will guide my trading decisions. Should Ethereum breach the $3,019.87 resistance convincingly, it may open up the path towards higher resistances. Conversely, a break below the $2,080.64 support could exacerbate the bearish pressure, targeting lower price levels.

Dear Traders, 

Hope you are doing great, we have an excellent update on ETH, possibility of big move is inevitable. We wanted to make sure that we have right area to buy eth and that is why we were watching the crypto pair since long time now. Now we think there is high possibility of price touching the previous HH on daily and monthly candle. Please be minded that, this is not 100% confirm and instead take this as a possibility.

Hello guys.

If you are a risk appetizer read it:

 Descending Trendline Break:  The price is approaching two descending trendlines. A breakout above these trendlines would signal a potential bullish move.

 Internal Trendline:  An internal trendline is also visible, marking a shorter-term resistance. The engulfing pattern near this line suggests bullish pressure building up.

 Support Zone:  The horizontal yellow zone near the 2,180 level shows a strong support area, where the price previously found buying interest. This area has held, indicating demand.

 Engulfing Candle:  The engulfing candle indicates a potential bullish reversal, confirming the bounce from the support zone and signaling a potential trend shift.
 
Target Zone:  The blue rectangular zone around the 2,820 level represents the target for this move. If the price breaks through the trendlines and sustains upward momentum, this could be the next major resistance area.

 Bullish Potential:  If the breakout is confirmed with volume, the target around 2,820 becomes achievable. However, failure to break the trendlines could result in a retest of the support around 2,180.

 This setup suggests a bullish bias, contingent on a successful breakout above the descending trendlines.

Another week is here and we see already some struggle near our zone (where price has to bounce from).

Now, as we have previously mentioned, ideally we should see a upward movement from here and a bounce, but it seems that the volume of buyers is not strong enough and sellers are taking control here. 

If it continues like that, we will see further pressure here and a possible break of trend to happen (which would start a nasty downward movement from here).

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Please also click "Boost".

Have a nice day today.

-------------------------------------

As you study candles, you will learn about trend reversal sections.

Therefore, rather than learning the shapes or patterns of candles, when you study them, you will be able to see the support and resistance points and sections made up of the selling area and trend reversal sections in a big picture.

Therefore, rather than trying to memorize the shapes or arrangements of candles, it is important to see whether support and resistance points and sections are formed when such shapes, arrangements, and patterns appear.

The same goes for other studies related to charts.

-

As you study candles, you will find that what you have studied appears in the sections where candles are gathered.


These areas are drawn as horizontal lines to indicate support and resistance points.

However, objective information is needed to conduct trading on the horizontal lines drawn like this.

Otherwise, even the support and resistance points you drew will likely become useless lines if you conduct barrack trading because you don't trust them.

Be careful because your psychological state will interfere with analyzing the chart.

-
The easiest way to obtain this objective information is the Heikin Ashi chart and the Renko chart.

The Heikin Ashi chart and the Renko chart help you check the trend because they show fewer fakes and sweeps.

(Heikin Ashi chart)


(Renko chart)


Among these, you can immediately see that the Renko chart is a bit easier to find support and resistance points.

-

You can think of the points near the end of the blocks on the Renko chart as having strong support and resistance points.

Therefore, among the horizontal lines drawn on the chart above, the 2800.0 and 4000.0 points are the end points of three blocks, so they can be seen as strong support and resistance points.


If you change the Renko chart to a regular candle chart, you can clearly see that it will form support and resistance points or sections.

However, since the Renko chart changes the price in blocks, it is difficult to trade at this point.

Therefore, the Heikin Ashi chart or Renko chart is good to use when analyzing the chart, but it is difficult to trade.

-

To compensate for this, we created a horizontal line at the price position using indicators (StochRSI, OBV, CCI, RSI) that have been used for a long time.

The horizontal line connected to the current candle position plays the role of the current support and resistance point.

And, since the longer the horizontal line, the stronger the support and resistance role, you can see that it plays the role of support and resistance even if it is not connected to the current candle.

-
The support and resistance points drawn on the Heikin Ashi chart or Renko chart are difficult to use for trading, but you can easily check the support and resistance section by looking at only the 1D chart.

However, in order to display support and resistance points with a general candle chart, support and resistance points must be displayed on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

And, the order of charts with strong support and resistance is 1M > 1W > 1D charts.

-



When you look at the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts using the HA-MS indicator, horizontal lines like the above are displayed.


You can display them by changing the line type or line thickness to make them easier to see and then proceed with trading.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The above content corresponds to the method of finding support and resistance points included in general chart-related books.

Of course, it is different from the explanation in the chart-related book, but I explained how to use indicators to more clearly indicate support and resistance points.

-
Even if you trade with the support and resistance points above, it will not work well when you actually trade.

This is because you are not familiar with the most important trading strategy in trading.

In conclusion, the most important thing is to create a trading strategy, rather than finding the support and resistance points explained above, looking at the trend line, or looking at indicators.

However, it is very difficult to create a trading strategy that fits your investment style from the beginning.

So, you should practice creating a trading strategy that suits you while trading based on the information of the objective chart.

In order to trade, you need to decide on the following three things:
1. Investment period
2. Investment size
3. Trading method and profit realization method

The above three things must be determined.

No. 1 and 2 are determined according to your investment style.

Therefore, it is recommended not to change No. 1 and 2 after you start trading.

3. Based on the information of the actual chart, the buy section, sell section, and stop loss point are determined.

In addition, the profit realization method can be determined according to the investment period.

The profit realization method is:
1. How to get cash profit
2. How to increase the coin (token) corresponding to the profit
There are methods 1 and 2 above.

-
In order to create a trading strategy, it is important to display all the information you want on the chart before starting the transaction.

If you do not, and then display lines on the chart after starting the transaction, psychological factors will be added and displayed, so the possibility of not trusting the lines drawn after starting the transaction increases.

To prevent this, it does not matter if you use the indicator added to the HA-MS indicator.

The reason is because it is objective information.

You should increase profits or reduce losses by adjusting the investment ratio while conducting the transaction using this objective information.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

On a smaller timeframe, we had another rejection from that small resistance zone where price is being pressured into a corner here. 

Now with that sharp trend we have (bullish), we are looking for a short setup to form here but before that, we need to see a break of the lower Bollinger Bands Line, which will also break the trend line. 

If we do not see that and we see another test to resistance zone, then we will see most likely a move to 200 EMA.

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  has been in a consolidation phase since the beginning of this month, by forming higher lows, which suggests buying pressure. On the weekly timeframe, the formation of a double bottom is a strong indication of a potential reversal. While I believe the market may consolidate a bit more before start of the bullish trend, it‚Äôs also likely to establish a range zone below the channel border before breaking out. If the market breaks and closes above the previous week high we can expect further upward momentum. My target is resistance zone around 2597.00

The crypto market never sleeps which means leaving your holdings stagnant could mean missing out on significant opportunities. 

So it‚Äôs time to ask yourself:

Are your assets maximizing their potential, or are they just gathering virtual dust?
You wouldn‚Äôt leave all your money in a low interest savings account, so why do it with your crypto?

The idea is to put your investments to work, so they keep earning returns without you lifting a finger. I‚Äôll walk you through exactly how to read it and use it to your advantage.

But that‚Äôs just the beginning, we‚Äôll also be covering:

-Yield strategies: A breakdown of the strategies we use to generate yield.
-Pros and cons: The advantages and drawbacks of each strategy.

Not sure what options are best for you?
Are you letting your capital sit idle? 
Worried about security risks? 

This analysis is about to change that .I‚Äôll show you how to maximize your returns and crush those security fears, so you can confidently put your assets to work

Let's dive right in and kick things off with the ‚Äòcrowd favorite‚Äô of yield strategies:  staking 

Staking is exclusive to Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains and their associated tokens.

Meaning you cannot gain staking yield from Bitcoin, for example, because it is a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain. by staking your tokens like  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  or  CRYPTOCAP:SOL , you receive a portion of newly minted tokens, effectively earning yield while playing a vital role in securing the network.

If you‚Äôre not staking, you could be missing out on significant gains, with potential returns ranging from 3% to 18% APY. that‚Äôs why many investors choose to stake their assets rather than let them sit idle



Staking has become a widely adopted strategy, with staking ratios (amount staked vs. unstaked) sitting between 20% and 80% on most POS blockchains In fact, a staggering $520 billion is currently staked across the top PoS blockchains, underscoring its popularity as a method for generating additional income.

Assuming an average 5% reward rate, that equates to $25 billion in staking rewards. That‚Äôs massive.

Despite the appeal of earning extra income through staking, becoming a solo staker can be technically challenging which is why staking providers like Lido, Rocket Pool, and Jito have emerged.

They handle network validation for the rest of us, while maximizing our staking yield. 

Let‚Äôs break down the pros and cons of using a staking provider:

Pros:

‚úÖ Security and efficiency: Our tokens are put to work securely and efficiently, contributing to the network‚Äôs security without us having to manage it all ourselves.

‚úÖ Maximized rewards: We earn the majority of staking rewards without needing to handle the technical complexities, making it a hassle-free way to generate income.

‚úÖ Liquidity retention: We receive liquid tokens as proof of our staked assets, allowing us to stay flexible and use them in other DeFi opportunities.

Cons:

 ‚ùå Fees: These providers typically charge a fee ranging from 8% to 25% for their validation services, which can slightly reduce your overall yield.

 ‚ùå Smart contract risks: There are inherent risks associated with smart contracts, such as bugs and/or vulnerabilities, that could potentially impact your staked assets. 

By weighing these pros and cons, you can decide whether outsourcing your staking through liquid staking providers is the right strategy for you.

Ok, so if that‚Äôs the case how do we go about choosing the right liquid staking provider?

Here are some key factors to consider when selecting a provider:

1/ Reputation and security

Track record: Look for providers with a solid track record and a strong reputation in the DeFi space. 

Security measures: Ensure the provider employs robust security measures, such as smart contract audits. 

 2/ Total volume locked

TVL: Check how much liquidity your chosen provider has attracted.

TVL is a quick and effective measure of the broader market's trust in a provider, as it reflects the total amount of assets currently staked or locked in their protocol, valued in dollars.

Feel free to use DefiLlama, which ranks all liquid staking providers by TVL.

Simply select the blockchain you‚Äôre interested in, and you‚Äôll see the top players in the space, giving you a clear view of where the most assets are being staked and which providers are leading the market. 

 3/ Yield rates

Competitive yields: Compare the staking yields offered by different providers. While higher yields are attractive, they should not come at the expense of security or reliability.

Fee structure: Be aware of the fee structure. Liquid staking providers typically charge a small fee for their services, which can impact your overall returns. 

 4/ Liquidity and flexibility

Liquid staking tokens (LSTs): Check if the liquid tokens issued by the provider are widely accepted across DeFi platforms and have enough liquidity. The more integration and liquidity these tokens have, the better.

Redemption options: Some providers offer instant or flexible redemption options for your staked tokens, which can be crucial if you need quick access to your assets. 

 5/ Decentralization and governance

Decentralization: Providers that are more decentralized tend to be more resilient to risks such as regulatory actions or central points of failure. 

Governance participation: Some providers offer governance rights with their tokens, allowing you to have a say in the protocol‚Äôs future direction. This can be an added benefit for those interested in being more involved in the ecosystem. 

 6/ Community and support

Active Community: A strong, active community can be a good indicator of a provider‚Äôs health and future prospects. Engage with the community to gauge the level of transparency and support. 

so while you trading and trying to maximize your gains Its good to stake some of your HODL bag as well

Ethereum buyers are struggling to maintain the current push from the lower support zone. 

This is a very crucial zone for buyers, as if they do not show any dominance here we will see a failed double bottom pattern, which usually ends with a very sharp selloff near that support zone. 

So we wait to see one of two things: either a huge green candle or a slow movement to support where we will be looking for a short position!

Ethereum has a nice small break of a sharp trend that turned around after some fall and now is heading towards the 200EMA.

üîç Technical analysis:  Ascending channel and corner alcove formation in the green support box area 

- Continuing the analysis of the  previous post , the Ethereum currency faced selling pressure after reaching the daily and weekly supply range.

- After the formation of a Double Top pattern, it has had a zigzag correction to the green box range.

- It is currently moving in an ascending channel, where the recent correction has intersected with the bottom of the channel and the green box.

- Therefore, I expect it to grow up to Fibo 0.78 and the dynamic trigger after the swing breaks and creates a higher LH.

- In addition, a corner pattern with higher bottoms of the ascending channel is also formed.

üíé Alternative scenario:  If it fails to break the swing and does not stabilize above it, and also sharply corrects towards the green box, it is most likely that it will break it and continue correcting towards the Buyer Zone.

üíé Probable scenario:  Currently, the probable scenario is the bullish scenario according to the bullish channel and also the corner pattern pattern. Therefore, after reaching the goal, the dynamic update will be done again.

üê∫ Hello dear KIUCOIN community üê∫

I hope you doing well ; in this idea I want to give you a very good and  exciting news about ETH  and also I would try to make this idea  brief but very useful   üî•üëá :
  

As you can see on the chart, ETH is forming a large  ascending triangle , which is considered a  bullish pattern . However, this pattern is on the weekly chart. The good news is that when this pattern breaks, we could anticipate a significant ETH and altcoin season, which I believe would be a  life-changing opportunity for you all. 


Now let's analyze the daily chart to identify potential entry points for long or short positions. Who knows, we might find a great opportunity!
  

As you can see in the chart above,  if ETH breaks through the orange resistance line , we could consider entering a  long trade  with a  risk/reward ratio of around 1.5 , which I believe is an acceptable level for initiating a trade .

 üôèüî• Don't forget to follow me on X. You can find the links in my bio and below this idea üôèüî•

and also always remember : üëá

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  has been showing strong recovery patterns recently, and the technical indicators align with a potential bullish move in the coming months. On the weekly chart,  COINBASE:ETHUSD  has reached the bottom of an ascending channel, which historically has acted as a strong support zone. This $2K region is not only a psychological barrier but also a key support level that was previously a resistance. As ETH continues to hold above this zone, a rise toward its all-time high (ATH) becomes increasingly probable.

Recent data suggests that 2024 could witness a broader crypto bull run, driven by Ethereum and other major assets. Analysts are optimistic about increased adoption cycles following 2023‚Äôs groundwork. Ethereum could benefit from market-wide positive sentiment as key events like Bitcoin‚Äôs upcoming halving and ETF inflows are expected to drive demand for cryptocurrencies.

With the technical alignment and favorable market conditions, ETH is well-positioned to see significant growth, potentially targeting levels near  EUROTLX:4K  as it continues its rise within the ascending channel. This rally could be bolstered by investor confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market as new financial products and solutions drive further participation.

(1M chart)

As you can see from the 1M chart, the trading volume occurred in the box section.

-
(1W chart)

As you can see from the 1W chart, the point where the volume profile section is formed is 1021.49, 2354.39.

Therefore, the key is whether it can be supported near 2354.39.

---------------------------------------------

(1D chart)

Since the HA-Low indicator of the 1D chart was formed at 2359.35, it is important to see if it can be supported around here and rise above the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator.

Therefore, it is important to see if it can rise to around 2531.05-2621.99 and maintain the price.

-
Since the StochRSI indicator is showing signs of a change in slope in the overbought zone, if it falls without being supported around 2359.35, it is necessary to check if it is supported around 2196.52.

Since ETH has fallen below the M-Signal indicator on the 1M chart, it can be seen as turning into a downtrend from a long-term perspective.

So, we need to see which way it deviates from the 2196.52-2621.99 range.

The next volatility period for ETH is around September 26th.

Three months red? It never happens. It only happened in 2022 and that's because we were dealing with a bear-market.

Then it happened again in 2018 but that is because we were dealing with a bear-market. The ensuing years, never, never three months red. It is like the launch of the spot ETFs changed the market dynamics, it changed our map.

Ok, the map changed so what?
We adapt to market conditions, that's what we do, it is not like we cannot adapt pretty easily.

Ethereum closed three months red already, something that only happened twice on this chart, in 2022 and 2018. Apart from these bear-market years, Ethereum would never close three consecutive months red let alone four or five.

Relief?

‚û¢ Since we have three months that closed red the market calls for a relief rally?
‚û¢ Since we have three months red the market must turn?
‚û¢ Since we have three months red the fourth must be bullish?

Anything can happen but we read the chart.
Three months red is a bearish signal, but relief is always necessary.

Let's look at some scenarios.

Say this month wicks down strong and closes green; that's relief.
Say this month closes red and next month (October) and the month after (November) close green; that would be a relief rally.

We can impose our beliefs on the market, saying "this must happen" or "that must happen for this or that reason," or we can read the chart, see what is actually happening and determine based on this data what is likely to happen next.

The times that Ethereum closed three months red it continued red for another six additional months. Market conditions are different now, but we can only be guided by the data on the chart.

The weekly MACD and RSI are on the bearish zone.
The monthly MACD and RSI are both trending down strong.

‚ûñ ETHUSDT Monthly RSI: 

‚ûñ ETHUSDT Monthly MACD: 
(Bearish cross in the making.)

This is the monthly chart, one candle is 720 stronger than the hourly chart.

Maybe it will grow, but I need confirmation by seeing prices going up.

As long as it is red, it is going down.

Thanks a lot for your support.

Namaste.

From where we put the red arrow on the chart, the correction of Ethereum has started.

We are now close to the discount range of the previous wave.

The movement momentum of Ethereum has decreased. We have a good range for Rebuy. From the range of the yellow circle, we expect an upward price rejection.

The targets are listed on the chart.

Closing a daily candle below the invalidation level will violate the analysis.

There is a high probability of profit taking. Possible take profit level is  2391.45 

Using a trailing stop is also a good idea!

Looks like ETH is printing an Adam & Eve Double Bottom pattern
___
Real clean bullish dragon pattern here on ETH with the daily Bullish engulfing today. 

Initially looking for the range high target at 2810. This would confirm the double bottom, and the expectations above that would be a 1.618 extension, or as high as the measured move of the double bottom. 

A break above the upper supply line would then raise the targets to 4490-4885, and as high as about 6k for a 1.618 extension of the correction. 

Breaking the local supply line, and retesting the top of the range would be a great start here.

ETH recent pump was an indication of things to come -- good things.

The coin went from 1700 to 1900 within 72 hours -- indicating that a longer shifting trend is about to materialize. Based on recent news, low supply of ETH is being detected on most exchanges depicting a bullish scenario for the coin.

On weekly data, new higher lows was created both on Histogram and pricing -- conveying the recent ascend with the current price range to be the new base for the incoming significant price growth.

Weekly data price movement volatility has been on the conservative side hinting that for every higher low it established -- it is creating a solid support range.

On Tri monthly data -- it is hinting of the same bullish continuation scenario. Surging price valuation on longer time spectrum. A bubble up volume has finally appeared after 5 months of waiting, last one was on January 2023.

Expect significant price valuation for ETH in the next coming weeks.

The weekly chart is too clean, direction is certain -- no further explanation needed.

Description

Ethereum (ETH), as a leading blockchain platform, is primed for potential investment opportunities based on its robust fundamentals:

- **Transition to Ethereum 2.0:** Ethereum's upgrade to a proof-of-stake model under Ethereum 2.0 aims to significantly increase its transaction speed and decrease energy consumption, potentially boosting its attractiveness and value.
- **Widespread Adoption:** Ethereum's platform is the foundation for numerous decentralized applications (dApps), including those in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which could drive further demand and increase the value of ETH.
- **Institutional Interest:** Increasing interest and investment in Ethereum by institutional investors can provide more stability and growth potential for ETH.
- **Network Improvements:** Ongoing improvements and protocol enhancements continue to solve issues such as high gas fees and network congestion, making Ethereum more user-friendly and scalable.

Given these developments, buying ETH could be a strategic move for investors looking to benefit from its core strengths and long-term growth potential in the blockchain ecosystem.

How to Use Z-Score for Smarter Trading Strategies 

In trading, success often depends on your ability to predict market movements and manage your capital efficiently. One of the tools that can give traders an edge is the Z-score, a statistical measure that helps identify patterns in win and loss streaks. This article breaks down what the Z-score is, how it works in trading, and how you can use it to optimize your strategies.

 What is Z-Score in Trading? 

In simple terms, Z-score measures the distance between an observed outcome (like a win or loss) and the average result in a set of data. In the context of trading, this data set typically represents your wins and losses over time. The Z-score is most commonly found in the range of -3 to +3, with higher scores indicating a greater probability of consecutive wins followed by losses, and lower scores representing more random, unpredictable outcomes.

 A high Z-score suggests that your trading strategy is likely to go through a series of wins, followed by a series of losses . This information can help you adjust your capital allocation and manage risk better. Conversely, a low Z-score points to a more chaotic trading environment where wins and losses alternate with little predictability.

 How Z-Score Can Improve Your Trading Decisions 

1 ‚Ä¢  Understanding Random vs. Strategic Trading 

Traders who act without a strategy tend to experience unpredictable results ‚Äî one win here, one loss there. This type of trading is driven by randomness and typically has a low Z-score, meaning there is no clear pattern of consecutive wins or losses.

On the other hand, traders who use strategic approaches ‚Äî like the ones developed by SOFEX ‚Äîtend to see more predictable outcomes. These strategies often have a higher Z-score, signaling that you can expect a string of wins, followed by a string of losses.

2 ‚Ä¢  Capital Management Based on Z-Score 

The Z-score provides crucial insights into when to adjust your capital. The general rule of thumb is:

‚Ä¢ After a streak of wins, reduce your capital. The Z-score indicates that a loss is likely to follow after a series of wins.
‚Ä¢ After a loss or streak of losses, increase your capital, as a win is statistically more likely to follow.

For example, if you start with $1,000 and win multiple times in a row, your first instinct might be to increase your capital to $2,000 or even $3,000.  However, this is where most traders make a critical mistake .
Based on the Z-score model, it's better to decrease your capital after consecutive wins, as losses are statistically imminent. Conversely, increase your capital after a loss to benefit from the upcoming win streak.

3 ‚Ä¢  Avoid Overconfidence After Wins 

Traders often fall into the trap of increasing their stake after a series of wins, assuming that the market will continue to favor them. However, the Z-score suggests that after 3-5 wins, you should lower your risk and decrease the amount you're trading. By doing so, you protect your profits from the losses that typically follow a winning streak.

4 ‚Ä¢  How to Apply This in Practice 

Let‚Äôs walk through a typical trading scenario:

You start with $1,000.
You win multiple trades, so you might be tempted to increase your capital.  However, if you understand the Z-score, you‚Äôll know that after several wins, a loss is likely coming soon . Instead of increasing capital, reduce your stake, say, to $500 or $800.
When the inevitable loss comes, you‚Äôve minimized your risk.
After this loss, you can now increase your capital back to $1,500 or $2,000, as the Z-score suggests that a win streak is more probable after a loss.

By following this approach, you avoid major losses after a win streak, and you‚Äôre well-positioned to capitalize on the next string of wins.

 Key Takeaways for Traders 

‚Ä¢ Z-score predicts patterns in trading, with high Z-scores indicating win streaks followed by losses, and low Z-scores indicating a more random, unpredictable pattern.
‚Ä¢ After consecutive wins, lower your capital to protect your profits, as losses are statistically likely to follow.
‚Ä¢ After consecutive losses, increase your capital to take advantage of the upcoming win streak.

Managing your capital based on Z-score predictions allows you to minimize losses and maximize profits, even during market fluctuations.

 Final Thoughts 

Trading is as much about managing risk as it is about making profits. The Z-score strategy can help traders anticipate win and loss streaks, allowing them to adjust their capital allocation more effectively. By following this model, you can protect yourself from large losses and make smarter decisions about when to scale up or down your trades.

 In summary, to optimize your trading:
‚Ä¢ Lower capital after multiple wins to avoid large losses.
‚Ä¢ Increase capital after losses to take advantage of win streaks. 

Implementing these strategies based on the Z-score will not only improve your trading outcomes but also help you build long-term, sustainable profitability.

So the next time you're riding a win streak, remember: it's not the time to increase your stake‚Äîit's time to strategically lower it and lock in your profits.

According to our opinion, Ethereum has penetrated the floor of $900 and the purchase order has been cleared at this price level.

From above, it has hit its daily true zone QM and after the start of its downward rally, it has cleared its FL or local resistance and is correcting an upward price and starting the next downward step.


Liquidity below the weekly long-term trend line confirms this.

We move step by step with the price....

Ethereum (ETH) has successfully risen above the 200 EMA on the 4 hour Chart for the first time since July. signaling a potential bullish reversal. This critical indicator often marks a shift in market sentiment, and ETH's current price action suggests we could see significant upward movement.

Currently, ETH is facing a key resistance zone between $2500 and $2600. A breakout above this level could unleash further bullish momentum, with the next target to watch being $3000, which could be within reach as momentum builds. As we monitor this potential breakout, it's important to keep an eye on volume and momentum for confirmation, as a strong push through resistance will strengthen the bullish case.

Always keep stop loss!!

Hey there, ‚úå 
Ethereum has encountered corrections from the key resistance level of $2700 in the long-term time frame. Currently, the price reacted around $2200 and managed to experience positive movements toward the $2500 zone, as highlighted in recent analyses. However, mid-term analysis still indicates a bearish trend, with the price ranging at the $2300 level.
 
In the mid-term, it's anticipated that Ethereum may approach the $1800 zone through some corrections. Upon reaching this level, market reaction will be crucial in understanding the future movement.

Key resistance zones at the moment lie between $2500 and $2700. On the other hand, if the price breaks and holds above $2700, we might see further upward movement toward $3000 to $3200 

This analysis is my personal viewpoint and not financial advice. If you found this helpful, please like and comment ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! Happy trading! ‚úåüòä

Ethereum is looking to breakout, however it will probably follow BTC with its price action. I would set take profit targets at the 3 resistance levels, to see a breakout to above 3000, we need to first see breakout of these resistance levels, so set some take profit on these 3 prices (or just in those ranges) to re-enter at a lower price if we get rejected. Good luck

There has been a price forming a triangle on the chart for a long time.

The downtrend channel forming the top of the triangle indicates the most critical region for a price breakout. For now, it seems like there is still time to reach that point. It may be a bit early to think that a rise will happen soon before this downtrend channel is broken.

At the same time, the support channel forming the lower part of the triangle appears to be a healthy zone for accumulation. In other words, for long-term investors, as long as this green box is not broken downwards, it seems like a buying zone.

However, we can't know how close the movement can get to the end of the triangle or how long it will take to break it. It just seems to need a little more time.

The recent Federal Reserve rate cuts sent ripples through the financial markets, sparking a rally in both the US stock market and the cryptocurrency realm. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two titans of crypto, were among the beneficiaries, experiencing significant price increases.

While many investors approached this bullish surge with caution, a wave of optimism for Ethereum was brewing at the TOKEN 2049 conference. Influencers and experts alike expressed their belief that Ethereum's price could outperform Bitcoin in the next bull market.

Intrigued by this potential, let's explore some possible scenarios for Ethereum's journey and how you might capitalize on them:

Scenario 1: A Bullish Breakaway
If Ethereum's price continues to climb and breaks through the first resistance level of $2,800, we could see a period of accumulation before the next leg up. However, a more explosive move, surpassing the $3,400 mark, would signal a strong bullish reversal and present a prime opportunity to enter Ethereum.

Scenario 2: A Temporary Dip
On the other hand, if the rally loses momentum and Ethereum's price falls below the $2,200 support level, a deeper drop to $1,980 could be on the horizon. However, if the price forms a higher low above $2,200, it would indicate a strengthening of the support level and could offer a lucrative buying opportunity at a discounted price.

As with any investment, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before making any decisions. The future of Ethereum is filled with uncertainty, but the potential rewards are significant. Stay informed, analyze the market, and seize the opportunities that may arise.

Looking right now at the candles, we are still seeing pressure from sellers and for ETH to see any kind of bullish momentum here, buyers need to secure that dotted line (orange one).

Ethereum is trading around $2,368, attempting to rebound from the lower boundary of a descending channel. The price has respected the support zone between $2,150 and $2,250, which is marked by the brown shaded area on the chart.

The red-shaded area between $4,000 and $4,600 is the major resistance zone. A breakout above this zone would be a strong bullish signal, potentially leading to a continuation towards higher levels.

 Key support is currently at the brown zone between $2,150 and $2,250. A failure to hold this level could result in Ethereum testing lower support of around $2,000 or potentially the channel's lower trendline.

 A successful hold above the current support and a break above the descending resistance trendline could see Ethereum targeting $3,000 and beyond. Positive signals from momentum indicators would further confirm a bullish trend continuation.

 If Ethereum fails to maintain its position above the current support and falls back into the descending channel, it could retest the lower support zone around $2,150. A further breakdown below this level might open the path towards $2,000 or lower.

 Ethereum is showing a potential rebound from key support, but confirmation of a breakout above the descending trendline is needed for a bullish continuation. Keep an eye on momentum indicators and broader market conditions for further clues.

The weekly chart of ETH/USDT shows a strong ascending trendline support that has been respected over the past several months.
The price is currently testing this trendline support near the $2,300 level, suggesting a potential bounce from this key support area.
The primary support level is the ascending trendline around $2,000 to $2,300. Holding this level is crucial for maintaining the bullish structure.
 A major resistance zone is highlighted between $4,200 and $5,000. This area has acted as a significant supply zone in the past and is likely to be a major obstacle to further upward movement.

If ETH can hold above the trendline support and gain momentum, a potential rally toward the $4,200 to $5,000 resistance zone could occur. This would align with the chart's upward arrow, indicating optimism for a continued upward move.
 If the price fails to hold the support and breaks below the trendline, we might see a deeper correction, potentially testing lower supports around $1,700 to $2,000.

A weekly close above $2,400 with increased volume would provide a strong bullish confirmation, suggesting a higher probability of testing the $4,200-$5,000 resistance zone.
Monitoring RSI, MACD, or other momentum indicators on the weekly timeframe could provide additional confirmation of a potential trend reversal or continuation.

The presence of a large upward arrow on the chart indicates a bullish sentiment, expecting a rebound from the current levels.
Broader market conditions, Bitcoin's price action, and macroeconomic factors will also play significant roles in ETH's price trajectory.

Traders should consider setting stop-loss orders below the ascending trendline or the $2,000 level to manage downside risk effectively.
Regularly review and adjust positions based on evolving market conditions and price actions near key levels.
This weekly update outlines the critical levels and scenarios for ETH/USDT, highlighting the importance of the ascending trendline support for the continuation of the bullish outlook. Watch for confirmation signals and stay aware of market influences that could affect ETH's performance.

Hey Realistic Traders,  let's dive into the technical analysis of  BINANCE:ETHUSDT   

In the H4 timeframe, the price stubbornly stays below the EMA100,  reinforcing the strong bearish trend we've been watching . A rising wedge pattern had formed, but recently, the price took a dive, breaking out of that pattern with high trading volume‚Äînever a good sign for the bulls. Adding fuel to the fire, the MACD has made a bearish crossover, with the MACD line slipping below the signal line, signaling that the downward momentum is picking up steam.

With all these technical indicators lining up, we‚Äôre eyeing a potential continuation of this downward journey toward Target Area 1 at 2,252.90 or even Target Area 2 at 2,073.77. However, bulls might find some hope   if the price manages to break above the resistance level at 2,855.96.

Hello everyone,
ETHUSDT is currently holding on to a long-standing trendline that has provided consistent support over time. The price has bounced off this trendline multiple times, but the recent repeated dips to $2093 and $2150 have created a scenario where further pressure could potentially lead to a break below this support. The significant drop in volume raises concerns about a possible downward move. For ETH to avoid breaking this key support, it would need to rally and break and give weekly closing above the resistance level at $2535, which could signal a reversal of the current downtrend. 
If the trendline breaks, the below support zones will likely come into play.

Upper support zone:
SUPPORT ZONE= $1695 to $1827

ETH: Bearish Pattern Remains Intact

Ethereum has respected our previous analysis and reached the first target. 
Today, we observe a larger contracting triangle pattern, indicating the potential for further downward movement.

 With the release of the ADP data today, market speculation is expected to be high.  
It is possible that ETH may test the $2,500 level again before moving down, but it could also decline from the current market price.


 You may find more details in the chart!
Thank you and Good Luck!

Note -
One of the best forms of Price Action is to not try to predict at all. Instead of that, ACT on the price. So, this chart tells at "where" to act in "what direction. Unless it triggers, like, let's say the candle doesn't break the level which says "Buy if it breaks", You should not buy at all.
=======
I use shorthands for my trades.
"Positional" - means You can carry these positions and I do not see sharp volatility ahead. (I tally upcoming events and many small kinds of stuff to my own tiny capacity.)
"Intraday" -means You must close this position at any cost by the end of the day.
"Theta" , "Bounce" , "3BB" or "Entropy" - My own systems.
=======
I won't personally follow any rules. If I "think" (It is never gut feel. It is always some reason.) the trade is wrong, I may take reverse trade. I may carry forward an intraday position. What is meant here - You shouldn't follow me because I may miss updating. You should follow the system I share.
=======
Like -
Always follow a stop loss.
In the case of Intraday trades, it is mostly the "Day's High".
In the case of Positional trades, it is mostly the previous swings.
I do not use Stop Loss most of the time. But I manage my risk with options as I do most of the trades using derivatives

Data from cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment has revealed that so called ‚ÄòShark‚Äô addresses on the Ethereum blockchain have over the past year stockpiled over $6.2 billion worth of the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization.these addresses are defined as those holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH, or between $17,500 or $17.5 million worth of the cryptocurrency, and their supply has grown by 554,000 ETH in the past week, according to the platform‚Äôs data.

Meanwhile, however, while ETH sharks have been accumulating heavily, whales on the network have ‚Äúcollectively dumped 9.4 million in the same timeframe.‚Äù These whales are defined as addresses holding between 10,000 and 10 million ETH, meaning from $17.5 million to $17.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. crypto forums are paying close attention to the various banking crises occurring globally. The company notes that ‚Äúlaws and policies going forward may have a dramatic impact on the trajectory of cryptocurrency‚Äù.

Notably, Ethereum is set to undergo its highly-anticipated Shanghai-Capella upgrade, often referred to as Shapella, upgrade on April 12. The upgrade includes one key feature, with Ethereum Improvement Proposal, EIP 4895 will allow for withdrawals of staked Ether on the network, a functionality that wasn‚Äôt implemented when the network merged with the Beacon Chain and transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus.the upgrade will also feature three other improvements aimed at optimizing gas costs for certain activities. The upgrade is set to take place on April 12 at epoch number 620,9536. Shapella is coming after multiple phases of public testing on three testnets, including Sepolia, Zhejiang, and Goerli. The upgrade was earlier this week deployed on the Goerli testnet as a final rehearsal ahead of the mainnet launch.

The price of Ethereum is $1,820 today with a 24hour trading volume of 14 billion dollar. This represents a 5% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 27% price increase in the past 7 days

next targets are 1830, 1840 and 1850$

üìä#ETH There are still goals to achieve, cautious bearish ‚ö†Ô∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, we have constructed a double-bottom bullish structure near the buying zone. We have now reached the overlapping area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe periodic resistance zone and the downward trend line. It is reasonable to fall back when encountering resistance. However, the most ideal bull target area can still be expected. Before the double bottom structure is destroyed, please be cautious in going short.

___
Ethereum has reached a very important zone where price has now reached the lower zone of upward trend (where also 200EMA is acting as a support).

Now ideally we should see a good bounce from here and a movement to the upper zone or at least that middle line of Bollinger bands (which is in bearish trend currently).

So we wait for a propper bounce to happen from here but bear in mind. Overall market conditions are not looking good so if everything goes against our plans, then a good downward movement will happen (if the EMA zone will be secured by sellers).

ETH has touched an important support zone.

Therefore, the key is whether it can receive support near 2159.0.

If it falls below 2159.0, you should check whether there is support near 1605.23-1783.0.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

The real uptrend is expected to start when it rises above 29K.

The next expected range to touch is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23

5th: 178910.15

These are points that are likely to receive resistance in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this range is touched because it is thought that a new trend can be created in the overshooting range.

That's a bullish perspective if eth will follow these steps, first to take SC, so first of all price will go a little bit lower than last LH.
After that we have to follow market what we will, I would expect to go higher as on chart, to take out SOS(B), that would confirm Weekly Demand zone.

Result: 
It's been  21 hours  since I posted the  BINANCE:ETHUSDT   analysis. The price of ETH is moving back and forth, fluctuating between the  2300 and 2400  range, and there have been  5 trading opportunities  since then.

 Difficulty Review: 
 
 1st and 2nd one are harder because they bounce the price from the 2350.
 The other 3 are easier, and we should aim to nail them.
 

 The future: 
If it break 2100, the long term price will change from Long to neutral, lets see.


 Trade safe! Sleep well! Play Hard!
Have a good weekend!

ETH has bounced off a significant support zone near 2,100-2,300 USD (brown-shaded area). This zone has previously acted as a strong support and the price seems to have respected it once again.
ETH is currently trading around 2,548 USD, showing a strong upward movement with a recent breakout above a descending trendline.
Resistance and Support:

The red-shaded area at the top of the chart, between 3,800-4,200 USD, is a major resistance zone. This level has previously rejected ETH, so breaking through this area will be key for further upside momentum.
Support is clearly defined around the 2,100 USD mark, which ETH has bounced off multiple times.
 The yellow moving average suggests a potential shift toward a bullish trend, with price action starting to close above it.
ETH has broken above a descending resistance trendline, indicating a potential bullish reversal.

Based on the arrow in the chart, the projection suggests a bullish run toward the 3,200-3,800 USD range if ETH continues this momentum. However, it will face key resistances of around 2,800 USD and 3,050 USD before challenging the upper resistance zone.
The chart suggests a positive outlook for ETH, as long as it maintains support above the 2,400 USD level. If momentum continues, it could retest key resistance levels higher up.

üìä#ETH reaches the target area ‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural point of view, we have constructed a bullish double bottom structure near the buying zone. Currently, the goal of this structure has been achieved. We need to be wary of the risk of a pullback and do not chase the rise under selling pressure.

‚û°Ô∏èBreaking through the neckline 2463, which means that a larger double bottom long structure is established, and the general trend direction is still a bull trend, so the main focus is on long positions.

Hello friends,

In late 2021, Ethereum ( BINANCE:ETHUSDT ) reached an all-time high of approximately $4,900 before experiencing a significant correction, dropping around 80% to a low of $880. Since that dip, ETH has been consistently making higher highs and higher lows, suggesting a potential long-term bullish trend.
I'm focusing on these key levels as important points for any macro cycle movement:

 Pivot Points High Low Levels: 
HH: $4,100 (Near ATH)
HH: $2,700 (Previous resistance)
HH/LL: $2,100 (Critical pivot)
LL: $1,500
LL: $880 (2022 low)

 Bollinger Bands Analysis : 
Currently, ETH is within the lower Bollinger Band, indicating a potential oversold condition. Historically, this has been a favorable zone for accumulation, as the price may revert to the mean once the selling pressure eases.

 Potential Scenarios: 
 
 Bullish Case:
The most critical level to watch is $2,700. A decisive break above this level could pave the way for ETH to challenge the psychologically important $3,000 mark. If ETH can establish $3,000 as support, it would confirm a higher high and potentially signal the start of a new macro bull cycle.
 Consolidation Case:
ETH may continue to trade between the $2,100 support and $2,700 resistance, forming a tightening range. This consolidation could set the stage for a significant move once resolved.
 Bearish Case:
A failure to hold above $2,100 could lead to a retest of lower support levels. However, as long as ETH maintains its pattern of higher lows, the long-term bullish structure remains intact.
 

 Conclusion: 
The $3,000 level appears to be the key for initiating a potential macro bull cycle. Accumulation near the lower Bollinger Band could be a strategic move for those bullish on ETH's long-term prospects.

 Risk Management: 
Consider using the $2,100 level as a potential stop-loss for long positions, as a break below this level could invalidate the bullish thesis.


Happy Trading!

On the daily chart for ETH/USDT, we can observe a clear corrective pattern unfolding, with a likely formation of an extended WXYXZ correction. Currently, the price is showing signs of completing wave (Y), and we may soon see a final leg down towards the completion of wave (Z). Based on the projection of the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, the critical support level lies near $1,920, which also coincides with previous demand zones.

If this key level holds, we could expect a reversal from this region, potentially igniting a strong upward momentum. The 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level around $1,750 serves as another critical confluence point, suggesting that this area could provide a robust foundation for a bullish reversal.

Should ETH respect these support zones, it could mark the beginning of a new impulsive structure, leading to higher highs in the upcoming months. While the near-term trend remains bearish, the long-term perspective offers a promising opportunity for buyers if key support levels are respected.

Ethereum has completed the upside potential and is overbought and now a correction is needed, big moves and big traps are coming.

Ethereum has done a small rejection but yet nothing clear for us. 

Despite the fact that we had a nice rejection so far, we are looking here for a possible further downward movement to happen but this can happen only if sellers manage to secure the current zone fully. 

So we are keeping an eye on the current zone, so far looking not that bad at all!

Another day for Ethereum and we see first signs of weakness here on the daily timeframe.

Going long on Ethereum (ETH) near $2,100 offers a favorable risk-reward setup:

Support at $2,100: This level has shown strong buying interest, making it a potential base for a long position.
Risk Management: Set a tight stop-loss slightly below support, around $2,050‚Äì$2,000, to minimize downside risk.
Upside Potential: If the support holds, ETH could bounce towards higher resistance levels, offering a solid reward compared to the risk.

Key factors to monitor: overall market sentiment, BTC correlation, and ETH-specific news (network upgrades or regulations).
___
Probably the price will return to the 2500 area, in this area we have Fibonacci 0.5 and 0.618, which is likely to reject the price to the $1900 area.
___
The chart depicts a descending channel, with ETH/USDT currently trading near the lower boundary of the channel, which has historically acted as a support level.
ETH is approaching a key horizontal support zone around $2,100-$2,200, where buyers may look for entry opportunities.


The major support zone lies between $2,100 and $2,200, as highlighted on the chart. This level aligns with the lower trendline of the broader ascending trend from the past year, suggesting a confluence of support.
 Immediate resistance is located between $2,800 and $3,000. A further resistance zone is identified around the $4,000-$4,600 range, which corresponds to a previous major supply area.

The chart suggests a bullish scenario where ETH could initially rebound from the current support area, targeting the $2,800-$3,000 resistance zone.
A breakout above the descending channel and subsequent resistance zone would indicate a stronger bullish continuation, potentially targeting the higher resistance at $4,000-$4,600.

The presence of the large upward arrow on the chart reflects optimism for a bullish bounce within the identified zones.
Continuation of the broader uptrend depends on maintaining support levels and breaking through key resistance zones with momentum.
This update suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for ETH/USDT with clear levels to watch for bullish confirmation and risk management considerations. Keeping an eye on volume and price action around these critical zones will be crucial for confirming the next major move.

ETH/USDT has been in a downtrend since peaking at around $4,600, with lower highs and lower lows forming a descending pattern.
The current price is near the significant support zone around $2,100, which is crucial for maintaining the bullish structure.

The key support is at $2,100, a historically significant zone that has acted as support during prior market corrections.
 The immediate resistance to watch is around $3,000, a previous support zone that has turned into resistance. A move above this level could lead to further bullish momentum towards the next resistance near $3,800.

A strong bounce from the $2,100 support, potentially leading to a test of the $3,000 resistance. A break above this resistance could target higher levels around $3,800.
Failure to hold the $2,100 support may trigger a deeper decline towards the next support zone around $1,800, or possibly lower if selling pressure intensifies.
Pattern Observation:

The chart suggests a potential double-bottom formation around the $2,100 level, which could indicate a bullish reversal if confirmed by a breakout above the neckline resistance at $3,000.
The presence of a descending triangle pattern also hints at a bearish continuation if the price fails to break above the key resistance.
Volume and Indicators:

Volume analysis will be crucial; an increase in buying volume at the support level would strengthen the case for a reversal.
Oscillators like RSI near oversold conditions would support a potential bounce, while MACD bullish crossovers could confirm a trend change.

For a bullish outlook, setting stop-loss levels just below the $2,100 support is advisable to mitigate downside risk.
A bearish strategy would involve short positions on a confirmed breakdown of the $2,100 level, targeting lower support zones.
This analysis suggests that ETH is at a pivotal support level, where a potential reversal could occur if buying interest increases. Monitoring key levels and volume will provide further insights into the next likely move.

First of all, I should state that I expect Bitcoin dominance to rise to the 60%-62% range and Bitcoin usually falls in september.
If Bitcoin will fall and at the same time its dominance will rise that's means we may see a strong downtrend in altcoins.

Ethereum has completed its Elliot 5 wave pattern from the bottom and and still in the correction waves. And I think a second wave Elliott correction is needed in the longer term uptrend.

Afterwards, I think 2025 could be a very good year the market and there might be a chance to sell at good prices in 2026.

After the hype around the approval of spot ETFs, we saw an impulsive spike in May 2024. Many traders interpreted this as a signal for aggressive buying, but it turned out to be a bull trap, with each correction used for accumulation.

Let‚Äôs look at the chart from a technical perspective:

Hello everyone,
Let's analyze ETHUSDT in weekly timeframe!!

ETHUSDT is currently forming a bullish pennant structure and maintaining strong trendline support. It is trading above the 200 MA, which is expected to act as a crucial support level.
RSI: Crossover in oversold zone.

There are two possible outcomes based on ETH price predictions:

Scenario 1:
ETH may bounce from the support range of $1996.59 to $2226.50, followed by an initial drop of approximately 7-10%.

Scenario 2:
ETH could break and fall through the upper support zone of $1996.59 to $2226.50 and decline toward the lower support zone of $1079.39 to $1251.48. A bounce from this lower support could occur only if ETH breaks the above zone, though this scenario is less likely due to the potential 50% decline from the current price, especially considering current market sentiment and cryptocurrency adoption trends.

BUYING ZONE:

Upper support zone:
$1996.59 to $2226.50

Lower support zone:
$1079.39 to $1251.48

üìâ At Daily Timeframe The Main Structure Is ABC, And Currently The Price Playing At The Wave 5 From C, I Expect a Breakdown The 2300$ Support Toward a 1670$ As a Main Target For This Boring Correction

üëâ I Know It‚Äôs Hard To Accept Bearish Scenarios For Any Coins And Index But Its Better To Trust The Charts, The Whole Market Structure Is Bearish And The Main Thing Is If BTC Goes -5% ETH Goes -7% And Most Of Alts Goes -15%, So It‚Äôs Better To Be Out Of The Market During This Period

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  

Notice: The points are only valid from 2024/09/06 to 2024/09/26

 What we have now? 
1.The key support and resistances level:
 
 2820
 2600
 2400
 2305
 2110
 


 What should we do? 
1. For Future traders 
Open the long position when the price fails to break through the lower support level

TP when the price is close to upper resistance level or TP 50% of your position first, the other 50% for a huge breakout.
SL when the price break through the lower support level and -5% ROI of your asset

Open the short position when the price fails to break through the upper resistance level 

TP when the price is close to lower support level or TP 50% of your position first, the other 50% for a huge breakout.
SL when the price break through the upper resistance level and -5% ROI of your asset

When should we close the positions?
8 hours trend is much easier to catch than 24 hours trend, better close it as long as it reach to the support and resistance level.

2. Spot trader
The approach of spot traders is similar to the one mentioned above.

3. Holder 
Forget everything I said.

Always put a Stop Loss for your positions!! Trade safe!
___
Ethereum is teasing that lower zone, which could result in a nice break of structure. 

We are keeping a close eye on this zone after seeing a successful rejection from the upper resistance zone so now all eyes are on that BOS zone. 

Upon breaking it, we should see a decline to $2125.

Swallow Team
___
Another day and since yesterdays push, we are seeing the demand for lower zones. 

Sellers are still dominating current zones and candles are not getting as healthy green bodies as they should. 

Our gameplan is leaning right now more towards the further downward movement after reaching the support zone and possibly breaking it so eyes open!

Technical Analysis: 

 1. Current Price Below EMAs: 
 
 The price is currently trading below the EMAs, signaling a bearish sentiment. This alignment suggests that the bears are in control, with momentum pushing the price lower.
 The bearish structure is reinforced by the fact that the price broke and retested a key support level, now acting as resistance. This indicates a strong bearish momentum as the price struggles to reclaim the $2,950 level.
 

 2. Key Levels to Watch: 
 
 Bearish Scenario:  The next significant support level to watch is around $2,220. This zone has previously acted as a major liquidity area, and the price could be drawn towards it. A bounce at this level is possible, especially since this zone aligns with a high liquidity level that may attract buyers.
 Potential Bounce:  There is also the possibility of a rebound at the current price level, as it sits at the bottom of the channel. Traders should be aware of the potential for a short-term bullish move if buyers step in to defend this level.
 Bullish Scenario:  For the price to turn bullish, it needs to break above $2,950 and create a structure break (higher high). If the price manages to break this resistance, the next target would be around $3,900.
 

 3. Momentum and Crossover: 
 
 The momentum is currently below the zero line, which adds to the bearish outlook in the short term. However, if momentum begins to shift upwards, it could act as a signal of a potential reversal.
 

 4. Bearish vs. Bullish Outlook: 
 
 Bearish:  As the price remains below the EMAs, the bearish outlook remains dominant. Traders should watch for a retest of $2,220, where a potential bounce could occur.
 Bullish:  To shift to a bullish scenario, the price needs to break above the $2,950 resistance. Confirmation of a higher high would strengthen the case for a rally toward $3,900.
 

 5. Conclusion: 
 
 ETH/USDT is currently in a bearish structure, with the price sitting below the EMAs and facing resistance at $2,950. The next significant support level is $2,220, which could attract buying interest.
 However, a potential rebound from the current price level is possible as the price approaches the lower boundary of the range. Traders should monitor the key levels of $2,950 for a potential breakout to the upside or $2,220 for a possible bounce off the support. Momentum indicators also suggest a bearish continuation unless a shift in momentum occurs.

üìä#ETH Bullish Head and Shoulders Structure‚ùì

üß†From a structural perspective, we can see that an obvious bearish cup-and-handle structure has been established, but we need to note that this structure is established within the buying zone of the large cycle, so its effectiveness needs to be verified.

‚û°Ô∏èJudging from today‚Äôs structural evolution, we have the opportunity to build a bullish head and shoulders structure in the buy zone. If this structure holds true, the bearish cup-and-handle structure will fail.

‚û°Ô∏è So if you followed my point of view to go short yesterday, then it is reasonable for you to lock in the main profits before looking forward to more. We did not participate in the short transaction of ETH because we have already done the short transaction of BTC, and their transaction logic is similar.

___
The updated chart for Ethereum (ETH) against Tether (USDT) in the 4-hour timeframe shows potential for a bullish scenario. Here's the analysis based on the chart:

 The price is currently within a falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern, where price action is making lower highs and lower lows within converging trendlines. This pattern often signals a potential upward breakout.

The price is currently testing the lower boundary of the falling wedge near a significant support zone between $2,335 and $2,455. This area is crucial as it has acted as support in the past and is currently being retested.
Immediate resistance lies at the upper boundary of the wedge around $2,455 to $2,505. A breakout above this level could lead to a bullish continuation towards the next resistance around $2,800 to $2,900.
Projected Movement:

The chart suggests a potential bullish breakout from the falling wedge pattern. The arrow indicates a move upward toward the upper resistance zone near $2,800 if the breakout occurs.
A close above the resistance zone would confirm the breakout and could initiate a new bullish phase targeting higher levels.
Key Levels to Watch:

A close below the lower boundary of the wedge or the support zone could invalidate the bullish setup, leading to further downside. Conversely, a strong breakout above the wedge could signal a bullish reversal.
The current setup suggests watching for a confirmed breakout above the wedge for a long opportunity. If the price maintains support and breaks above resistance, there could be a significant upward movement towards higher targets.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.

Hi everyone, 

I have been studying ICT lately and practicing into charts mainly BTC and ETH. Not yet trading with actual money tho, as I hit a wall in my trading journey couple of months ago and just started studying again. Hoping to get positive feedbacks as to my ICT knowledge from here on. 

ETH for daily chart,
as we can see here, ETH has been trading in the discount area for quite some time clearing FVGs in the lower time frame. The wick of today's candle bounced right into our displacement low and my invalidation area for bullish scenario. If we zoom out we can see that ETH has been forming lower highs recently that's why I placed my invalidation in that area. 

If we manage to clear past the range high, hoping we see ETH clear up also the SIBI in the Daily timeframe, then I feel very positive for ETH going in the upside. But first we need to clear the SIBI, at least enter in the equilibrium so it will feel a little more positive for ETH.

That's it everyone, kindly correct me if I am wrong as I am still in the learning process in my trading journey. üôÇ üìàüìàüìàüöÄ

üìä#ETH Bearish Cup and Handle Structureüìâ

üß†From a structural perspective From a structural perspective, we successfully constructed a bearish cup-and-handle structure after falling below the neckline of 2397.23. The ideal target area for this structure is 2078-2200. However, this structure is built in the buying zone of a large cycle, and I am not sure whether it can achieve its ideal goal.

üìàCurrently we are near the neckline resistance of 2397.23. If we fall from here to near the support area to build an hour-level long structure, then there is a high probability that we will not reach the ideal target area of ‚Äã‚Äã2078-2200.

üìâIf we rise directly to the inflection point resistance area, then the probability of us continuing to fall will be higher. Unless we can break through the short defense point, we should not be too optimistic.

The resistance zone that has been holding Ethereum back from bullish movement has rejected one more time the price, leading to a nice 9% decline from there. 

We still have some more room to fall here so keep eyes on that lower target zone.

Swallow Team
___
Ethereum is getting closer and closer to our support zone, where price has dropped so far by 9% since yesterday. 

We are waiting for further movement to lower zones to happen here and once we see the price  hover near that support zone, we will be looking for a price reaction to that zone!

Swallow Team
___
We have entered the liquidity zone and now Ethereum has shown a strong buying reaction. We are moving in a wide range, therefore, long entry at prices of 2300 with the goal of growth to 2600. After that, I think the fall to the values ‚Äã‚Äãof 2000 will continue

Will $2,200 be a fair price for  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  ?‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì

Ethereum is now struggling with $2,400 zone. If this zone fails with unfavourable crypto fundamentals? we may see  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  drop to $2.2k


As I will always say, risk management is king.
___
While Ethereum is the second biggest Cryptocurrency, it is still an altcoin. Anything can happen within this market.

We already know of the bullish potential and capacity for this and other projects to grow.
We know these are great companies and the future of money, finance, but, we are witnessing a correction now and therefore we have to consider the bearish side. How far down can it go?

Once the correction is over we go back to the bullish potential and how high can it go.

Ethereum underperformed the market recently. This can be due to the fact that it has been growing since June 2022, while others hit bottom in mid to late 2023. 

The weekly MACD shows a strong, more than three years old bearish divergence. It shows the worst conditions and reading since January 2022, when the last bear-market started to gain full force: 

The first baseline level has been compromised. Looking at the weekly timeframe, it is easy to see how much more room there is available for prices to move lower.

The "new baseline," the price at which Ethereum traded around October 2023, the level preceding the last bullish impulse, is the next target. This range goes between $1,750 and $1,550.

The weekly RSI is already bearish, showing an almost 4 years long bearish divergence, and already lost its last support before a full-breakdown. 

Right now the most worrying fact are the Ethereum Spot ETFs; the want in, they went big and they want to buy between $1,000 and $1,200. This would be the level at which ETHUSDT traded around November 2022. I know this sounds really low but some altcoins are already there and right now Ethereum is just an altcoin and it underperformed the market recently (a sign of weakness).

I think the next target is the "new baseline," but I am prepared for all scenarios just in case. It is amazing how fast everything can really change. One day we are relaxed looking at our computers and having fun in every way, the next day we have a crash and prices go much lower than any thought possible the previous day. This is how the markets work, they tend to produce sudden events that we never thought possible. The chart shows the tendency and the market follows with events that confirm and justify what the chart shows.

After the correction is over, we will have a new growth phase and Ethereum can easy go above $10,000, but first we have to see how far down it can go.

We only have a few months left for the entire correction and bottom to settle. After this, we are back on the positive and we think solely about LONG, up and green.

Namaste.

ETH Weakens Below 2460 

After an impulsive bearish wave that began on August 24 near 2818, the price has been forming a bearish ‚ÄúContracting Triangle Pattern.‚Äù

Today, the price broke out from this bearish pattern and is expected to continue moving downward. The 2460 price zone, which was crucial for the bulls, has now turned into resistance. It appears that bearish sentiment is growing.

The first support level is near 2390, which also serves as a short-term target.

Additional targets where the price may pause are found near 2332 and 2207.

 You may find more details in the chart!
Thank you and Good Luck!

Here is the daily chart of Ethereum (ETH) against Tether (USDT), with a focus on a potential short scenario. The analysis based on the chart is as follows:

The chart shows a clear descending trend with lower highs and lower lows, indicating bearish momentum in the market.
The price is currently near a key support area of around $2,360, highlighted by the brown horizontal area. This support area has been tested multiple times and is crucial for the next price action.
 there is a resistance area near $2,800, which has previously acted as a supply area, which could potentially limit any immediate bullish rally.

A breakdown from a small ascending wedge or consolidation pattern appears, indicating further bearish pressure.
 The chart shows a possible rebound from the current support zone, but with overall bearish pressure, the broader movement may remain downward until the price breaks above the resistance.
 Below is a long-term ascending trendline, which could act as a key support level if the current support fails.

 the short-term scenario remains bearish, with a short-term bounce likely from current levels. However, the general bias suggests caution, as the breakdown from the recent consolidation points to a risk of continued declines unless key resistance levels are broken.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.

___
For the last week, the price of Ethereum has held nicely the broken zone, which has now turned into a resistance zone.

We have seen multiple rejections so far and sellers are not giving back that zone to buyers, which gives a possibility of further movement to lower zones here. 

Swallow Team
___
Ethereum buyers have been suppressed by sellers, where we see that yesterday's green candle has seen a rejection and now is back in the hands of sellers. 

We are looking here more at Bollinger Bands, where the gap has been normalised after it was exploded wide open (thanks to the dump).

If we manage to close current daily in red with big body, we should see that touch to support zone happen this week!

4. Bullish divergence on the RSI is another confirmation.
___
$2,500 Zone has supported  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  many times.

This $2.5K zone is a saviour from Ethereum's fall. If this zone breaks, this baby may rally further south.

For now, we are likely to see positive move before breaking the current support zone.

Can the bull even ride it to $2400?
___
Ethereum bounced off the upper boundary of descending channel. Asset bounced off the resistance level. Bearish movement to support level 2405 is expected to happen.
___
The two roads diverged in a yellow wood :)

Critical area for ETH at the moment around the $2,500 round number.

Break above $2,600 for a bullish reversal towards $2,900.

Break below $2,400 for a bearish continuation towards the $2,000.

Which scenario do you think is more likely to happen first and why?

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

On a daily timeframe, we are looking for that support zone where we had our last liquidity grab. 

This zone will decide the next major zone where breaking it would mean a nice Dowwnard movement breaking all lows here but seeing the price securing this zone we will see a bounce towards the 200EMA zone!

Swallow Team

The Mallicast team has conducted a recent analysis of Ethereum and concluded that, on short-term timeframes, an upward trend is expected for this cryptocurrency. Based on the analysis, Ethereum is projected to move towards a price of $2806.40, indicating a potential for significant price increase in this period.

This bullish trend suggests strong demand and possibly continued growth in the price within this timeframe. Investors and traders should closely monitor the market trends and make decisions accordingly. Additionally, it is advisable to employ appropriate risk management strategies to effectively capitalize on market fluctuations
___
Hi guys

We are at the bottom of the upward channel. On the other hand, the amount of Ethereum in the centralized exchange has reached the lowest historical level. It seems that investors are not sellers at these rates.

In the four-hour time frame, it seems that with the consumption of the $2408.3 support area, we can expect a downward trend similar to the scenario from the specified resistance range.

On the daily time frame, according to maintaining the support area and ascending channel, provided that the ascending trend line is maintained, the price area of ‚Äã‚Äã$2250 can be attractive for buying.

what do you think?
___
At 4h: we observe trading under the lower boundary of accumulation and formation of seller and liquidity imbalance zones from above behind the highs and the upper boundary of accumulation.

At 1h: here I expect either a liquidity re-sweep from the low or an inversion and a move to liquidity at the local high.

  

Stick to your risk managment!
___
Ethereum is looking interesting where we noticed a good bullish trend here where we have been bunching from one side to another side. 

What makes it interesting this time is that near the supportive line we also have a 200EMA sitting at, which is giving additional support to the zone. 

We are looking for this zone to be tested and a possible upward movement from there to happen.

Hey everyone!

Appreciate a like and follow if this analysis helps!

ETH is currently trading around $2400 level. It forms a symmetrical channel in the daily time frame and approaches towards the channel's lower trendline. 

As you see in the chart, it has a strong support of around $2100-$2300 level (Green Box). After we test this support, expecting a good bounce in quarter four of this year. 

All we need to survive the next 20-25 days patiently. After that, we will see a huge upside in the crypto market.

What are your thoughts on Ethereum's current price action? Share your analysis in the comments!
___
ETH/USDT is currently trading at $2,448, down by 0.07%. On the 4-hour chart, ETH shows signs of weakness after breaking down from a rising wedge pattern, a bearish signal suggesting a potential downside. Immediate support is around $2,395, with a more significant support level near $2,165, where a long-term trendline may provide a strong base. Resistance is seen at $2,580, and a break above this could shift the trend back to bullish. However, failure to hold above support levels might push ETH towards lower zones, potentially targeting the $2,100 area. Watch for volume confirmation on any breakout attempts.

I just made a bitcoin short idea and honestly after seeing Eth I have to make one for it as well. I am mixed between the 2. Eth looks cleaner for me and at a safer level compared to bitcoin right now. 

Bitcoin is still correcting its showing signs that it can give way any moment though

Am not gonna fomo though and get in too early. I would like my entry be a confident one at the end of this hour or a bit later.

When its ready and I enter I expect it to start melting right away with little to no draw down. There's no eth volume to support price right now on the weekend and it has lost major support levels.

Where I marked off on the chart for tp is where I anticipate that price could probably find some support.


Final verdict. I asked my younger which he like better eth or bitcoin and he says eth. And I agree. The RR will probable be bigger if bitcoin was to fall to $56000 or lower

at current price eth is roughly 8RR to $2250 and 16 RR to $2000

Time to lock. I'll post when I enter

Waiting for level confirmation Followed by correction 
At the moment, the ETH/USD trading situation is characterized by volatility, which is often seen in the cryptocurrency market. Ether (ETH) is at levels that can be both support and resistance, depending on current news and analytics. Investors are keeping a close eye on regulatory changes as well as the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, which could influence demand for Ether. Technical analysis shows some support and resistance levels where consolidation may occur. Market sentiment varies and traders are likely to continue to look for short and long term profit opportunities. It is important to keep in mind that changes in the global economy may also have an impact on the cryptocurrency market.

You need to understand that most of the beautiful posts about the amazing life of a traders, airdrop hunters are complete nonsense and "fake it till you make it" life! Most people lose money in trading, and this applies not only to the crypto market! Therefore, on the channel we do not talk about stupid things like tothemoon, uponly, super-profitable meme tokens and other nonsense! Ask yourself the question, are you ready to quit your job and go into full-time trading or full-time work with cryptocurrency! These can be nodes, an accounts farm for airdrops, content creation, work in a crypto project, be the meme token degen, trading. 

A few key questions that you need to honestly ask yourself
1. Do you have a extra cash for several months, if, for example, the first six months, you will not be able to make a profit from cryptocurrency?
2. How old are you and what are your expenses? After all, the responsibility for income when you have a family and children is much bigger than when you are 20 years old and you can live peacefully with responsibility only for yourself!
3. Do you have enough experience for regular trading, do you have an understanding of the market, if, for example, we will trade in a downward trend for 2-3 years and investments will not be able to generate income, but only trading! Do you have a deposit to work with!? Lets be real! Start with 100$ and trade every day with x50 lev its not a good idea and plan! One day all this succesefull signal channels and traders just drawdown their accounts, but they got a lot of money from Discords, memecoins alllocations! So be real with initial deposit! 
4. How are things going with storing funds, diversification, risk management and money management! Do you have a strategy and a plan for what exactly you will do every day?
5. Do you have skills outside the market, what will you do if your plan does not work? Will you be able to quickly find a job to restore the deposit and try again
6. Are you mentally ready to work every day in this area now? After all, now you will have a lot of time, without a boss and a stable fixed payment at the end of the month! Do you know how to plan your day and work! Are you a disciplined and balanced person, because emotional decisions and trading on fear or greed can ruin your entire deposit!
7. Do you have a plan in case of a black swan in the world, a new pandemic, a financial collapse or abrupt regulation of cryptocurrency in your region!

Fundamental analysis in the traditional financial markets involves evaluating a company's intrinsic value through a variety of metrics, such as earnings, revenue, and growth prospects. However, applying this same approach to cryptocurrency networks presents unique challenges. Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, and their value often stems from factors that don't align with conventional financial metrics.

Key Challenges:

Traditional Metrics Fall Short:

Cryptocurrency networks are not companies with revenues, profits, or physical assets. Therefore, traditional metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios or revenue growth don‚Äôt apply.

Misleading Social Media Data:

Social media presence and subscriber count might seem like indicators of a project‚Äôs popularity or potential, but these figures are easily manipulated. Fake followers, bots, and exaggerated engagement can create a false impression of legitimacy and success.

Isolated On-Chain Metrics:

While on-chain metrics provide valuable insights, they can be misleading if analyzed in isolation. For instance, a high number of active addresses might suggest widespread usage, but without context, it doesn't reveal whether these addresses represent genuine users or automated bots.

Relevant On-Chain Metrics:

Number of Transactions: Indicates the level of network activity, but doesn‚Äôt differentiate between meaningful transactions and spam.

Transaction Cost: Reflects the cost of using the network, which can indicate demand, but also congestion or inefficiency.

Active Addresses: Shows how many unique addresses are participating, but could be skewed by the creation of multiple addresses by a single entity.

Commissions (Fees): High fees might indicate network demand, but can also point to issues like scalability problems.

Hashrate or Coins in Staking: High hashrate or staking levels suggest network security and confidence, but can also centralize control if dominated by a few large players.

Design Indicators:

Whitepaper: This document outlines the project's goals, technology, and roadmap, but its value depends on the technical understanding of the reader and the honesty of the team.

Project Team: The experience and reputation of the team are crucial, but the anonymous or pseudonymous nature of many crypto projects complicates assessment.

Competitors: Understanding a project's competitors helps gauge its potential, but the fast-paced nature of the crypto space means that new competitors can emerge quickly.

Tokenomics: The economic model of the token, including supply, distribution, and incentives, is vital, but poorly designed tokenomics can lead to inflation or lack of demand.

Financial Indicators:

Capitalization: Market cap is often used as a quick measure of a project‚Äôs size and importance, but can be misleading in low-liquidity markets.

Liquidity: High liquidity indicates that an asset can be traded quickly without affecting its price, but low liquidity can lead to price manipulation.

Emission Method: The way tokens are issued (e.g., through mining, staking, or ICOs) affects supply dynamics, which can influence price stability and long-term viability.

In summary, while fundamental analysis in the crypto market is challenging, a multi-faceted approach combining on-chain metrics, design indicators, and financial indicators can offer valuable insights. However, these should always be interpreted with caution and in context, given the unique dynamics and rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape.

hello guys.

 Resistance Zone:
 Price action has recently tested the resistance zone around $2,668-$2,715 (yellow shaded area), which aligns with a Fibonacci retracement level of 0.618. The price was unable to break above this resistance and has started to move downward.

 Bearish Trend Formation:
 A clear downtrend is forming as the price has failed to make a higher high and is now making lower lows. The downtrend is confirmed by the rejection from the resistance zone.

 Fibonacci Retracement Levels:
 The chart uses Fibonacci levels to highlight potential support and resistance areas. Key levels to watch:
0.382 retracement at around $2,455.94
0.618 retracement at around $2,395.78 (next target zone)

 Key Support Levels:
 The next significant support level is around $2,366 (highlighted by the yellow zone at the bottom). If the price continues its downward movement, this area may serve as a potential buying opportunity or a target for short positions.

 Potential Trading Strategy:
 The bearish momentum suggests considering a short position with a target near the $2,366 support zone. A stop-loss could be placed above the recent high at $2,668 to manage risk.

 Market Outlook:
 Bearish in the short term as the price is likely to continue declining towards the next key support level.

 Overall, the chart suggests a bearish trend with a potential downside target around $2,366 if the current support level fails to hold.

üìä#ETH Ascending Triangleüìà

üò±When you wake up, the price is still the same, but your position is gone. If you look closely, you will see that it has been liquidated. So we must realize the importance of risk management. Unfortunately, yesterday‚Äôs short order was not triggered because the difference was 14 pointsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

üß†The current market is still in a shock stage, moving back and forth between the resistance zone and the buying zone. We are now in the red selling zone and relatively close to the resistance zone above, so chasing the rise is unreasonable. From a pattern perspective, we have the opportunity to form an ascending triangle here, and if we continue to break upward, we can try to place some short orders after reaching the resistance zone.

üîç ETH/USDT Analysis: 1-Hour Timeframe üìâ
 
The ETH/USDT chart on a 1-hour timeframe highlights significant upcoming dates where price movements may present trading opportunities. As always, it is crucial to analyze these signals in conjunction with higher timeframes for a more comprehensive understanding of the market.

	‚Ä¢	 August 24, 2024, 21:00, August 25, 2024, 21:00, August 28, 2024, 12:00 - Red Lines:  These times mark potential local peaks. Traders might consider these as moments to take profits or reduce exposure, as the price could encounter resistance or a downturn.
	‚Ä¢	 August 22, 2024, 21:00, August 25, 2024, 05:00, August 26, 2024, 15:00, August 29, 2024, 15:00 - Green Lines:  These times indicate potential local lows, providing favorable conditions for accumulating ETH or entering long positions.

When working with this 1-hour timeframe, keep in mind that these movements should be evaluated with a global perspective, considering higher timeframes to better grasp the overall market trend.

 For short-term, intraday, or scalp trades, consider analyzing lower timeframes. 

Note: The exact timing of these phases can vary by +/- a few hours. All times are based on UTC-7 (Los Angeles).

ETH has been trading inside this channel for over two years now. After the recent touch of the support, the support has solidified itself even further. Note that the support is a more clear-cut line, while the resistance is more an area.

Another touch of the bottom support would potentially be great news for the bulls, hence the signal on the chart. Seeing that we already touched it recently, we can use the wick as a clear stop level. Target placed at the top of the channel, $5000. This will create a great trade with a RR of 8.5.

Keep in mind that the support could potentially also break down. This would indicate a long-term bearish shift in trend.

üß† From a structural perspective, the goals of the double bottom long structure have been fully achieved, so there is an expectation of a callback. As the upward trend support line is broken, it means that the previous period of rise is over, so we need to be alert to the risk of further decline. üìâ

‚û°Ô∏èThe long order we got on the 28th was also hit and closed after the stop loss was moved up. However, we have already reduced our holdings twice, and the overall profit is still very generous. Congratulations to all the friends who followed Wolf King to print money. üí∞üçª

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  is clearly in the accumulation phase, sitting just below the psychological level of 3000. Recently, the price hit a support level that was also tested back in February and subsequently bounced off it. Over the past three weeks, we've observed mostly sideways movement. When examining the weekly timeframe, it's evident that the market formed a long-tailed bar, indicating a liquidity grab below the February low. This suggests that there was strong buying interest after the dip. Given that the market has retested the recent low area and rebounded, I believe we can expect a gradual upward movement from here. My target is resistance zone around 2950.

~ Futures trade setups.
~ Daily updates on Bitcoin and Ethereum.
~ High time frame (HTF) market bottom and top calls.
~ Short-term market movements.
~ Charts supported by critical fundamentals.

Now, let‚Äôs dive into this chart analysis:

ETH is holding decent support within the $2,184-$2,348 range. A few weeks ago, when the market experienced a major correction, ETH dropped to this same support range and bounced back.

With the price currently at $2,520, ETH is likely to test the 35 EMA resistance. If it closes above the 35 EMA, a rally toward the upper resistance at $3,750 is possible.

The RSI has rebounded from the oversold zone, and bullish momentum is building.

Key levels:

- Support Range: $2,184-$2,348.
- Primary Resistance: $2,930.
- Higher Target: $3,750.

Trade setup : Price broke below its 200-day moving average, which signaled downtrend. It bounced off $2,100 support and reached $2,800 resistance where it got rejected. Momentum is fading (MACD Histogram declining ). We would be buyers if price dips to $2,100 support again. The recent launch of nine ETH Spot ETFs could also boost demand for ETH. Learn to trade chart patterns in Lesson 8 and set Stop Loss levels in Lesson 9.

 Pattern : Price is Approaching Support, which is a level where it could pause or reverse its recent decline, at least temporarily. Support is often a level where price has bounced up in the past, or potentially prior Resistance level that was broken. (concept known as polarity). Once price breaks below support, it can move lower to the next support level. Learn to trade key levels in Lesson 7.

 Trend : Short-term trend is Strong Down, Medium-term trend is Strong Down and Long-term trend is Strong Down.

 Momentum  is Bullish but inflecting. MACD Line is still above MACD Signal Line but momentum may have peaked since MACD Histogram bars are declining, which suggests that momentum could be nearing a downswing. Price is neither overbought nor oversold currently, based on RSI-14 levels (RSI > 30 and RSI < 70).

 Support and Resistance : Nearest Support Zone is $2,400.00, then $2,100.00. Nearest Resistance Zone is $2,620.00, then $2,850.00.
___
The price of Ethereum broke below the support at $2500, which revived the possibility of a restest of the next support at $2200. Therefore, a structural higher low is going to form in a deep value zone following a breakdown from the rising wedge. The bulls have halted the bearish trend with a reversal above $2500 while the next price action remains uncertain. If the bulls maintain a healthy upswing, a rise above $2700 may elevate the levels to $3000. As the crypto winters are about to begin, the bullish probability remains within a limited range. 

Therefore, if the price loses the current support zone between $2350 and $2416, then a drop close to $2000 could be imminent. This move may attract the required liquidity, which may revive a strong ascending trend. 

The ETH price is still trading above the EMA 50 support level in the longer time frame and hence there could be a possibility of a price capitulation. Therefore, the sluggish phase is expected to go on where the price may continue its trade within a narrow range. Hence, the Ethereum (ETH) price is believed to maintain a range-bound trade for a few more weeks, which may result in a bullish breakout beyond $3000.

The Spot ETFs is always a bullish development. Crypto is growing, the market is expanding and is being accepted all across the world. This is good and we love it.

The effect these "financial vehicles" have on the market is a completely different monster.

The effect is surely bullish, long-term, but on the short-term things can be different.

You know, this is a business. In business, when you buy large quantities of anything, usually you tend to get a big discount.

The institutions want crypto, the giants want Ether and they want billions of it. There is a catch though, they are willing to pay only around $1,000 to $1,200 for each ETH and this they say is still a big price.

Long story short, these giant institutions bought billions of dollars worth of Ether and this will soon reflect on the price.

The chart says a support range of $1500 - $1750 as the next support, but, knowing that they paid around $1,100 per ETH God only knows how far down the price will actually go.

Namaste.
___
BINANCE:ETHUSD  ETH is consolidating in front of strong resistance. Bulls do not let the price down beyond 0.5 fibo. amid Friday's news, the cryptocurrency market is reviving and ETH has high chances to pass through 2800. 

  

A false breakout of the resistance of the range is formed, but instead of falling, the coin is consolidating, which is generally one of the pre-breakout nuances. Technically, it would be an ideal condition for me to wait for a prolonged consolidation near 2780-2800 followed by a price advance towards the zone with a breakout target. The liquidation that took place earlier rid the market of an unnecessary part of speculators, after which the whales went into an active accumulation phase, now ETH shows positive preconditions of readiness to go to the intermediate high and resistance of the global range. 

 Support levels: 2717, 0.5 fibo
Resistance levels: 2780, 2817 

The market is bullish, as evidenced by some indicators, technical indicators on the chart, as well as the fundamental background. Accordingly, in the mid-term I expect the price to come out of the consolidation 2780 - 2550 and most likely this exit will be accompanied by a breakout of resistance and growth to 3300.

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:ETHUSD   ;) 


Regards R. Linda!

Ethereum corrected itself after nearing 4000. 2000 is the newly created base support . If the current bull run continues it will most likely reach 5000 in the long run. It might take quite some time but entering near 2000 area and having stop below 2000 would be the safe bet. The monthly wave indicator is still in the bull run zone and it has not confirmed the bull run is over .

Ethereum has broken a flip range to the bottom and is now pulling back towards this area.

Also, Ethereum's structure is bearish in large timeframes.

We are looking for sell/short positions in the POI range.

The targets are marked on the chart.

Closing a daily candle above the invalidation level will violate the analysis.

For risk management, please don't forget stop loss and capital management
When we reach the first target, save some profit and then change the stop to entry

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

 üìàETH has been overall bullish,  trading inside the flat rising channel in orange.

Moreover, ETH is approaching a massive round number $2500.

üèπ The highlighted blue circle is a strong area to look for buy setups as it is the intersection of the $2500 and lower orange trendline acting as a non-horizontal support.

 üìö As per my trading style: 
As #ETH approaches the blue circle zone, I will be looking for bullish reversal setups (like a double bottom pattern, trendline break , and so on...)

 üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

Etherium long position from 2590$.
There is a nice retest of a broken trendline.
Waiting for the retest and then things will look better.
___
It looks like ETH is making an attempt to push towards ~3k coming days/next week. Alts are performing pretty decent as well, which is what you want to see for bullish continuation - An overall strong market, not just BTC, so I'm giving this a high chance.

As I said in my BTC analyis, 61k is the level to hold for BTC for the next 2-3 days, for ETH this level would be ~2.7k.

Key level for ETH is around 3.2k (monthy open), if we see this month close above this level, it's a matter of time until we see ETH picking up momentum again heading into september. 

3.6k should be a tough nut to break and we could see a higher low around ~3k before going up much higher. So ideally you want to see ETH forming higher lows from now on but once it gets back above 2.8k this would aready be my invalidation level (on a daily close that is). 

Still believe ETH is primed for 5-6k+ this year but it will likely be the last leg of this bull market. Don't dare to predict when it's going to happen, but it will surely take another 2-3 months. 

So as a trader you basically just let your positions ride at this point. Any entry below 2.8k is quite decent, so don't worry if you didn't catch the bottom of the flush we saw few weeks ago. 

Stay safe!

ETHUSDT.P daily timeframe prediction + description


1. **Elliott Wave Structure**:
   - The chart illustrates a **5-wave impulse pattern** (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) marked with green lines. This pattern typically represents a strong directional move in the market, either up or down.
   - Following the 5-wave impulse, there is a **3-wave corrective pattern** (labeled A, B, C) marked with red lines. This corrective pattern is a common structure where the market retraces a portion of the previous impulse move.

2. **Fibonacci Extension Levels**:
   - The chart has two key Fibonacci levels highlighted: **0.618** and **0.5**.
   - The **0.618 to 0.5 Fibonacci extension level** is located from around 2560 to around 2458.

3. **Equilibrium and Take Profit (TP)**:
   - An "Equilibrium" level is marked on the chart, representing a significant horizontal price level where the market might find balance.
   - A "75% TP" level is indicated at 2819.17, which is a suggested price target where a trader might take profit on their position.

4. **Price Action**:
   - The current market price is shown between the labeled points A, B, and C, with the red lines connecting these points indicating the ongoing ABC corrective wave.

### Prediction (ABC Correction):
The Idea is predicting that the market is currently in an **ABC corrective phase** following a significant 5-wave impulse move downwards. Here‚Äôs the detailed description:

1. **Wave A** represents the first corrective move upward after the 5-wave downward impulse.
2. **Wave B** is the subsequent move downward, representing a partial retracement of Wave A.
3. **Wave C** is the final move in the correction, expected to move upward again and typically reaching or slightly exceeding the end of Wave A.

### Specific Prediction Based on the Chart:
- The prediction indicates that the price will likely continue upward from the current level, aiming to complete the **C wave** of the ABC correction.
- **Wave C** is expected to reach around the **0.618 Fibonacci extension level**, which is marked as a significant resistance point.
- Once Wave C is completed, this could signify the end of the correction phase and potentially the resumption of the previous trend (either continuing downwards or reversing to the upside, depending on broader market conditions).

This type of analysis is used by traders to anticipate market movements and make informed decisions on entering or exiting positions based on the likelihood of these patterns playing out as predicted.

the last TP: 3011
entry: 2550
SL: 2367

A slight pullback might be expected before wave C and notice that this might not be in the next few days or weeks, the date is not fixed.

After seeing the reaction of Asia making a new low and seeing that London has just made a new low I had marked a buy order in the middle of the 4H FVG as if it was respected it would be a great opportunity to continue rising until the next bullish 4H FVG.  BINANCE:ETHUSDT
___
Although Ethereum showed some strength during the latest market pump, the token didn't clear essential levels.

On the contrary, ETH was rejected at the significant 2.8k resistance and the 4H EMA200.

Currently, ETH is struggling to stay above its sideways channel trendline. A close below this trendline on the daily chart would put us back where we came from. 

Moreover, the 2.5k level would return to the play in this case.

Volume continues to be relatively low ‚Äî especially in the context of a significant breakout.

Therefore, the story remains the same: As long as ETH trades below 2.8k, long trade entries don't make sense.

Hi everyone, in my analysis ETH will break through resistance this week and rise to 3,000 ++

Don't forget to put STOP LOSS for your position, remember STOP LOSS is the key of consistency trading for long term.

üìä#ETH Bearish Head and Shoulders Structure‚ùì

üò±When I woke up, I found that my position had decreased. It turned out that the profit was automatically stopped after reaching the target  ü•≥

üß†From a structural perspective, we have a bearish head and shoulders structure built near the resistance zone, but I am not prepared to participate in this short opportunity just yet because there is a larger level bull structure present. Moreover, it is very close to the 2694 support area, the inflection point below, so short selling is not cost-effective.

(ETHUSDT 1D chart)

The key is whether the price can rise above 2851.75 to break out of the short-term downtrend channel.

-
Currently, it has risen above the M-Signal indicator on the 1M chart.

Therefore, from a long-term perspective, it is possible that the uptrend will continue.

However, in order for a full-scale uptrend to begin, the M-Signal on the 1D chart > M-Signal on the 1W chart > M-Signal on the 1M chart must be in that state.

Therefore, we need to see if it can maintain the price by rising above the M-Signal indicator on the 1W chart after the volatility period around September 8th.

-
Since the StochRSI indicator is currently in the overbought zone, it is important at what point it finds support when the StochRSI indicator falls from the overbought zone and becomes StochRSI < StochRSI EMA.

Therefore, if it fails to rise above 2851.75 and falls, it is important to see if it can find support around 2621.99-2700.43.

If it finds support around 2621.99-2700.43 and switches to the state of StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, it is expected to lead to an attempt to rise above 2851.75.

-
If the M-Signal indicator of the 1W chart rises above, the HA-High indicator (3265.00) of the 1W chart and the HA-High indicator (3321.30) of the 1M chart are likely to be the first resistance zones.

-
The volatility period on the BTCUSDT chart is around September 13.

However, the volatility period on the ETHUSDT chart is expected to start around September 8.

Therefore, the key is whether it can escape the short-term downtrend channel after September 8.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin after rising above 29K.

The area expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23

4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

üß†From a structural perspective, the bullish cup-and-handle structure within the 4-hour level is still intact, so there are still bullish expectations.

‚û°Ô∏èWe started to fall back after being blocked by the resistance area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe two necklines (2805-2813) again. This is very reasonable. The support area that can be seen currently is around 2700-2730.

üìä#ETH Bullish Cup and Handle Structureüìà

üß†We placed some long orders after breaking the key watershed downtrend line and saw a nice move up. From a structural perspective, a bullish cup-and-handle structure has been established, and there is still room for continued gains in the future.

‚û°Ô∏èHowever, after we broke through the previous high, we encountered the resistance of two necklines (2805-2813), so we need to be wary of the risk of a correction. Even if we want to participate in new long transactions, we should wait patiently for a period of correction before considering it.

‚û°Ô∏èUnfortunately, there was only a US$1 difference from our TP2 and the automatic reduction was not triggered, so we manually reduced our position by 30% and only retained 20% of our position. We are patiently looking forward to more.

The price is in consolidation, with Unemployment Claims and Powell's statements ahead for the week; therefore, the setup is defensive.
___
Current Situation:
Ethereum's daily chart remains unchanged as the price consolidates within its current range. The longer this consolidation continues, the larger the anticipated breakout could be.

Trade Position:
Currently positioned long on ETH, but traders should be cautious of a potential stop-hunt that might trigger a flush to the downside before the significant move occurs.

Key Level to Watch:

Support Level: $2,350 ‚Äì This is the critical area to monitor if a downside flush happens.
Stay vigilant and prepared for potential volatility as the consolidation phase unfolds.

Market activity for Ethereum (ETH) has been subdued, showing only a slight increase of 2.45% in price, now trading around the $2,600 level.

This kind of price behavior is typical when an asset is trading within a symmetrical triangle‚Äîa pattern characterized by converging diagonal upper and lower lines.

Previous instances of such trading patterns have often led to significant price movements, either upwards or downwards.

Momentum among Ethereum traders is increasing, as indicated by the Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD). 

This tool tracks the relationship between two moving averages of ETH‚Äôs price, helping to spot changes in momentum and direction. 

Recently, the MACD signaled a bullish crossover, suggesting that buyers are actively entering the market and may continue to push the price upward.

Additionally, Ethereum‚Äôs momentum has been on the rise, with the MACD trending toward positive territory. This suggests a strong likelihood of continued price increases.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also supports this bullish outlook. It has been rising since the 18th of August, indicating that buying pressure was mounting. 

If this trend persists, it could further propel ETH‚Äôs price higher to the $2,800 target.

üìä#ETH is blocked by the downward trendline‚ùå

üß†Recently, ETH has been consolidating sideways since it reached the resistance zone. The differences are relatively large, the trend is not good-looking, and it is not standard, so I rarely pay attention to it. Only when we get out of this divergence area will trading become easier.

‚û°Ô∏èThe key watershed that can be seen at present is the downward trend line. Today is the third test. If it cannot successfully break through, then I hope to see the price move back to the buying zone below.

The 4-hour chart for ETH/USDT shows a promising setup as Ethereum hovers around the $2,600 mark, forming a potential reversal pattern. The price recently tested the $2,536 support level and has since shown signs of a recovery.

The key resistance to watch is at $2,725. A successful break above this level could confirm a bullish continuation, potentially driving Ethereum towards the $2,800 mark. However, if the price fails to maintain momentum above $2,600, a retest of the $2,536 support level could be in play.

The shaded blue area on the chart represents a critical decision zone where bulls and bears will battle for control. A move above $2,725 could ignite further buying interest, while a failure could result in a pullback.

Traders should monitor this level closely, as it will determine the short-term direction for Ethereum.

There are many, many good altcoins right now, great buy opportunities and we should definitely focus on the positive side, but, we cannot ignore the Crypto-giants for too long.

üëâ Money flowing out of Ethereum will flow to the smaller altcoins.

The situation with Ethereum is critical. While it dropped already almost 50% from its March 2024 high, there is still another ~40% drop, incoming, from current price.

Again, this is a positive development for the cryptocurrency market.

‚û¢ Ethereum reaching lower prices will allow for many new participants to enter the space, and this is good.

‚û¢ Ethereum moving lower will make it more affordable for developers to develop new projects; thousands and thousands of projects are being developed on the Ethereum network.

‚û¢ Once the bottom is hit, a very strong LONG/bullish opportunity will develop, and this is all very good.

Ethereum's situation is critical according to this chart. It will be a flash crash and is likely to start this very same month.

Bitcoin sideways is needed for the altcoins to grow.
Ethereum is not Bitcoin, so it can go down and the market won't even know.

üëâ Focus on the mid- to small cap. altcoins.

Look for the ones trading near support or at all-time lows; with these, you can't go wrong.

Those trading high up, as this pair is, ETHUSDT, stay away.
Only after the correction is over you can consider buying again.

This is just a friendly reminder.
This thing is going to crash.
Stay safe!

Namaste.

Will this be a C wave going down and make 1:1 with the A. or we are done correcting and going to start the next impulse?  

We are about to enter support zone, if we break it, I think we will head to  0.9 fib to 1.0fib
(2460.19 - 2434.15)

Since this is possibly the last corrective wave down, I am thinking, this can be either a 

Wave C within the ABC of Wave 2

Or we are in sub wave 5th within Wave C, if we zoom out to let say 12hr chart.  

Conclusion:
breaking below 2513 is my bear case (4 HR chart)

1st Bull case would be break 2698 and 100 SMA

2nd Bull case for a decent bull run would be break 2786 with potential rejection at 200 SMA (4HR Chart).

Analyzing the ETH/USDT chart on a daily timeframe, we see a volatile and somewhat bearish trend emerging over the past few months. Here's a detailed breakdown of the chart, highlighting key resistance and support levels, along with insights from the MACD and RSI indicators.

Key Observations:

Trend Analysis: Ethereum has displayed a series of lower highs and lower lows since peaking, indicating a bearish trend. The trendline (R1) has consistently acted as a resistance, and the price is currently testing this line, suggesting a critical juncture.

Support and Resistance Levels:

Resistance Levels (R2 and R3): R2 at $3,043 and R3 at $4,105.80. These levels represent potential upside barriers in the event of a price reversal.
Support Level (S1): The significant support level is at $2,126.90. This level has historical relevance as a pivot point for price actions.
MACD Indicator: The MACD line is currently below the signal line and both are trending downward below the zero line, which traditionally indicates bearish momentum. However, the histogram suggests that the negative momentum is slowing, possibly pointing to an impending stabilization or reversal.

RSI Indicator: The RSI is around 36, which is nearing the oversold territory. This could indicate that the selling pressure might soon exhaust, offering potential for a bullish reversal if other factors align.

Technical Analysis and Conclusion:
The Ethereum market appears to be at a critical stage. The proximity to the major support at S1 and the nearing oversold conditions suggest that we could see a short-term reversal if the support holds. Investors and traders should watch for any bullish reversal patterns or a break above the trendline R1 as potential signs of a change in momentum.

However, a break below the support at $2,126.90 could lead to further declines, with the potential to test much lower levels, given the absence of immediate visible support below S1 on the chart.

Trading Strategy:

For Bullish Traders: Look for confirmation of a support hold at S1 and a potential bullish reversal pattern or a break above R1. If entering a long position, consider setting stop-loss orders below S1 to manage risks.
For Bearish Traders: Monitor for a sustained break below S1. If this occurs, consider entering short positions with a view to capitalize on further declines. Place stop-loss orders just above the most recent highs to limit potential losses.
As always, it's crucial to consider external factors such as market news, overall crypto market trends, and economic indicators that could influence Ethereum's price movements. Stay updated and adjust strategies accordingly.
___
BINANCE:ETHUSDT  

ETH is definitely the weakest of the 3 majors (BTC, ETH, SOL)

However, I am seeing way too much bearishness on ETH, which is warranted due to its piss poor price action, but that does not mean it is going to teleport down to sub 2k. 


Signs of over bearishness: 

- OI divergence and finding support at previous areas (price is lower but OI is the same as it was back in April and May 2024) 

- Funding rates in the negatives or near zero (more shorts than longs) 


I do not believe ETH will moon or out pace BTC or SOL. But I do think this increased bearishness has swung too far in one direction and when that happens it typically swings back hard in the other direction. 

ETH definitely needs more time to stomach this recent sell off but even if it retests 2200 again I think a bottom is close or in. There is more liquidity sitting at prices higher above. 

I expect ETH to eventually take out 2900 and then come back to 3300 and 3500 by at least EOY. 

Let's see what happens. Good luck to the shorts heading into election season.
___
Ethereum is currently within the $2600 to $2700 resistance range. This range is recognized as a significant resistance that might halt the current upward trend and initiate a downward movement.

 Potential Scenarios: 

 Price Correction from the Resistance Zone: 
If Ethereum fails to break through the $2600 to $2700 resistance range, a price correction towards the $2500 and $2400 support levels is likely. These levels could act as key points for a potential price reversal and continuation of the downward trend.
 Breaking Resistance and Continuing the Uptrend: 
If Ethereum can break through the $2700 resistance and stabilize above it, this move could indicate the continuation of the uptrend, with the price moving towards higher levels.
___
Ethereum may also experience a bearish trend this week, with the price potentially dropping to the 2307.14 range. However, this trend could be followed by a correction, leading to a potential rise up to 2872.41.

Here is a global wave analysis of the  OKX:ETHUSDT  price
After the launch of #ETHETF, the price correction of  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  has started
After launch, #BTCETF was similar to the  CRYPTOCAP:BTC  price. Well, this is logical, because large funds need a trading volume to purchase a large position and preferably as cheaply as possible.
The probable correction wave (4) was 0.5 of the previous wave (3)

Now the main task is to keep the  OKX:ETHUSDT  price in the range of $2250-2550
Well, and from this zone can start the growth wave (5) with the goal of at least $5950-6000 per  CRYPTOCAP:ETH

For the past 12 days, Ethereum (ETH) has been stuck in a $200 range.
* Support:¬†$2,550
* Resistance:¬†$2,750

In fact, if you look at the price from 12 days ago, it‚Äôs almost identical to what it is now. Simply put, the last 12 days have been boring and, some might say, pointless.

But before we get too frustrated, let‚Äôs remember: this kind of price action is pretty normal. In the crypto world, markets range sideways 70-80% of the time.

So, what‚Äôs causing this?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Market Consolidation:
After a big move‚Äîlike the sharp drop Ethereum experienced at the beginning of August‚Äîthe market often takes time to consolidate. During this period, prices move sideways as traders and investors reassess their positions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Volatility and Liquidity:
Even though ETH and other cryptos are known for their volatility, that volatility often comes in short, intense bursts. The rest of the time, prices stabilize within a range.

However, trader impatience is a hidden danger in this kind of prolonged consolidation.

When the market is stuck in a range for too long, traders can start to see opportunities where none exist. This often leads to entering risky trades, only to be stopped out when the real price action finally kicks in.

So, what should you do?

Watch and Prepare.
This is the time to strategize for the breakout. Be ready for movement in either direction. Select your most promising tokens, and nail down the key details‚Äîlike entry points, stop losses, and more.

ETH/USDT Analysis 

üí∞ Welcome to Your Channel!
Welcome to our channel where we delve into the intricacies of financial markets. Today, we focus on ETH/USDT, dissecting its current price action to uncover strategic trading opportunities. Join us as we analyze key levels and market dynamics, aiming to refine our trading strategies and maximize potential gains.

üí° Previous Analysis Review:
In the previous analysis, we anticipated a sweep of the Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL), but instead, the market created Equal Lows (EQL) near the SSL, forming a key liquidity level. This development alters the market's potential direction and opens up new scenarios.

üìçCurrent Market Overview:
‚Ä¢ Current Price: ETH/USDT is trading at 2,653.01, having recently swept the Previous Week High (PWH).
Key Levels:
‚Ä¢ EQL: Positioned near 2,560.00, forming a significant support and liquidity zone.
‚Ä¢ BSL (Buy-Side Liquidity): The recent sweep of the PWH suggests a potential revisit to this BSL zone.
‚Ä¢ 4H FVG: The Fair Value Gap above the current price acts as a resistance, capping further upside unless a significant breakout occurs.

üîç Identifying Key Levels
‚Ä¢ PMH (Previous Month High): 3,600.00
‚Ä¢ PWH (Previous Week High): 2,740.00
‚Ä¢ PML (Previous Month Low): 2,560.00
‚Ä¢ SSL (Sell-Side Liquidity): 2,310.00
‚Ä¢ BSL (Buy-Side Liquidity): 2,740.00
‚Ä¢ 4H FVG: Near the BSL zone, offering potential resistance.

üìä Key Considerations
‚Ä¢ Equal Lows (EQL): The creation of EQL near the SSL indicates strong sell-side liquidity. This could attract future bearish interest, making it a critical level to monitor.
‚Ä¢ Sweep of BSL: After sweeping the PWH, another sweep of the BSL is likely, leading to a potential expansion lower targeting sell-side levels.
‚Ä¢ Sell-Side Target: The key downside targets include the SSL levels below 2,560.00. If these are taken out, the bearish scenario could extend towards the SSL at 2,310.00 or lower.

üìà Bullish Scenario
For any bullish scenario to materialize:

‚Ä¢ Break Above BSL: A clear break and close above the BSL (near the 4H FVG) is required. This would invalidate the bearish outlook and suggest a continuation higher.
‚Ä¢ Sweep of Sell-Side Levels: The market must take out the EQL and SSL to remove the bearish pressure and open up higher targets.

üìâ Bearish Scenario
A bearish scenario is more likely if:

‚Ä¢ Rejection at BSL: After sweeping the PWH, a failure to break above the BSL (4H FVG) could lead to a significant move lower.
‚Ä¢ Expansion Lower: Following the BSL sweep, an expansion lower targeting the SSL and EQL is expected. This would align with the market's current bearish structure.

üìä Chart Analysis Summary
‚Ä¢ Bullish Expectation: Requires a clean break above the BSL, with the sell-side liquidity being taken out first.
‚Ä¢ Bearish Expectation: Anticipating an expansion lower after sweeping the BSL, targeting key sell-side levels.

üìù Conclusion:
The market's creation of EQL near the SSL has introduced a strong bearish outlook, particularly after the recent sweep of the PWH. A sweep of the BSL followed by a move lower is expected, but for any bullish scenario, the sell-side levels must first be taken out.

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Please also click "Boost".

Have a nice day today.

-------------------------------------

The key is whether the M-Signal indicator on the 1M chart can rise above and maintain the price.

To do so, we need to check whether it can rise along the rising trend line during the volatility period starting around the week of August 19.

If not, and it falls below 2531.05, there is a possibility that it will fall again to around 2159.0, so we need to think about a countermeasure for this.

-
Currently, the StochRSI indicator has entered the oversold zone and is maintaining the status of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA.

Therefore, it is important to see if it can be supported around the 2531.05 ~ 0.382 (2647.88) section.

Therefore, it is recommended to proceed with a purchase when the StochRSI indicator is out of the oversold section and StochRSI > StochRSI EMA.

However, since the current chart is a 1W chart, it is possible that it has shown a lot of increase when the above situation occurs.

Therefore, you should check whether there is support in the section (2531.05 ~ 0.382 (2647.88)) and see if you can proceed with a split purchase.

-
If you compare the current flow with the past flow, it seems to be showing a movement corresponding to around May 9, 2022.

However, the current situation is a bit different from that time.

When it was around May 9, 2022, there was a decline in USDT, but currently, USDT is showing an increase.

Therefore, I think it is showing a different flow than before in that it is time to find a time to buy even if it falls further than the current price, not a time to find a time to cut losses.

-
Have a good time.

Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will start when it rises above 29K.

The section expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41

4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

üî∏Following the market crash in August 3, ETH fell by 37% from $3,639 down to $2,150. The pair has since pulled back by 30% currently sitting at $2,613.

üîπWhile Bitcoin recently reached a new ATH, ETH on the other hand only reached $4,000, $800 lower than it's ATH. This makes this recent price fall a lucrative price to buy for long-term holders specially the current price at $2,610 and the $2,150.

üî∏There has been a significant increase in both staking and restaking of ETH, which supports Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. EigenLayer, a restaking platform on Ethereum, saw an 11% increase in its total value locked (TVL) in one week, signaling growth in the restaking market.

üîπPositive fundamentals followed by a overall market recovery would reignite the bullish movement and push the price up above the 0.61 ($2,903) from there the next significant price levels to watch out for would be the 200 MA (3,240), $3,600 and $4,100.

üî∏On the other hand, further bearish momentum in the crypto market in the short-term could send the price down to $2,150 which still wouldn't change the overall bullish trend However, if the price drops below this level, it could signal a potential shift in market trend, leading ETH into a prolonged downtrend or bear market.

Trade setup : Price broke below its 200-day moving average, which signaled downtrend. However, it got oversold (RSI < 30) near $2,400 support and bounced up. Also notice the unusually high volume, which also suggests that a lot of sellers have already exited. Momentum is inflecting bullish again (MACD Histogram rising) and price could reach $2,850 resistance. This is a riskier trade setup because it‚Äôs a trend reversal not a trend continuation setup. It‚Äôs against the overall downtrend. The recent launch of nine ETH Spot ETFs could also boost demand for ETH. Learn to trade chart patterns in Lesson 8 and set Stop Loss levels in Lesson 9.

 Pattern : Price is  Approaching Resistance , which is a level where it could pause or reverse its recent advance, at least temporarily. Resistance is often a level where price got rejected in the past, or potentially prior Support level that was broken. (concept known as polarity). Once price breaks above resistance, it can advance higher to the next resistance level. Learn to trade key levels in Lesson 7.

 Trend : Short-term trend is Strong Down, Medium-term trend is Strong Down and Long-term trend is Strong Down.

 Momentum : Price is neither overbought nor oversold currently, based on RSI-14 levels (RSI > 30 and RSI < 70).

 Support and Resistance : Nearest Support Zone is $2,400.00, then $2,100.00. Nearest Resistance Zone is $2,620.00, then $2,850.00.

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  

Eth Now have Two Mode I mentioned The red Box Pretty Interesting The First One is 2,780 
And The Second One IS 2,433 . Ethereum (ETH) is another prominent cryptocurrency that, like Bitcoin, experiences significant price fluctuations. Currently, Ethereum's price is observed with two key levels of interest: $2,780 and $2,433, which are highlighted as potential points of focus on its price chart.

The price level of $2,780 is often considered a resistance point. Resistance levels are prices at which selling pressure may increase, potentially causing the asset to struggle to move above this point. If Ethereum approaches this level, it might face challenges breaking through it, leading to potential price stabilization or even a reversal if the resistance holds.

Conversely, the $2,433 level is identified as a support point. Support levels are where buying interest may emerge, potentially preventing the price from falling further. If Ethereum‚Äôs price drops to this level, it could find buying strength, which might stabilize or even push the price upwards if the support holds firm.

Both of these levels are crucial for traders and investors to watch. If Ethereum moves towards $2,780, it could signal a test of resistance, while a dip towards $2,433 might indicate testing of support. Monitoring these levels helps in making informed trading and investment decisions based on potential price movements and market trends.

2nd Box in the Chart 

   First, when we look at the boxes on the chart, we can notice the horizontal accumulation zones that continue upwards sequentially. Now, let's look at the 2nd and 3rd boxes. In the 2nd box, we see a downtrend channel. After the price uses the bottom region of the box as support sufficiently with this downtrend channel, it gives the first upward breakout, and the uptrend process begins. 

 3rd Box 

Now, let's look at the 3rd box. The price reached the  EUROTLX:4K  region, and despite many news events like the ETF, that price region acted as resistance and went down. Meanwhile, a downtrend channel similar to the one in the 2nd box formed. If we look closely, we can see that the price has already started using this downtrend channel. I think this process will continue similarly to the 2nd box. In other words, I believe that the upward breakout process will begin when the price squeezes until the end of the convergence between the downtrend channel and the bottom support region of the box. This could likely take a few months because there is quite a bit of space between the downtrend channel and the lower support of the 3rd box, and the price hasn't started squeezing yet. 

 After Breaking Upwards 

After the price breaks upwards, I think it will move in a structure similar to the purple-colored movement, more or less. This is because the two uptrend lines below form an ascending wedge, and I believe the price will somehow catch up with this again.

The structure of the market for ethereum in the form of channels and Elliott waves in the long term shows that ethereum can record new ceilings in the coming year, I imagine the fractal movement according to the shape.

At the moment, ETH is lagging behind BTC. But the situation is fully formed and a sharp pump to the upper limit of the sidewall should be expected.
If you take a deeper look, then the level of 2500 was held, which means that there are few participants in the market to go lower and knock out their stop-losses
___
It's no secret, Ethereum has been struggling this Bullrun. 
Outperformed by Solana and other new emerging L1's, a permabearish ETH/BTC chart and losing market share in terms of volume on chain to its competitors. 

The daily chart is a difficult one to digest as a fan of ETH, despite the ETF approval and the institutional investment that has come with it, the trend is an obvious downtrend of late and shows no signs of changing anytime soon...

The ETH/BTC pair is a similar story only the downtrend has been the case for much longer, unable to keep up with bitcoins price gains. Bitcoin is currently -20% from its ATH set earlier this year, Ethereum is yet to break its previous ATH set in '21 of $4850, -47% at current price which is way off BTC. 

For me there are two possible entries:

- A mid range reclaim would then target a range high move going into the end of the year.

- A safer entry of filling the wick set in the beginning of august with a slow grind down, sweep liquidity, reclaim and pump from there.

Both situations would require BTC to behave as always.

Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, has made headlines once again, but this time it's not about politics‚Äîit's about cryptocurrency. Recent financial disclosures have revealed that Trump holds between $1 million and $5 million in Ethereum ( CRYPTOCAP:ETH ), placing him among the prominent figures in the digital asset space. This revelation comes at a time when the crypto market is facing significant volatility, particularly for Ethereum, which is experiencing heavy selloffs and ETF outflows.

Trump‚Äôs Deepening Involvement in Crypto
The disclosure of Trump‚Äôs Ethereum holdings marks a significant shift in his financial strategy, particularly given his past criticisms of cryptocurrencies. Once dismissive of Bitcoin and other digital assets, Trump now appears to be embracing the crypto world, not just as an investor but as an active participant in the burgeoning market. His Ethereum ( CRYPTOCAP:ETH ) holdings, valued at up to $5 million, suggest a calculated move to diversify his wealth and capitalize on the growing influence of digital currencies.

But Trump's involvement doesn't stop at Ethereum. He has also earned millions through NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), a digital asset class that has exploded in popularity over the past few years. According to the financial disclosure, Trump has raked in over $7 million from NFT licensing deals, making him a significant player in the NFT market as well. His NFT projects, including the controversial Trump Digital Trading Cards, have generated over 15,808 ETH in trading volume on OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces.

The Crypto Influence of the Trump Family
Trump's foray into the crypto world isn't an isolated endeavor. His family, particularly Donald Trump Jr., has also shown a keen interest in digital assets. Trump Jr. recently launched a Telegram channel dedicated to cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi), which has quickly amassed over 11,000 members. This initiative, dubbed "The Defiant Ones," signals the Trump family's growing influence in the crypto space and their intention to leverage this new frontier for political and financial gain.

The timing of these revelations is particularly noteworthy as they coincide with Trump's ongoing campaign for a return to the White House. His deepening involvement in cryptocurrency could be seen as a strategic move to align himself with the rapidly growing number of crypto enthusiasts and investors, a demographic that has become increasingly influential in American politics.

Ethereum‚Äôs Tumultuous Moment
Trump‚Äôs significant Ethereum ( CRYPTOCAP:ETH ) holdings come at a time when the cryptocurrency is under intense market pressure. On August 15, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net outflow of $39.21 million, reflecting waning investor confidence. This was further exacerbated by a major whale selloff, where 2,978 ETH were dumped, adding to the bearish sentiment surrounding the digital asset.

Crypto analysts have issued warnings of a potential correction in Ethereum's price, with some predicting a drop below the crucial $2,000 support level. The combination of ETF outflows, whale selloffs, and technical indicators like the TD Sequential flashing sell signals all point to a challenging period ahead for Ethereum.

Political Implications and Market Impact
Trump‚Äôs crypto investments, particularly his substantial Ethereum holdings, add a new layer of intrigue to his political persona. His entry into the crypto space could resonate with younger, tech-savvy voters who view digital assets as the future of finance. Moreover, it positions him as a forward-thinking leader who is willing to embrace new technologies, a narrative that could play well in his presidential campaign.

However, Trump's crypto dealings could also attract scrutiny, especially from regulators who are increasingly focused on the digital asset market. The fact that Trump has quietly amassed a fortune in Ethereum while the broader market faces regulatory challenges and volatility could raise questions about his motives and the potential impact of his financial decisions on the market. Donald Trump is making his mark in the crypto world, and the implications could be far-reaching.

In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Trump's actions may set a precedent for other political figures to follow, potentially intertwining the worlds of digital assets and political power in unprecedented ways.

Is ETHEREUM About to Crash?
 
 Technical Analysis: 

Ethereum (ETH) has formed a bearish wedge pattern, suggesting a potential downward move.
 A strong resistance zone near $2,780 has pushed the price back down. 

Consequently, ETH is likely to continue its decline in the coming days.

Key support levels to watch are $2,450 and $2,330, with the possibility of further drops to $2,200.

1d: got a reaction after liquidity withdrawal in the buyer's block order zone and came to the seller's imbalance.



Now rebalanced to the breaker imbalance zone and key level.

In this video, I dive into the current status of Ethereum and Bitcoin. I discuss why both tokens are approaching decisive levels. Moreover, I also highlight what might happen in case Ethereum and Bitcoin can't manage to stay above these level.

___
The price of Ethereum (ETH) has steadily rebounded from its low of $2666, demonstrating the market's continued confidence in cryptocurrencies. With an increase in trading volume and positive market sentiment, ETH is expected to break through the key resistance level of $2900. The support level and moving average indicators on the technical chart both indicate an increase in buying power, suggesting further upward potential for prices in the short term.
___
Hello everyone, I would like to invite you to a quick review of ETH/USDT, taking into account the 4-hour interval.  As you can see, the price, despite the nice rebound, still remains below the downward trend line.     

Moving on, we will move on to determining support and here the price is currently bouncing off the support at $2,427, then we have strong support at $2,204.     

Looking the other way, you can see how the resistance at $2,805 rejected the sudden upward movement, only when it overcomes it will it move towards the resistance at $2,987, and further towards the very strong resistance at $3,237.
___
We've taken out some buyside, failed to hold above 2.7K and we are currently trading below the HTF sellside and the FVG (yellow box). 

Taken some scalp on both sides of the market today and done for the day. 

Will look to see how we move from here. 

IF we reclaim the FVG expect us to push higher towards 3K and eventually higher. 
IF we fail to hold these current highs we will trade back towards 2.5K 

No need to FORCE YOUR WILL ON THE MARKET 

The overall trade idea on ETH remains unchanged. 

BE PATIENT...PLAN AND EXECUTE 

Stay safe and never risk more than 1-5% of your capital per trade. The following analysis is merely a price action based analysis and does not constitute financial advice in any form.

3. Reversal from 50% retracement area

1. choch then little bos

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum started to pump once the CPI data was published but immediately reversed. However, the price is still almost exactly in the middle of the (bearish) ascending channel.

The upper trend line is currently at 2.8k, which is equal to the resistance, while the lower trendline is at ~2.6k.

As long as we don't see a decisive move above or below the trend lines, we will still be in decision mode. Based on the chart pattern, I remain on the (short-term) bearish side and expect a break to the downside.

Let's see what the next hours and days will bring!

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà As per my last analysis, attached on the chart, ETH rejected the $2000 support zone and surged by over 25%.

What's next?

As long as the bulls hold, a movement towards the $3000 - $3100 resistance zone would be expected.

üìâ In parallel, if the last 4H low at $2600 is broken downward, a bearish movement towards the $2100 would be possible where we will be looking for new short-term longs.

Which scenario do you think is more likely to happen and why?

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà After breaking below the $3000 round number, ETH dipped by over 30%.

Currently, ETH is hovering around a strong rejection zone as it is the intersection of the $2000 round number and support, and the lower red trendline.

üèπ The highlighted red circle is a strong rejecting area to expect the bulls to kick in from.

 üìö As per my trading style: 
As #ETH approaches the red circle zone, I will be looking for bullish reversal setups (like a double bottom pattern, trendline break , and so on...)

Which scenario do you think is more likely to happen and why?

üìö  Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

Yello, Paradisers! Could #ETHUSDT be on the verge of a significant breakout or a sharp decline? Let's dive into the technicals.

üíé#ETHUSDT has been forming an ascending triangle, with multiple tests of both the support and resistance levels. The price has shown respect for its support zone, but what happens if the trendline doesn't hold?

üíéCurrently, ETHUSDT is respecting its support zone. However, if the trendline fails, the support at $2,527 will be crucial. The pair has probability to hold the support and soars again to resistance areas.

üíéThe pair has a strong probability of breaking out from the ascending triangle. If this happens, the first significant resistance to watch is at  $2,876 . Should the volume sustain, ETHUSDT could then target $3,068  and potentially even $3,331  .

üíéOn the flip side, if we see a candle close below the   $2,527   support, it will invalidate the bullish trend continuation. In this scenario, ETHUSDT may experience further downside pressure.

Stay vigilant, Paradisers. The market is volatile, and only the disciplined will thrive. But it never is, and never will be a free ride. Make sure you play it smart, Paradisers. Discipline, patience, robust strategies, and trading tactics are the only ways you can make it long-term in this market.

Trade smart, Paradisers! Stay focused, patient, and disciplined. This is the only way you will make it far in your crypto trading journey. Be a PRO

ETH: Possible growth, but very risky trade 

Technical analysis:
ETH is breaking out of a bullish pattern.

 It needs to rise above 2750 in order to get a better confirmation, but we probably won't. 

Today we have US CPI data and ETH may rise following speculative US CPI moves.

The first resistance zone is found near 2890, the second zone 3000 and a move above this 
critical level should push ETH further.

 You may find more details in the chart!

The market is buying back  BINANCE:ETHUSDT   after a big fall due to fear. Bulls kept the price below 2000 and now they are trying to keep it above 2500. The overall bullish backdrop is still in place..... 



A very promising technical situation is forming on W1. If the price returns to the global sideways range, we will have good prerequisites for a rise to 4000 - 4800. 
Fundamentally, everything is the same, the general background is bullish. The liquidation (strong downward movement) and the subsequent active buyback indicates that the market is free of unnecessary traders and the train can now move in the right direction, it remains to get to the key station before departure. 
The key stations are the 2717 - 2817 area. If the bulls can overcome this resistance and consolidate above, thus forming a strong support area and an intermediate bottom, then the market will have an important and promising liquidity target above 4000.

 Support levels: 2518, 2425, 2400
Resistance levels: 2717, 2817 

The whales continue to buy the asset after a strong fall, despite the fact that the chart looks bearish, there are key prerequisites indicating that the big players are still bullish. The focus is on the key resistance at 2717. After Friday's test and pullback, the price is back to the level, which increases the chances of a breakout. 

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:ETHUSD   ;)

This trade is based on a potential bullish reversal from a significant support level. The chart shows a strong rejection at the recent low around the 2,100 USDT level, which aligns with historical support, suggesting a possible reversal to the upside.

Entry:
Price: The entry for this trade is around 2,721.65 USDT, where the price is currently consolidating after testing support.

Target:
- Target Price: 4,091.91 USDT
- The target is set at a previous key resistance level, where price action has shown strong rejection in the past.

Stop Loss:
- Stop Loss: The stop loss is placed below the recent low at approximately 2,108.16 USDT, ensuring a risk-managed approach if the price breaks below the support level.

Let's have a look at ETH and how we are currently trading.

I've extended the HTF FVG (yellow box) and you can see that we are currently trading back within it. 

Overall plan remains the same. 

IF we manage to hold it expect us to trade back towards 2.8K and eventually higher towards the HTF buyside.
IF we fail to hold the current levels expect us to retrace back towards 2.5K. 

BE PATIENCE...PLAN AND EXECUTE 

Stay safe and never risk more than 1-5% of your capital per trade. The following analysis is merely a price action based analysis and does not constitute financial advice in any form.

Well, strap in, because we're about to blast off into the stratosphere of cryptocurrency analysis! üöÄ

According to the latest data, Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,672.89, with a projected increase of 5% in the next 30 days. That's a pretty solid boost, but is it enough to send ETH into orbit?

Well, let's take a look at the long-term predictions. By 2025, some experts are forecasting a potential high of $6,563, while others are even more bullish, predicting a whopping $10,200 by 2030. That's a lot of zeros, my friend!

But before we start counting our digital chickens, let's not forget that the crypto market is about as predictable as a cat on a caffeine high. There are a lot of factors at play here, including the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the approval of Ethereum ETFs, and the overall state of the global economy.

So, can ETH rocket from this level? The short answer is: maybe. The long answer is: it depends on a bunch of different variables, and even the experts can't agree on a definitive answer.

In the meantime, why not sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride? After all, isn't the journey to the moon (or at least the top of the crypto charts) half the fun?

‚úÖ Due To The Previous Update ,We Had a Perfect Bounce From The 2560$ Area To The 2720$ But The Price Was Not Able To Breakout From This Area And Rejected 

üìâ Currently Triple Top Formed At The 2720$ Zone And Also Impulsive Cycle Is Completed At This This Point ,So I Expect a Leg Down Toward a 2340$ As a Wave 2 Low Then New Bullish Move Toward a 3k ,Totally The ETH Chart Is Not Bullish In Here

üìä#ETH is bullish, where are the new trading opportunities‚ùì

üß†From a structural perspective, the double-top bearish structure built near the resistance area has been destroyed, so we are left with only a bullish expectation. In the future, we will mainly focus on the bullish trend.

‚û°Ô∏èAlthough we are bullish, we are currently near the resistance zone, so we need to be conservative if we are bullish. If we could get back into the buy zone below, we would buy without hesitation. üìà

‚û°Ô∏èAlthough we are bullish, it does not mean that we will give up short trades. If we return to the resistance zone again and do not break through the previous high, we will consider placing some short orders. üìâ

Ok. Our "baseline" price was hit perfectly and the way we found this level was simply by projecting a line from the prices traded near January 2024 to the right. Since there was resistance on the way up, we concluded that there would be support on the way down. Sure enough, Ethereum wicked below this level but closed exactly in a mirror fashion as compared to the range it traded at in late 2023 before a strong rise. It is always the same but in reverse.

If you look at the left side of the chart, in early December 2023 Ethereum starts to "push up," upward pressure, buying pressure, bullish momentum. But there is some resistance to remove and it keeps on pushing and in January 2024 it continues pushing higher... It takes a while before all the resistance is removed and higher prices are possible. This is normal.

When Ethereum crashed earlier this month, it produced a long lower wick, support is being challenged. It will keep on pushing down, downward pressure, selling pressure, bearish momentum, until the support breaks. It is the same but in reverse.

The level at which Ethereum found support is exactly the 0.618 Fib. retracement level for the entire bullish wave. Almost amazing the exactitude of these levels. As if nature already had it all planned.

Ethereum is set to continue lower. If the support level doesn't break right away it will continue to be challenged, over and over, again and again, until it breaks. One of the main reasons why Ethereum is going much lower is just because people cannot believe it. People can't believe it, they think it is impossible but the owners of Ethereum, the exchanges, the whales, the institutions and the rest can really use a low price. They see it as nice and attractive and they have no problem at all with a low price. In fact, they welcome a low price. Knowing this, they can short the market easily and willingly and then buy again much lower. They are in no hurry and there is no reason to hurry. Think about it! Who is in a hurry? Only Peter and Johny who bought crypto for speculative purposes and getting rich quick mentality want this to grow fast. The developers and owners want it strong and stable, the professional traders and speculators simply want what is best for their pockets, smart money adapt to market conditions and this is what we have going right now.

Lower prices are welcome by the entire population of market participants but a very small few. This small few are the minority in some sense of the word and they are about to get a big surprise. Ethereum has been growing since June 2022, which is more than two years, and thus they cannot imagine it really crashing as it is about to do. This lack of imagination is one of the main drivers of the current situation. If people were aware, alive and active with the different potential scenarios things would develop much more differently.

I am going into details really just to enlighten and entertain you but it is just crashing, plain and simple. And this is good because Ethereum is one of the giants and money flowing out of Ethereum will support the smaller altcoins and smaller projects that have been neglected for a long while, and, Ethereum will surely recover to become better and stronger in the years to come.

To be honest, we love Ethereum, we love Bitcoin, we love Crypto and we just can't do without. We want to see the market grow, we want to see it evolve, we want to see it higher, we want it more and more and more, but we can read the charts now and the charts are saying down and so we translate what the charts are saying so that you can prepare and make the most of your journey in this game.

It is a game, even though a complex one, it is a game and if you are going to be around and enjoy; learn to play.

Namaste.

As I mentioned in my previous update, it looks like ETH is trading in a bear flag. It looked somewhat decent after the bounce from 2.5k yesterday but now it's stalling and moving slow, which is typical for a bear flag. Still think we will see one more push towards 3k later this week but it could also drop down from here. 

Anyway, assuming we are in a bear flag one should wait for either of these scenarios:

- Break of the bear flag and wait for a bottom, which should be around 2.2k in this case

- Wait for a final touch of upper resistance and go short

You really don't want to trade the price action within a bear flag, as it's completely random - And you don't want to short the breakdown, as it just could move back inside for a stop hunt. 

So either trying to catch a bottom AFTER breakdown or wait for the upper bounds and go short, which should be around 3k.

Stay safe!

Ethereum bounced off the lower boundary of ascending channel. Bullish movement to resistance level at 2750 is possible.
___
PHEMEX:ETHUSDT.P   recently breached its $2800 support level before rebounding to the $2700 range. This significant drop has transformed the previously supportive $2800 level into a formidable resistance barrier, currently preventing further upward momentum. Unlike Bitcoin, which experienced a notable price surge following the launch of its ETF, Ethereum's ETF has thus far failed to ignite a similar rally.

Given the current market dynamics, several potential price trajectories for ETH emerge:

 Bullish Scenario 
A decisive breakout above the $2800 resistance could signal renewed bullish sentiment. However, substantial selling pressure is anticipated at the $3300 and $3600 levels, which could hinder sustained upward movement. Without a catalyst such as significant positive news or a broader market uptrend, overcoming these resistance zones will be challenging.

 Bearish Outlook 
Alternatively, ETH might undergo a downward correction, potentially retesting the $2000 support level. This level could serve as a consolidation area before a potential rebound. If bearish pressure intensifies, a breakdown below $2000 to the $1800 level cannot be ruled out, though such a scenario warrants caution.

 Range-bound Movement 
A more likely scenario involves ETH consolidating between the $2500 and $2800 levels. This sideways price action can offer opportunities for range-bound trading strategies, such as the use of Neutral Grid bots. However, implementing stop-loss orders at both $2500 and $2800 is crucial to manage risk effectively. For investors seeking more pronounced price movements, adopting a wait-and-see approach until a clear directional bias emerges may be prudent.

Ultimately, the future trajectory of ETH will depend on a confluence of factors, including overall market sentiment, investor behavior, and the impact of regulatory developments.

In today's post I'd like to invite you to add the alts YOU think will survive, and why. Add in the comment section! 

 Incase you missed yesterdays post... 

I remember the good 'ol days, when the amount of options you had was limited to one hand.
First there was Bitcoin. Then came ETH, LTC, XRP and BCH (Bitcoin Cash). And a few other's later came like Bitcoin Gold and CRV. But oh man, were those the days. Crypto felt oddly "safer" back then, despite mt gox and pyramid schemes running rampant. Because today - the enemy is actually in the camp...

New alts are being released every hour (probably more) and it's just the one airdrop to the next rug. Lot's of progress has been made in this space which is blockchain, but we're still not really seeing the original promise of Bitcoin being fulfilled (fast and affordable cross border payments, ) amongst others.

Today, it has become close to impossible to separate the crop from the cream in terms of coin accumulation. If you bought BTC two years ago, or ETH, or LTC - you'd currently be in profit. However, some alts don't even exist for a month after release date never the less a year or more.

So let's talk about which altcoins I believe have a future FOR SURE. Remember that this is a highly debatable point; but I am going to point out the few that I believe will survive (at least past year and possibly beyond).

üëâ1) Bitcoin 

Bitcoin is not an altcoin, it is the original crypto. The KING. The first commandment and promise of a fair, open and transparent future on the blockchain. BTC's price may be overvalued occasionally, but it will always have the benefit of being first. And with so many institutional investors, I think it's a safe play for the foreseeable future.

üëâ 2) Ethereum 

King of the alts, first of it's kind. Ethereum is the world's first smart contract platforms which remains the most popular choice among developers even today. Following Bitcoin's decentralized concept, Ethereum has become a leader in smart contract platforms and dApps. Eth is here to stay.

üëâ 3) Solana 

Competitor now to Ethereum, SOL has previously surpassed ETH (not in price). With over 95 million transactions daily, Solana has become the fastest blockchain and recently surpassed Ethereum in Total Economic Value. Many devs prefer Solana, and I believe it will stick around for the foreseeable future.

üëâ4) Dogecoin 

I hate how dependent Doge is on Elon Musk. But, for some reason, Mr Musk has a fascination with Doge and has promised many times to include it as a payment option on X (formerly Twitter). Even though it seems like a pie in the sky, something like that would significantly increase the value of Doge. I don't see it as a "forever" coin, but definitely on the list.

I think a key point to note here, is that back then, they (the founders) were doing something revolutionary. They were and are the titans of the industry. Today, anyone with GPT can create a functioning alt that "serves a purpose" or has "fundamental use case" in some way. It's true that AI is revolutionary, and I am very bullish on the concept of AI and the promise of automation for human kind. But this far, it hasn't been profitable, yet.

OpenAI makes losses and cryptoai is just leveraging off the larger AI, or the concept thereof... Sure, there are privately trained models, but at the current moment it takes a tremendous amount of resources (time, money, physical space) to do DL or Machine Learning, which if OpenAI cant make profitable... then neither can the cryptoai created by john, steve and bob.

 10 Other ALTS that will probably make it past this year: 

1) Shiba Inu (because people love it) 

2) XRP (because many can't let go) 

3) Cardano (because it has a cult following) 

4) BNB (Binance supporters maybe?) 

5) Chainlink (because oddly enough it's survived for this long) 

 You wouldn't catch me dead holding those 5, but still - I do believe they will survive for some time still.
Now, coins that I will actually buy and hold: 


6) Kaspa (potentially a revolutionary alt) 

7) Render (potentially an ai winner) 

8) Monero (still the best privacy coin) 

9) Sei (potentially a revolutionary alt) 

10) Aave (still the best for borrowing and lending) 

Don't miss the message here - you can still TRADE altcoins. There are good trading opportunities
and setups even for the worst alts. I know this because we trade them daily. But this post is not about trading opportunities - it's about the future, potentially the far future. Who will likely survive and why. Alts that may be worth accumulating an that probably won't rug in a month's time.

 I hope you can take it for what it is intended to be!

üîç ETH/USDT 1-Hour Chart: Strategic Timing for Longs and Profit-Taking üöÄ 

The 1-hour ETH/USDT chart highlights key moments for traders and investors. The green line marks the optimal time for entering long positions or accumulating, with ETH expected to correct locally. Red lines signal potential local peaks, ideal for profit-taking.

On higher timeframes, the weekly chart suggests that the current bull run's local peak could hit on August 15th, with the best long-term entry before the next Bitcoin halving likely not until January 2027. Timing your moves wisely could maximize gains in these critical periods.

hello guys.

let's analyze Ethereum coin.

  1. Price Action & Market Structure:
    - The price has been in a downtrend, followed by a strong bounce from a key support level around 2,527.05 USDT.
   - A bullish channel has formed as the price is making higher highs and higher lows, indicating a potential recovery in progress.

  2. Key Levels:
    - Flip Area: The chart notes a flip area where the price was expected to move downward but instead failed to do so, suggesting this level has turned into a strong support.
   - Target Area: The chart identifies a target area of around 3,081.55 USDT. This area is likely a resistance level where the price could encounter selling pressure if it continues to rise.

  3. Bullish Channel:
    - The price is moving within a rising channel, with a potential bullish continuation if the channel is maintained. The channel suggests the price could continue to rise, with pullbacks likely finding support near the lower trendline of the channel.
   - The chart projects a possible movement pattern within this channel, suggesting the price may pull back slightly before moving higher toward the target area.

  4. Projection:
    - The price is likely to continue its upward trajectory within the bullish channel, with a potential target around 2,816.25 USDT first and then 3,081.55 USDT.
   - A break below the channel could indicate a potential bearish reversal while maintaining the channel, which could see further upside.

  Summary in Bullet Points
 
- Bullish Channel: Price is currently moving in a rising channel, indicating a bullish recovery.
- Key Support: Strong support around 2,527.05 USDT, previously expected to push the price down, has held firm.
- Resistance Levels: Watch for potential resistance at 2,816.25 USDT and the target area around 3,081.55 USDT.
- Outlook: As long as the price stays within the channel, the outlook remains bullish with possible targets above.

üìä#ETH is blocked by the resistance zone, what‚Äôs next‚ùì

üß† We started to rebound after getting support near the neckline as expected, but unfortunately we failed to break through the blue resistance zone to continue the bullish power, so the long orders we got near the neckline were swept away after the stop loss was moved up. dropped.

‚û°Ô∏èStructurally, we have constructed a double-top bearish structure near the resistance zone, so there is the possibility of a deeper pullback. But there is a contradiction as there is also a bullish double bottom structure on the 4-hour chart.

‚û°Ô∏èSince there is a conflict, we need to wait patiently for the conflict to be resolved before participating in new transactions. If you, like me, hold short positions in relatively good positions, then you can reduce your holdings and then look forward to the possibility of deeper adjustments.

By examining the #Ethereum chart in the weekly timeframe (logarithmic), we observe that last week, the price entered the desired demand zone and, after dropping to $2110, encountered buying pressure again. Currently, it has managed to rise over 20% and is trading around $2500. As you know, this support level is crucial for the beginning of the next bullish trend, and if the price stabilizes above this zone, we can expect further upward movement to higher levels.

(1) $2100 is the best entry if fell again
(2) ETH is running  Elliott Impulse Wave, and just completed the 1st and 2nd wave
(3) 3rd wave will come around 9/E, and reach its high in Jan ~ March 2025
(4) The low of 4th wave can be seen in April ~ June 2025
(5) The high of 5th wave can be seen in Oct ~ Nov 2025
(6) Keep being patient

A large sidewall has formed from above, which means that a sufficient number of positions for movement have been collected. As we continue to pull back from the big drop, I expect to see at least one more top above 2800. 
It is best to enter on sharp declines, for me it is the range of 2510-2480

Ethereum Analysis 

üí∞ Welcome to Your Channel!
Welcome to our channel where we delve into the intricacies of financial markets. Today, we focus on ETH/USDT, dissecting its current price action to uncover strategic trading opportunities. Join us as we analyze key levels and market dynamics, aiming to refine our trading strategies and maximize potential gains.

üí° Previous Analysis Review:
In the last analysis, Ethereum experienced a significant sell-off, taking out the previous month‚Äôs low (PML) and capturing sell-side liquidity (SSL). Following this move, Ethereum expanded higher, and the price is now consolidating in a crucial range.

üìçCurrent Market Overview:
Ethereum is currently trading around 2,649.20, navigating within a critical zone marked by a buy-side liquidity (BSL) and sell-side liquidity (SSL). Additionally, a 4-hour Fair Value Gap (FVG) exists around the 2,370 level, presenting a potential area for price retracement.

üîç Identifying Key Levels
‚Ä¢ PML (Previous Month Low): 2,645 ‚Äì recently swept.
‚Ä¢ PMH (Previous Month High): 3,567 ‚Äì a possible target on a bullish breakout.
‚Ä¢ PWH (Previous Week High): 3,385 ‚Äì key resistance level.
‚Ä¢ BSL (Buy-Side Liquidity): Around 2,706 ‚Äì acting as resistance.
‚Ä¢ SSL (Sell-Side Liquidity): At 2,535 and 2,206 ‚Äì significant support levels.
‚Ä¢ 4H FVG: Located around 2,370 ‚Äì potential retracement zone.

üìä Key Considerations
‚Ä¢ Current Price Position: Ethereum trades at 2,649.20, close to the BSL level.
‚Ä¢ 4H FVG Reaction: A 4-hour FVG at 2,370 is a critical level to watch for price reactions.
‚Ä¢ Consolidation Phase: Ethereum is consolidating, suggesting an impending move.

üìà Bullish Scenario
A bullish scenario might unfold if:

‚Ä¢ Retracement into the 4H FVG: Price could retrace into the 4H FVG at 2,370 and find support, potentially leading to a rally.
‚Ä¢ Sweep of SSL: A sweep of the SSL at 2,535 or lower could indicate a liquidity grab, setting the stage for a move higher.
‚Ä¢ Formation of Higher Lows: If the price establishes higher lows above the SSL, it may signal a bullish continuation.

üìâ Bearish Scenario
A bearish scenario could develop if:

‚Ä¢ Sweep of BSL: If the price sweeps the BSL at 2,706 but fails to hold above it, it could indicate a bearish reversal.
‚Ä¢ Break Below 4H FVG: A break below the 4H FVG at 2,370 might suggest further downside potential.
‚Ä¢ Lower Time Frame Confirmation: Watching for confirmations on lower time frames could provide early signs of a bearish trend.

üìä Chart Analysis Summary
‚Ä¢ Bullish Expectation: A successful retracement into the 4H FVG or a sweep of the SSL could provide a foundation for a bullish rally.
‚Ä¢ Bearish Expectation: A sweep of the BSL without sustaining the level or a failure at the 4H FVG could lead to further declines.

üìù Conclusion:
Ethereum's price is positioned at a crucial juncture, with potential for both bullish and bearish outcomes. Monitoring the reactions at the BSL, 4H FVG, and SSL levels will be key to understanding the next market direction.

ETH: Next Target 3000 

Price completed a bullish harmonic pattern with an overextended D leg , created over the past week by high price volatility.

The price is again in the correction and is getting ready to go higher again and maybe it can reach the 3000 target soon.

The current price has found a strong support zone between 2555 - 2590. If the price will hold this zone, then the next target should be 3000 which is also a strong psychological price zone for all traders.

 You may find more details in the chart!

As you can see when took out some HTF sellside and we are currently trading back above our annotated level. 

Let's see where the market wants to go from here...

Overall plan remains the same

IF we reclaim and hold above 2.5K expect some further pa towards 3K. 
IF we fail to hold the current highs we should revisit the HTF sellside sitting around 1.8K 

TRADE THE MARKET...THE REST IS JUST NOISE and like we noted last time...'don't be fooled by all the news titles and everyone calling recession this...recession that...WE TRADE THE CHARTS AND THE MARKET...No silly titles and overhyped sensations...'

hello guys!

the news forced the price dump!

  1. Double Top Completion:
    - Description: The double top pattern projected a target of $2,100, which the price has successfully reached. This indicates that the bearish move triggered by this pattern has played out.
   - Outcome: Since the target has been met, the selling pressure may decrease, and we could see consolidation or a potential reversal.

  2. Current Support Zone:
    - Description: The price is now hovering slightly above $2,100, at around $2,280. This area could act as a new support zone, especially since it aligns with the long-term upward trendline.
   - Outcome: If this support holds, the market may enter a consolidation phase, with potential for a bullish reversal if buying pressure increases.

  3. Next Potential Move:
    - Bullish Scenario: If the price continues to hold above the $2,100-$2,280 support range, and if it breaks above the nearby resistance zone ($2,500-$2,700), it could signal the start of a new upward move, potentially targeting higher levels like $3,000 or beyond.
   - Bearish Scenario: If the support around $2,100 breaks, the price might test lower levels. The next significant support could be around $1,800, which was previously highlighted as a strong support zone.

  Summary:
 - Completion of Bearish Move: The target of $2,100 being hit marks the completion of the double top pattern's bearish move.
- Critical Support Level: The $2,100-$2,280 zone is now a critical support area to watch.
- Market Direction: The next direction will likely depend on whether the price can hold this support and break above resistance, or if it will fail and move lower.

 Traders should monitor these levels closely to gauge the market's next move.

Late night session not over yet. Want to bid this FVG on ETH. Looking for the demand or the FVG to hold. Target is yet to be announced but MDay-H range is a good target. Let's see what we get.

 Analysis of the Chart: 
Fair Value Gap (FVG):
The 30-minute Fair Value Gap (FVG) is a key zone of interest. This area represents a price imbalance that the market may revisit to fill, providing a potential entry point.

 
 Demand Zone:
 
Just below the FVG, a 30-minute demand zone is identified. This area signifies strong buying interest that could act as support and push the price higher.

 
 Break of Structure (BOS):
 
Multiple Breaks of Structure (BOS) are highlighted, indicating critical points where the market trend shifted from bearish to bullish. These BOS levels provide additional confirmation of the market's directional bias.

 
 Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP):
 
VWAPs are used in the chart instead of moving averages. VWAPs help to identify the average price weighted by volume, providing dynamic support and resistance levels.

The target is yet to be announced, but the MDay-H (Midday High) range is considered a good initial target. This level represents a previous significant high, providing a logical area for the price to aim for.

üß†It is impossible to chase the rise at present, because we have reached the stage resistance zone and there is an expectation of a correction, so if you want to be bullish, you have to wait for a period of correction before considering it.

ETH technical analysis update

ETH's price touched the trend support line on the weekly chart and has bounced 20% from it. The price also touched the April resistance level at $2,150, which is now acting as strong support.
Price dropped below 30 RSI in day chart, this could indicate the bottom for ETH. The 100 and 200 EMA act as agood support for ETH in weekly chart. We can expect a significant bullish move from the current level, with the potential to reach a new all-time high in the coming months.

Ethereum is constantly making lower H's and L's. The larger structure is bearish as you can see.

You can look for sell/short positions in the premium range.

Closing a daily candle above the invalidation level will violate the analysis.

Note that the financial market is risky, so:
Do not enter a position without setting a stop and capital management and confirmation and trigger.

In my analysis of the Ethereum (ETH/USDT) daily chart, I've identified key technical elements that are crucial for understanding the current market dynamics. Firstly, it's important to note the failure of the Ichimoku calculation, which may necessitate reapplication or adjustment for a clearer analysis.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a strong bearish momentum, indicated by the significant separation between the MACD line and the signal line, with the histogram trending downward. This suggests that the selling pressure has been increasing, potentially leading to further declines if not reversed soon.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 37.42, which is below the midline of 50 but not yet in the oversold territory (below 30). This positioning indicates that while there is bearish momentum, there might be room for further downward movement before the market is technically considered oversold.

From the price action, we observe that ETH has recently broken below the support level at $3,043, now acting as resistance (R1). This breakdown could signal a continued bearish trend towards the next support level (S1) at $2,126.90. If this level fails to hold, the decline could extend further, potentially testing much lower supports.

For potential recovery scenarios, ETH would need to reclaim and stabilize above $3,043 to alleviate immediate bearish pressure. A move above this level could open the path towards the next resistance at $4,105.80 (R2). However, given the current market conditions indicated by the MACD and RSI, such a bullish reversal might require significant volume and positive market catalysts.

In conclusion, the current technical setup suggests caution for ETH traders, with an emphasis on monitoring the $2,126.90 support level closely. A break below this could lead to significant losses, while a recovery above $3,043 might signal a short-term bullish reversal. As always, it's crucial to consider external market factors and news that could influence price movements beyond what technical indicators alone can predict.
___
We are in the reversal range, so locally you can consider such a trade, the ratio of 1 to 15 looks quite good
___
If you concur with my analysis, you'll join me in shorting ETH at around 3300, anticipating a price of 2400. If you agree, consider taking this approach.
If you do take this approach and recognize the value of seizing a trading opportunity, be sure to come back and support it with a like.
___
As mentioned in today's live session and post, I don't expect Ethereum to stay at the current level for much longer.

The 1H chart shows a clear pattern that is about to break during the next hours. However, it is currently hard to forecast whether we will break up or down. 

A bullish breakout should send ETH to the 2.8k resistance, while a bearish drop might push ETH to the 2.1 level.

Overall, the market recovery seems to be losing some steam at the moment. Bitcoin, for example, printed some reversal candles on the 4H chart, too. Accordingly, the probability of a break to the downside is higher.

However, with the U.S. markets opening in two hours, we could see a bullish impulse, too.

Therefore, I would remain VERY cautious when entering new trades at this level!
___
Based on this trading indicator attached to the chart - Ethereum looks like it is ready to move downwards in the next few days + weeks towards the next resistance levels.

This is a great selling opportunity with profitable potential!
___
Ethereum bounced down off the resistance area. Asset broke trough the ascending trendline. Bearish movement to support level at 2200 is expected to happen.
___
The recent candlestick with the large volume is a long red candle followed by a smaller green candle, which is a sign of potential short-term bottoming. However, this needs to be confirmed by further price action in the coming days.

The chart shows a significant spike in volume on the recent large red candle, which indicates a strong selling pressure. This suggests a potential capitulation or panic sell, followed by a slight recovery.

 Decision Making: 
For Holders: Given the higher probability of an upward movement, holding ETH might be a favorable decision, but the presence of a significant downward risk suggests that setting stop-loss orders or partial profit-taking strategies could help manage risk.
For Potential Buyers: The data suggests a favorable probability for entering a position, especially if you are prepared to handle potential short-term volatility.

#ETHUSDT - UniverseMetta - Analysis


Clear boundaries of the sideways trend in which the price has been since March are visible. There was also a withdrawal of liquidity from the February lows. You can try to add an asset to your portfolio. For speculative positions, we can consider H4, the formation of a 3-wave structure in continuation of the upward movement, to the upper border of the sideways trend. If the price fixes above the border and retests the level, it will be possible to consider purchases with a target of 6084. To cancel the idea or purchase additional assets, it is better to consider a breakout of the nearest minimums.

Target 3700 - 6084

The ETH/USDT weekly update shows a bearish breakdown below a key support level, with the price currently at $2,502.09. Ethereum is approaching an ascending trendline, a crucial support level. Failure to hold this level could cause the price to drop to around $2,000. Conversely, a bounce off this trendline could face resistance at the previous support level of $2,800. Traders should keep an eye on volume and RSI signals to gauge the strength of the current downtrend and potential reversal points.

#ETH corrected similarly to #BTC after ETF approvals. It absorbed all the liquidity from the 2024 consolidation and is now attempting a climb.

We might see a price increase to liquidate shorts, but a retest of the 2288 zone is also possible.

In the event of a new low, DCA zones are crucial, and it's essential for the price not to open a daily candle below 1800.

For sell zones, we first need to see support at the 3200-3300 range; only then can we discuss a new ATH.

market structure is pretty clear here, i‚Äôll short at 2607, watching price action of course

Let's look at short-term version of Ethereum; Let's see what the chart has to say.

‚ûñ We know we are dealing with a bearish impulse based on the strength of the bearish move and its volume.

‚ûñ If we think in terms of Elliott Wave Theory and a five wave pattern, we can say that we just witnessed the third wave, based on the strong volume. Meaning, "the third wave always has the highest volume."

‚ûñ We have a 40% drop in 11 days.

‚ûñ A bounce is now in place; a normal market reaction.
ETHUSDT grew 20% on the bounce.

‚ûñ A bounce following a bearish impulse can range between 15-35%. Depending on the strength of the bears.

A stronger bounce or recovery would produce stronger bullish candles and momentum. As the chart it is, it seems something is missing...

We know based on intuitive perception and ten years of experience tracking the markets that the bearish move is not over. The bounce can extend, variability and volatility is always there, I can be wrong; but, everything is pointing toward lower prices.

‚ûñ 0.5 Fib. retracement = ~$2,830.
‚ûñ 0.382 Fib. retracement = $2,665.

These are key levels and likely left unchallenged.
If prices move higher, keep those in mind for short.

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.

Hello, traders.

If you "Follow", you can always get new information quickly.

Please click "Boost" as well.
Have a nice day today.

-------------------------------------

(1M Chart)

You can see that the 2531.05 ~ 0.382 (2647.80) section is an important section.

If it falls in this section, it is likely to turn into a downtrend in the long term, so be careful when trading.

-
(1W chart)

If it falls in the 2531.05 ~ 0.382 (2647.80) range, it is likely to eventually touch the HA-Low indicator on the 1W chart.

Therefore, as the price falls, we need to check at what point the HA-Low indicator is generated.

If not, it is expected to fall to around 1340.12, where the HA-Low indicator is currently located.

However, we need to check for support near the 2159.00 point (the bottom point of the HA-High indicator box on the 1M chart) and the 1783.0 point (the top point of the HA-Low indicator box on the 1W chart).

If it rises, it is likely to face resistance near 3265.0-3321.30, so we need to check for support.

-
(1D chart)

It is a medium-term rising channel, that is, it has entered a short-term falling channel while falling from the rising trend line (1) ~ (2) section.

This short-term falling channel is a channel made up of high-point trend lines.

Therefore, if it falls from this channel, it is thought that it is likely to record another large decline.

That is why the key is whether there is support near the 1783.0-2159.0 section.

-
When making new purchases, it is recommended to check whether there is support near the HA-Low indicator on the 1D chart if possible.

Currently, the HA-Low indicator is formed at the 3079.59 point.

However, since there is a high possibility that a new HA-Low indicator will be created depending on price fluctuations, I think it is better to wait for it to be created at some point.

-
The time to buy is when StochRSI > StochRSI EMA and the StochRSI indicator is out of the oversold zone, and you can proceed by checking whether there is support at the support and resistance points.

Currently, I think it is most likely to check whether there is support above the 2531.05 ~ 0.382 (2647.80) range.

If it falls,
1st: 2159.0
2nd: 1783.0
You should check whether there is support near the 1st and 2nd above.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin when it rises above 29K.

The range expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

Ethereum is presently positioned above a pivotal support line that delineates the current trend. Recently, the coin experienced a rejection from its proximate resistance level. 

Anticipation of a subsequent rejection upon a retest of this level is warranted. Should this rejection materialize, focus should pivot to the immediate BUY BACK ZONE for potential re-accumulation strategies. The aforementioned trend-defining support line is recognized as a substantial level of interest; while it is expected to sustain price levels, a breach below this threshold would necessitate reliance on the underlying strong demand zone to uphold the asset's value. 

Subsequent to stabilizing within this demand zone, the target shifts towards surpassing the current all-time high (ATH), with the current price action suggesting the formation of a potential 'cup' pattern.

Additionally, analysis of the wave pattern within this context reveals the completion of waves one through four, setting the stage for the initiation of the fifth and final wave. This development is pivotal for the formation of the concluding leg of the wave sequence.

 Engagement through likes and comments on this analysis is highly valued and appreciated. Thank you for your attention and contributions.

ETH has made a number of attempts to break past resistance and is making higher pivot lows.
It has surpassed numerous levels where heavy volume was transacted with higher volumes on the up moves than down moves, so is exhibiting bullish characteristics.
The failure of the next attempts followed by high selling volumes, could however indicate capitulation to the bears.

Here I have the monthly Ether chart (ETHUSDT).

‚ûñ Notice how the drop lands perfectly at 0.618 Fib. retracement for the entire bullish wave that started June 2022.

‚ûñ The month is early, really early. The month is starting just now and things are not looking good, from many perspectives, in the coming weeks.

‚ûñ A target range of $1750 - $1550 for the bearish wave is now active.

This is just a friendly reminder... It can get worse...  Patience is key! 

Namaste.

Here the leverage can now be increased. It doesn't matter if you entered before or after the peak, if you are doing it short or long-term; this is easy profits.

Ethereum seems to be headed lower based on chart signals and lots of data we looked at in previous weeks. 

The correction might end up being boring... I think nobody is going to like seeing the market red, so we will have to detach, go away and comeback when we are ready for the next bullish wave.

The interesting part though will be to find out if the correction low will come in after three months or two weeks... We can only wait and see.

This chart is showing bearish potential.

Analyzing the current market conditions for ETH/USDT, there are several technical indicators suggesting that Ethereum might be poised for a significant upward movement from its current price of $2,444. The recent sharp decline in price has brought Ethereum to a crucial support level, which has historically acted as a strong foundation for upward reversals.

Firstly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below the 30 level due to the recent sell-off, indicating that Ethereum is currently in oversold territory. This suggests that the selling pressure may have been overextended, providing a potential opportunity for buyers to enter the market and capitalize on the discounted price.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also starting to show signs of a bullish crossover. The MACD line is approaching the signal line from below, which often precedes a bullish trend reversal. This potential crossover, coupled with the oversold RSI, strengthens the case for a price rebound.

Additionally, the Bollinger Bands have expanded significantly during the recent price drop, reflecting increased volatility. However, the price has begun to stabilize around the lower band, suggesting that the downward momentum is waning and a reversal could be on the horizon.

Furthermore, the trading volume has spiked dramatically during the sell-off, indicating heightened market interest and participation. Historically, high volume during price declines can precede reversals as it suggests that new buyers are stepping in to absorb the selling pressure.

The Fibonacci retracement levels also align with this analysis, as the price is currently hovering around the 61.8% retracement level from the previous rally. This level is often considered a strong support area where price reversals are likely to occur.

From a fundamental perspective, Ethereum continues to see strong network activity and development progress, further supporting the potential for a rebound. The recent pullback may have been driven by broader market sentiment rather than any Ethereum-specific issues, providing an attractive entry point for long-term investors.

Given these factors, it seems like an opportune moment to consider buying ETH/USDT in anticipation of a medium-term price increase. The combination of oversold conditions, technical support levels, and strong fundamental backing suggests that Ethereum is well-positioned to recover from its recent dip and potentially target new highs in the coming weeks and months.

While everyone is bearish and scared of ww3 and BOJ, longs from this pivot level will print until at least 2860 resistance. Open interest shows us that this was major liqudation event and that all longs that accumulated and ran price to the 3500 are out of the game. Negative fundings shows us that shorts are pilling after that event (right now OI cant show us data because we need at least candles of data so funding is best for the current momentum of what is happening). Also fear and greed indicator is showing max fear. While 2130 is very important level as we pivoted few times from it, bouncing exactly from it means a lot and will probably give us a run to at least 2860 resistance, maybe even way more which I will update!
___
Is it too early to start planning for the next bullish wave?
When is the best time to start buying?

Good Sunday my fellow traders, we have a volcano erupting in Italy today...

Ethereum is now challenging a critical support which can lead to prices moving to "baseline," which coincides with the same level at which Ether traded back in January in this year.

Is this baseline the right level at which one can start accumulating? 
Maybe.

‚ûñ The baseline is a very strong support level so a bounce is bound to happen at this point but, there can be even lower prices because we are set to experience 6-8 weeks of red and so far we've only experienced one.

‚ûñ While the baseline is surely to produce a reaction that will push prices up, it is better to wait for the accumulation range to develop which will in-turn reveal the perfect price range that will be made available before long-term growth.

üëâ Ethereum has the potential to hit beyond $10,000 (~$12,555) in 2025... We need to stay vigilant in order to spot the low to prepare for LONG.

Namaste.

I'm bullish on Ethereum (ETH) and believe it's a good time to buy. Here are some key reasons: 

Strong Fundamentals: Ethereum's continued development, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, promises 

Institutional Interest: Growing interest from institutional investors and increased exposure through ETFs and other financial products add credibility and stability to Ethereum's market position.

Macro Environment: The broader crypto market is showing resilience, and Ethereum, being a key player, is poised to benefit from this positive sentiment. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, such as inflation concerns and fiat currency depreciation, may drive more investors toward cryptocurrencies as a hedge.
___
Ethereum (ETH) plummeted to the January lows over the past few hours. Its descent below $2.9k was followed by a 27.5% drop over the next 12 hours.

At press time, ETH has bounced to $2366 from the $2.1k lows, a 12.17% bounce.

The smart money that bought close to $20 million when prices were at $2.9k and $3.1k has not been correct this time, smudging a previously perfect track record.

The price crash of the past couple of days was brutal. In just the last 24 hours, Ethereum markets saw $346.5 million worth of liquidations. The daily RSI fell to 19, the lowest since 18th August 2023.

The daily session has not yet closed, but as things stand, the rally earlier this year has been wholly retraced. The $2.5k-$2.6k zone is likely to serve as resistance on the way upward.

The OBV formed a new low to encapsulate the idea of extreme selling volume. The day‚Äôs trading volume is 1.55 million ETH and counting, the highest in 2024.

While it might be a good reason to buy, more conservative traders and investors would want to see prices reclaim key support zones and stay above them for a few days before they‚Äôre confident enough to bid.

Market crashes like these are not a good time to be in a leveraged trade, as 270k+ crypto traders found out over the weekend. The Open Interest has fallen from $9.9 billion on the 3rd of August to $7.35 billion at press time.

A bounce toward $2.5k was possible, but the New York trading session can see added selling pressure.
___
Given the political and economic challenges ahead, the crypto market is at risk of a significant drop. If the support level at $2800 does not hold during its next test, there is a high chance of falling to $2100. The market has formed a lower high in three consecutive attempts, and the failure to reverse at these levels would increase downward pressure. This, combined with the pressure on tech stocks in the US equity market, poses a major threat to the crypto market in the medium term.

We are closely monitoring this situation and the support level. Considering the volume has been consistently decreasing since March, we are on high alert. If the support breaks on the recent downtrend starting July 21st, we expect further declines. There are many warning signs across different markets, and until the economic and political climate stabilizes, we anticipate this downturn to continue until the US election.

üìäWhere is the best buying area for #ETH?‚ùì

üß† We pulled back as expected after completing the target of the weekly level bull structure. From a structural perspective, we have constructed a double top bearish structure in the sell zone, with the ideal target zone for this structure being 1643-2618.

‚û°Ô∏èIf we can reach this buying area directly, then we will plan to buy back the spot holdings reduced in the selling area again.

Really didn't see that coming but honestly, I think only a handful of people predicted this crash, if you are one of them, kudos to you. 

Now, I won't even bother trying to find out why it happened, it is what it is. I think the weak stock market open led to this liquidation event and as you all know, crypto markets are extremely leveraged, so nothing we haven't seen many many times. It's really hard to predict these events but luckily they don't happen that often, so if you survived this crash you definitely did something right. 

ETH dumped all the way down to 2200$ which is now our key level to look at. To the upside we have 2800 as our first big resistance but the real challenge would now be the 3k level when few days ago 3.4-3.6k was THE level to break but this crash puts everything into a different perspective and we must adapt to it. 

I mapped out three possible scenarios of what COULD happen coming days. One being a super bullish scenario (blue line), a somewhat neutral and more likely scenario (black line) and a bearish scenario (red line). 

Think they speak for itself, but I will give you a short explanatation:

Blue line (bullish): We close this day above ~2600-2700$ which will most likely indicate that the bottom is in.

Black line (neutral): For me the most likely right now, so basically a rather conventional scenario, where we would see ETH range between 2500-2700$ coming days and eventually break above 2800$

Red line (bearish): Retest 2800$ and see new lows, probably around the 2k level. 

I really don't know at this point but if you asked me I would give the bullish scenario a 10-15% chance as we have seen something similar on a few alts already (TIA, Storj, Ondo) 

As I said, I'm leaning towards the black line, so seeing another lower high around 2400-2500$ and from there we should see an attempt to break 2.8k

In all of these scenarios I see 3k as the biggest resistance ETH needs to break. I have no idea if it's going to happen, still too early but just wanted to give you an idea of what you can expect.

Stay safe!

Got stopped out on our ETH long swing trade. 

Entry 2700
TP 3985
SL 2300

As you'll have we've broken below 2.5K and like we noted yesterday...'a clean break and hold below 2.5K and the trade idea is invalidated' ...market aggressively traded through 2.5K and is currently ranging. 

Let's see where the market wants to go from here...

Overall plan remains the same so don't be fooled by all the news titles and everyone calling recession this...recession that...WE TRADE THE CHARTS AND THE MARKET...No silly titles and overhyped sensations...

IF we reclaim and hold above 2.5K I will look to re-enter and take the exact same trade. 
IF we fail to hold the current lows expect further downside towards 1.8K. 

Today is Monday and the week is still young...so BE PATIENT...PLAN AND EXECUTE 


Stay safe and never risk more than 1-5% of your capital per trade. The following analysis is merely a price action based analysis and does not constitute financial advice in any form.

It's made headlines that large whale wallets have sold off large chucks, driving the price of ETH down by over 35% in only a few days.

We see a yearly low in the daily RSI, as well as an "Oversold" flash on the Technical indicator.
The good news, is that this will give buyers a few weeks to re-accumulate ETH before the next impulse wave up starts:


For the short term, the price will likely continue to trade down the lower Bollinger Bands until the sell-off is over. Retail is catching on to the sell off, so it's likely we'll see wicky price action as this kind of volume will be attractive for algo trading.


For the SHORT and NEAR term I am bearish, but for the NEAR to LONG term I remain bullish that another impulse wave up is next.

If you haven`t sold the top on ETH:


Then you need to know that the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has announced that five spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are slated to begin trading on July 23, pending regulatory approval. 

However, the launch of these Ethereum ETFs could lead to a price decline similar to what was observed with Bitcoin. 

After the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, Bitcoin experienced a notable drop in its price. Initially, Bitcoin was trading above $48,000 but then plummeted to as low as $38,700 on January 23, 2024. 
This represents a nearly 20% decline from its high‚Äã‚Äã. The initial drop of 5% was observed shortly after the ETFs went live, attributed to profit-taking behavior and market dynamics‚Äã.

For Ethereum, a similar scenario could unfold. The influx of capital and the heightened attention could initially drive up prices. However, once the ETFs start trading, profit-taking behavior might set in, potentially causing Ethereum's price to fall by 5% to 20%.

Investors should be prepared for potential volatility surrounding the launch date. 

My Price Target is $2800.
___
ETH still continue moving down, not a lot of buy to push the price up at this price but there is a zone to sell.

I get stuck on my own way of thinking... In my own unique way of seeing things.

Whenever I develop a market perspective, there is no way to get out of it... That's a problem, a true problem for somebody like me. 

What to do?

Seems I am closed minded and cannot accept a different perspective other than my own, I tend to ask myself questions, to see if there is the possibility of being wrong.

Look at Ethereum, the ETHUSDT weekly chart.
Can you see it bullish?

My hard head is stuck on down/red; a bearish perspective, for many reasons that I've been sharing with you in months past and that I will continue to share... Let's look at it again, can you think of this chart as bullish?

Let's have a look... October 2023; the up-wave.
I see many green candles. I don't see much red; what do you see?

I see maximum two red candles and both are small... Ok, the bullish wave is composed of many green candles and only a few red ones.

Now, March 2024; what do you see? 
I see many red candles, some are pretty big.
I see maximum two green candles with only one big...

I know of the launch of the Ethereum Spot ETF in the USA, followed by selling pressure; what to make of this?

 Conclusion 

‚ûñ When the market is bullish, most of the candles end up closing green on the weekly timeframe.

‚ûñ When the market is bearish, most of the candles end up closing red.

Seeing the change from green to red candles, I am assuming that the market is witnessing a period of uncertainty and doubt, we are no longer in a bullish trend.

Anything can happen at this point, prices can fly high up but, all we can really say is that ETHUSDT was growing strong and the growth stalled.

We can say bearish, as long as lower highs are still in place.
‚ûñ If Ethereum moves to hit a new high vs late May, we can consider higher prices because the chart structure changed.

‚ûñ As long as the May high holds as resistance, we continue aiming lower.
The EMAs on the chart are the immediate and critical support.

The fact that we will now have an "eternal bull-market" on the stock market, can mean that Cryptocurrency is about to enter correction mode.

There is a situation that has been decided by the FED, I will share this on the SPX trade idea... Boost this one and follow because this is important for all your trades; your finances as a whole.

Namaste.

Hello guys,

ETH ETF trading officially started on 23rd July and I would like to discuss what we can expect from Ethereum price in short and mid terms.

If story repeats itself then we can expect price drop on ETH in short term as it was with Bitcoin after start of BTC ETF trading. I remind that Bitcoin price dropped on 20% after the start of BTC ETF trading. Same thing can happen with Ethereum price in coming days and weeks. 
Also, as it was with Bitcoin after beginning of ETF trading, there is huge outflow from Grayscale  which puts a lot of pressure on the price. This can last for a few weeks and after that we can expect reduction of selling pressure and new wave of the uptrend.

Another story here is that even after beginning of ETF trading Ethereum price still follows Bitcoin price and at the moment there is selling pressure on BTC as Mt.Gox exchange transferring another big part of what they should repay. 

In conclusion, we have to wait when outflow from Grayscale reduces and when Mt.Gox will transfer most of their funds for repayment. These two events will reduce selling pressure for both assets and will help to resume the uptrend.

Please, do not forget to boost this idea and leave your comments below, thanks.

I have an idea for ETH & BTC.

Simple look back to 2020-02-24. ETH down 70% before jumping.

Same with BTC, it divided 2.5 times from local top 10K to 3K8 (around 63%)

From CoinGlass check the liquidation heat map for ETH and BTC. 
With current situation, if BTC and ETH price turn down 63% for BTC and 70% for ETH then bottom price will be around 25K for BTC, and 1300 for ETH.

And go up crazy after that.
___
We have a scenario for Ethereum.

Note that this analysis requires a lot of time

It doesn't matter if we reach the green range like the wave counter on the chart or not, but whenever the price reaches the green range, we will be a buyer.

Ethereum seems to be completing a large bullish triangle, which we are now in wave d.

It is expected to be rejected from the supply range to the damnd range.

On the green range, we are looking for buy/long positions for medium and long term.

Closing a daily candle above the invalidation level will violate this analysis.

For risk management, please don't forget stop loss and capital management
Comment if you have any questions
Thank You

Looking at the volatility in the market in recent times and the unpredictability of the market, I am wondering if we should be targeting the $2700 area for ETHUSD.

As of the latest 4-hour chart analysis,  BINANCE:ETHUSDT  is exhibiting bearish signals across multiple technical indicators, suggesting potential downward pressure in the near term. The most recent closing prices have been declining, with ETH closing at $2,339.96 after previously closing at $2,312.72, $2,688.92, $2,757.55, and $2,826.98. This downward trajectory indicates that the selling pressure is mounting.

The 9 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and 20 EMA are both trending downwards, with the 9 EMA currently at 2660.85 and the 20 EMA at $2,839.74. This indicates a strong bearish sentiment, as shorter-term momentum (9 EMA) is below the longer-term trend (20 EMA). Typically, such a crossover suggests that the market may continue to experience bearish momentum.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) values are firmly in negative territory, with the MACD line below the signal line. The most recent MACD value is -175.27 with a signal line at -118.55, producing a histogram of -56.72. The widening of the MACD and signal line indicates increasing bearish momentum, with the histogram further confirming the strength of the downward trend.
  
RSI (Relative Strength Index) values are deeply oversold, with the latest reading at 12.57. Values below 30 typically indicate oversold conditions, suggesting that the asset might be undervalued and due for a potential reversal. However, the RSI being this low also underscores the current bearish pressure.

The Ethereum price is approaching key resistance levels at $3,032.55, $3,066.83, and $3,083.47. Should the price attempt a recovery, these levels will be crucial to monitor. Breaking above these levels would be necessary for any potential bullish reversal, yet the current indicators suggest this is unlikely in the immediate term.

 Potential Trading Strategies
 
Considering the current bearish trend, caution is advised for entering long positions. Potential entry points could be considered if there is a clear reversal signal near oversold conditions on the RSI, combined with a bullish crossover on the MACD. An exit point could be placed just below the resistance levels, specifically around 3032.55 to manage risk effectively.

The prevailing trend favors short positions. Potential entry points could be at or near the resistance levels mentioned ($3,032.55, $3,066.83, $3,083.47), anticipating that the Ethereum price will fail to break through these levels. Exiting these trades could be considered as the Ethereum price approaches key support levels or if a bullish reversal signal is confirmed.

Ethereum has had a massive collapse today as Jump crypto faces some sort of issues. This has lead to over a 20% decline in a single day, but has also lead us to the most important level of price action for ETH to hold (especially with candle bodies on HTF). This zone ranges between $2,000-$2,150 with about $2,100 being the key level of interest. 

Here are some previous posts where Viaquant has outlined the importance of this level:

Hello everyone, let's take a look at the ETH to USDT chart on a 12-hour time frame. How can we see how the downtrend channel has been defined for us, in which we are at the lower border.

Let's start by determining the support line and here you can see how the support at $2,823 has been broken and we are currently approaching the strong support at $2,626, while when we start going further, the next support is around $2,392.

Looking the other way, there is resistance at $2,922, and then the price will again have to face the resistance zone from $3,098 to $3,225.

We're currently broken below the sellside (red line) we noted earlier. 

Taken a long position looking to target the HTF buyside sitting around 3.9K.

A clean break and hold below 2.5K and the trade idea is invalidated.

No need to front run the market...simply FOLLOW THE MARKET AND TRADE WITH IT. 

Let's see where the market wants to go from here.

So, as I mentioned in my previos analyis on ETH I said that I won't rule out another stop hunt below ~2800$ for ETH and this is the reason why I believe so: If you are a bear, this is probably what you are looking at: A huge IHS with the neckline around ~2825$ which would give a target of 2k. But knowing the market for almost 10 years now I think I know what happens next :)

These huge and OBVIOUS shoulder-head-shoulder patterns fail almost every time, or at least >90% of the time. So pretty sure we are about to see a nice bear-trap coming days which means a stop hunt below 2800 to ~2700-2750$ hold there for 1-2 days and then see an aggressive push above the "neckline" again. 

Do what you will with this information :) I start longing from the range lows with bids down to 2700$

Stay safe!

Disclaimer: This is not a financial advice, just for informational purposes

Support Level: ETHUSDT has held this support of $2860.34 and $2708.70 since 17th February till date, acting as a solid point for a potential Upward movement.

Target: My target for this analysis is $3235.14. The reason is that this region is a potential resistance level for the market, but we will be looking out for a bullish/change in the current structure
___
ETH seems to be a bit more tricky at this point... Now with the possible tailwind of the ETF, which in my opinion is not priced in yet, ETH should perform well eventually. But similar to what we have seen after the approval and listing of the BTC ETF, it seems to lack conviction. 

When looking at the chart I see a possible danger right ahead: Equal lows. These usually get run for a nasty stop hunt, so this is what I would wait for before entering the market again. But again, just a WILD guess, anything could happen at this point. 

To the upside 3.6k should be THE resistance to break for continuation, ETH should then pick up momentum and target the 5k level. 

Stay safe!
___
ETH can go lower as long as it stays below 3250
 
ETH broke a strong structure zone. 

3250 seems to be closely monitored by market participants and is adding more value that it can be an important area for any price direction.

Price tested this area several times these days and if it stays below, chances will increase that ETH could test 3050 and 2900

 You may find more details in the chart!
Thank you and Good Luck!

The range of 2840 is an important support for Ethereum, with the failure of this support, it can fall to 2729 and in case of strength to the range of 2645. Otherwise, and price rejection from the support zone, we can expect the price to rise up to the resistance range of 3025 and then the range of 3200.

Ethereum has initiated a 146% bullish wave on the monthly timeframe but is currently undergoing a rest and correction phase.

üîç Fibonacci Retracement Levels from 1516 to 4114:

0.38 Fib Level: 2864
0.5 Fib Level: 2548
0.618 Fib Level: 2268
üîó Weekly Timeframe Insights:

A 624-day long ascending channel is observed.
The price is currently interacting with the midline of this ascending channel.
The channel's bottom serves as a strong support zone around 2232 to 2505, which aligns with our PRZ (Potential Reversal Zone).
üõ°Ô∏è Key Points:

This PRZ lies between the 0.5 to 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels.
The 200 MA (Moving Average) on the monthly timeframe also converges in this area.
The psychological level of $2500 is significant, with nearly $2 billion in long positions that could be liquidated around this zone.
The horizontal channel target on the daily timeframe is also situated here.
üìâ Daily Timeframe Observations:

Currently, Ethereum is in a horizontal channel on the daily timeframe.
The channel's bottom coincides with the weekly support at 2865. A break below this level might present a shorting opportunity.
üí° Strategic Suggestions:

For long-term holds and buying, it‚Äôs advisable to wait until Ethereum reaches the PRZ and exhibits a bullish reaction and momentum.
Alternatively, consider entering after a break above the daily channel.
For DeFi or lending and borrowing, $2500 could be an interesting entry point, provided your liquidation level is below $1500.

Ethereum (ETH/USDT) Analysis

üí∞ Welcome to Your Channel!
Welcome to our channel where we delve into the intricacies of financial markets. Today, we focus on ETH/USDT, dissecting its current price action to uncover strategic trading opportunities. Join us as we analyze key levels and market dynamics, aiming to refine our trading strategies and maximize potential gains.

üí° Previous Analysis Review:
We expected the price to have a retracement higher before expanding lower, similar to Bitcoin. However, Ethereum showed more bearishness and expanded lower without the expected retracement.

üìç Current Market Overview:
The current price is around 2,916.80. ETH has swept the previous week low (PWL) and taken out some sell-side liquidity (SSL). It has also tapped into a Fair Value Gap (FVG) on the 4-hour timeframe.

üîç Identifying Key Levels:

‚Ä¢ PMH: Previous Month High
‚Ä¢ PWL: Previous Week Low
‚Ä¢ PWH: Previous Week High
‚Ä¢ PML: Previous Month Low
‚Ä¢ BSL: Buy-Side Liquidity
‚Ä¢ SSL: Sell-Side Liquidity
‚Ä¢ 4H FVG: 4-Hour Fair Value Gap, highlighting areas of imbalance on the 4-hour timeframe

üìä Key Considerations:

‚Ä¢ Swept Previous Week Low: ETH has swept the previous week low (PWL) and taken out low resistance sell-side liquidity on lower time frames.
‚Ä¢ Support Levels: The price has tapped into a 4-Hour FVG and has shown a reaction, indicating potential support.
‚Ä¢ SMT at the Lows: There is SMT (Smart Money Technique) at the lows with BTC, which is a bullish indication. BTC formed higher lows while ETH formed lower lows.
‚Ä¢ Reaction to FVGs: We need to observe the reaction from the two FVGs close to the current price for further confirmation of the next move.
‚Ä¢ Inverse Confluence: If we inverse the chart, it provides another confluence to the bullish scenario.

üìà Bullish Scenario:
Given the current price action and key considerations, a bullish scenario is possible if the following conditions are met:

‚Ä¢ Retracement Higher: We can expect the price to have a retracement higher from the current support levels. This move could target some key resistance levels or lower time frame low resistance levels, similar to the analysis we performed for BTC/USDT.
‚Ä¢ Key Levels to Target: The price could aim for the 4-Hour FVG above and possibly sweep minor buy-side liquidity before deciding on the next move.

üìâ Bearish Scenario:
A bearish scenario should be considered if the following conditions are met:

‚Ä¢ Failure to Hold Support: If the price fails to hold the current support levels provided by the 4-Hour FVG, we might see a continuation lower.
‚Ä¢ Clearing Buy-Side Liquidity: For any bearish scenario, we need to see some buy-side liquidity being taken out first before considering lower targets.

üìä Chart Analysis Summary:
‚Ä¢ Bullish Expectation: The expectation is for the price to potentially retrace higher from the current levels, targeting the 4-Hour FVG above or some lower time frame low resistance levels. The SMT at the lows with BTC adds to this bullish outlook.
‚Ä¢ Bearish Expectation: For a bearish scenario, we need to see a failure to hold the current support levels and potentially clear some buy-side liquidity before considering lower targets.

üí° Conclusion:
The ETH/USDT chart is showing a similar pattern to the BTC/USDT chart analyzed previously. We can expect a potential retracement higher from the current support levels, with key levels to watch for further moves. The SMT at the lows with BTC provides a bullish indication. As always, keeping an eye on how the price interacts with these levels will be crucial in determining the next steps.

üôè Thank you for joining us!

Summary of the Current Situation:
ETH/USDT is currently trading around 2914.68 USDT after experiencing a sharp decline, but it seems to show signs of recovery. Here are some key points to note:

	 1.     Overall Trend: 
	‚Ä¢	A sharp decline has been observed recently, but indicators show signs of stabilization and potentially a recovery.
	 2.	Technical Indicators: 
	‚Ä¢	Volume & CVD/Ratio: Analysis of volumes and the CVD/OI (Open Interest) ratio indicates good volume distribution (BG Vent) and a stable trend (Ratio CVD/OI OK).
	‚Ä¢	ISPD DIV Pro (Oxsakil): The blue zone shows a slight positive divergence (zone OK), which could indicate an imminent reversal.
	‚Ä¢	BB/RSI DIV: The RSI is in an oversold zone, but a bullish divergence seems to be forming, which is a good sign for a potential reversal (BG Vent OK).
	‚Ä¢	TSI (True Strength Index): The TSI shows an attempt to cross upwards, which could confirm a bullish reversal if the crossover materializes.
	 3.	Moving Averages: 
	‚Ä¢	Moving averages (SMA 20, EMA 50, etc.) show a short-term bearish trend, but a recovery above these levels could confirm a bullish reversal.

 Possible Scenario :

	‚Ä¢	If the current support zone around 2900-3000 USDT holds, a recovery towards the 3100-3200 USDT levels is possible in the short term.
	‚Ä¢	A break below the key support could lead to a continuation of the bearish trend towards the 2800 USDT levels.

 Trading Strategy: 

	‚Ä¢	Buyers: Look to enter long positions near the key support with tight stop-losses below 2900 USDT.
	‚Ä¢	Sellers: Short positions can be considered if the 2900 USDT support is broken, with targets around 2800 USDT.

 Conclusion :
ETH/USDT shows signs of stabilization after a sharp decline. Technical indicators suggest a potential recovery, but confirmation is needed. Keep a close watch on key support and resistance levels for trading opportunities. Technical Analysis ETH/USDT - 8H Period.

Recent political developments have influenced the crypto market significantly. The rise in Trump‚Äôs chances initially propelled the crypto market upwards. However, with Biden dropping out of the presidential race and the introduction of his alternate candidate, Trump‚Äôs chances are now perceived to be decreasing, which could lead to a correction in the crypto market.

From a technical perspective,  COINBASE:ETHUSD   has faced strong resistance at a key zone in the 4-hour time frame. Despite multiple attempts,  BINANCE:ETHUSDT   was unable to break through this crucial resistance level, suggesting a lack of bullish momentum to sustain higher prices. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a bearish divergence, indicating weakening buying pressure and potential for a downward move.

Given the inability to breach the resistance, the bearish RSI divergence, and the prevailing political uncertainties, it is likely that ETH will experience a pullback. This correction could provide a consolidation phase before the market assesses the next potential moves. Traders should be cautious and consider the potential for a short-term decline in ETH prices.

Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern printing on the sell the news event on Ethereum ETF as it starts to trade.

Validation of the Inverse H&S is on breakout of the neckline at $3451 (+/- 30$) on high volume and preferable later a retest of the neckline as support

The invalidation of the Inverse H&S is a candle close below $2930. We might go there as Grayscale probably will bleed a lot from their high fee ETH trust.

Target: At $4069 that coincides with highest price of the year

This analysis focuses on Ethereum (ETH/USD) on the daily timeframe, highlighting key support levels, buying opportunities, and potential rebound scenarios.
 Analysis:
 Key Support Levels: 
ETH is back to key support at $2880.
The green box between $2880 and $2720 represents a good buying opportunity.
Major support is around $2500.
Directional Movement Index (DMI):
The DMI shows D- still controlling the market.
However, a bounce back from current levels is possible soon.
 Potential Rebound: 
If ETH holds the $2880 support, it could rise back to $3280.
The $3280 level aligns with the mid-Bollinger Band, serving as a key resistance.
 Conclusion:  ETH is at a critical juncture with key support at $2880 offering a buying opportunity. If the support holds, a rebound to $3280 is possible, despite D- currently controlling the market. Monitor these levels closely for potential bullish moves.
___
So in my previous analysis on ETH I said that I won't rule out another drop to 2700-2800$ coming days BUT there is also a chance, that this small double-bottom pattern is going to play out, which would most likely invalidate my idea of seeing a huge bear trap.

As I have shown ETH needs to break the resistance at 3280$ and hold there for 2-3 days before pushing through the neckline at 3400$. It could happen, but given it's almost weekend the markets usually lack volume and momentum, so not sure about it. 

Just want to give you an idea how markets behave and what needs to happen, but I surely won't be trading this. However, if we take out 3.4k next week this would most likely trigger a push towards ~3700. 

If it stays below the resistance zone coming days it will likely fail and the support around 3083 will give in eventually. 

Stays safe!
___
Upon analyzing the ETH/USDT daily chart, it's clear that Ethereum has experienced a mix of bullish and bearish phases, with key resistance and support levels playing a pivotal role in its price movements. Let‚Äôs break down the crucial elements:

Support and Resistance Levels:

Support Level 1 (S1) is set at $2,780.64. This level has previously served as a turning point for price corrections and may provide a floor should the price drop further.
Support Level 2 (S2) at $2,126.90, which marks a critical area if a more significant sell-off occurs.
Resistance Level 1 (R1) at $4,105.80, representing a ceiling from previous price peaks that Ethereum might test if a bullish trend resumes.
Technical Indicators:

The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is well below the zero line and shows a substantial bearish divergence. This indicates strong selling pressure and could suggest further downward movements unless there's a positive crossover soon.
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is nearing the oversold territory but has not yet entered it, signaling that while selling pressure is high, there might be some potential for stabilization or a corrective rally if the market perceives ETH as undervalued.
Conclusion:
The current market position for ETH/USDT suggests a cautious approach. The negative MACD and approaching oversold RSI indicate a bearish trend, but these also bring potential for reversal scenarios, particularly near strong support levels like S1 and S2. Traders should watch for any signs of bullish reversals or stabilization at these supports, which could offer buying opportunities. Conversely, a break below S2 could lead to accelerated declines, and thus risk management strategies should be prioritized. The market's reaction at these key junctures will be critical in determining Ethereum's path in the coming weeks. As always, it's essential to stay updated with broader market trends and news that could influence Ethereum's price.
___
Here is a quick look into what I am looking for on ETH. 

The market continues on breaching lower towards the sellside. 

Let's see how we react from the daily sellside liquidity (red line). I've noted the FVG (yellow box) on the left side of the chart. Feel free to note it on your own charts and extend it to get a better overview ....

IF we fail to hold the current daily sellside liquidity (red line) we should expect the market to continue on reaching lower towards 2.5K. 
IF we fail to break below the current daily sellside liquidity (red line) and reclaim it expect the market to aggressively run towards the buyside liquidity around 3.4K-3.5K. 

BE PATIENT...PLAN...EXECUTE 

Stay safe and never risk more than 1-5% of your capital per trade. The following analysis is merely a price action based analysis and does not constitute financial advice in any form.

#ETH/USDT #Analysis
Description 
---------------------------------------------------------------
+ Ethereum (ETH) has been consolidating in an accumulation zone between $2,900 and $3,500 after a significant rally. This zone is crucial as it represents a battle between bulls and bears, with accumulation possibly leading to a strong upward breakout.
+ The chart shows strong support at the $2,900 level, which aligns with the 21-Week EMA ($3,219). This area has been tested multiple times, reinforcing its importance as a potential launching point for the next move higher.
+ The price is currently sitting just below the 21 EMA, while the 55 EMA ($2,792) provides additional support below. The confluence of these EMAs suggests that the trend is still bullish, but a clear breakout above the accumulation zone is needed for confirmation.
+ The RSI is hovering around the neutral 50 level, indicating a lack of clear momentum, but it‚Äôs still holding above key levels that could indicate strength if it turns upward. The MACD is slightly bearish but not showing strong negative momentum, suggesting the potential for a reversal if buying pressure increases.
+ A breakout above the $3,500 resistance could trigger a strong rally, with the next major resistance levels around $5,000 and $8,000. This breakout would likely be confirmed by a bullish crossover in the MACD and an RSI move above 60.
+ If ETH breaks below the $2,900 support level, we could see a retest of the 55 EMA at $2,792 or even a deeper correction to the trendline support near $2,500. A bearish MACD crossover and a drop in RSI below 40 would confirm this scenario.

 Key Levels to Watch: 
Support: $2,900, 21 EMA ($3,219), 55 EMA ($2,792)
Resistance: $3,500, $5,000, $8,000

Hey everyone!

Appreciate a like and follow if you find this analysis helpful!

Let's dive into the ETH 2-day timeframe chart. We're currently observing a bullish flag pattern forming. The price is nearing the lower support line of this flag, a level that has held strong for the past six months. Historically, ETH has bounced positively from this zone.

It's worth noting that the ETH ETF was recently launched, mirroring the BTC ETF launch in January. Following the BTC ETF launch, BTC experienced a roughly 20% drop before embarking on a parabolic 90% surge. A similar pattern could unfold for ETH.

This setup presents a compelling risk-reward opportunity for ETH buying.

Entry range: $2750-$2900
Targets: $3800, $5700, $7300, $10,000
Stop-loss: 2-day close below $2500

Taken a nice scalp short on ETH...

Entry 2970
TP 2915 
SL 3007

We took out the buyside liquidity from 8:30 am (NY TIME) and the 1H inverted FVG (blue box) confirmed the market would want to reach for the HTF sellside. You'll note I entered on a 5min imbalance (red line) and note directly on in the inverted FVG.... we don't always have to play the market aggressively... 

We pushed up in the 'pre-market' (crypto never sleeps so you'll understand that 'pre-market' simply refers to before 9:30 am - NY TIME in this context...) 

Overall overview of the market remains the same. Market is not necessarily looking great (yet) for some nice obvious swings so don't hesitate to RELY ON YOUR SYSTEM AND FUNDAMENTALS AND PICKING YOUR TRADES...

For the regulars ...no I did not forget the weekly end of the week message to you all .... I hope you guys and girl have another amazing week and that your trading week was also fruitful. As always YOUR TRADING JOURNEY IS UNIQUE TO YOU ....LEARN FROM IT AND GROW THROUGH IT...

By analyzing the #Ethereum chart on the weekly (logarithmic) time frame, we observe that after the price reached the Bearish OB zone between $3750 and $4150, it faced selling pressure and corrected down to $2800. Currently, the price is trading around $3000, and we need to see if the support at the $2900 level can hold. In my opinion, Ethereum might correct down to $2500 before starting its next bullish move, driven by increased demand in that area. The important demand levels are $2176 to $2500 and $1367 to $1592. The long-term targets for the price are $4100 and $4880.

ETHUSDT in Symmetrical Triangle: Key Breakout Levels

ETHUSDT on the daily chart is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, characterized by converging trend lines. This pattern indicates potential price consolidation before a breakout. Given the current price action, ETHUSDT is nearing the lower boundary of the triangle, presenting a critical juncture for traders.

Key Levels:

Resistance: $3,600
Support: $2,400
___
I marked out a nice 2 risk reward ratio..seeing if it will retest the previous price before the drop..
___
The downward trend continues, we are gradually descending to the support level. I expect that there is a very large number of stop orders. Ideally, get a sharp impulse down to 2500 and then a decline to 2000
___
Hello everyone, let's take a look at the ETH to USDT chart on the 12h time frame. As you can see, the price broke out of the falling triangle, which resulted in a strong downward price movement.

Let's start by determining the support line, but here you can see how we are first in the support zone, but if we fall lower, the next support is at $2,823 and then we have strong support at $2,626.

Looking the other way, we have visible resistance at $3,146, then strong resistance at $3,263, and then the price must overcome the strong resistance zone from $3,441 to $3,566.

This analysis focuses on Ethereum (ETH/USD) on the daily timeframe, highlighting potential retracement levels, indicators signaling bearish control, and possible bullish scenarios.
 Analysis:
 Potential Retracement:
ETH may retrace to the green box between $2880 and $2730.
This zone represents a key support area where buyers might step in.
Directional Movement Index (DMI):
The DMI indicates bearish control with D- and ADX taking over the 20 range.
This suggests increasing bearish momentum in the short term.
 Key Levels to Watch:
 Support Zone: $2880 - $2730
If ETH holds above $3000, a bounce back to $3100-$3175 is possible.
Resistance Levels: Monitor the reaction if ETH approaches the green box for potential bullish reversal signals.
 Conclusion : ETH is showing signs of a potential retracement to the $2880-$2730 support zone. The DMI signals bearish control, indicating a cautious approach in the near term. However, if ETH holds above $3000, a bounce back to $3100-$3175 is possible. Watch for reactions within the green box to anticipate possible trend reversals.

üìäWhere is the main support for #ETH?‚ùì

üß†To be honest, I am really disappointed with ETH. Compared with BTC, the trend is too weak. However, from a structural perspective, such a decline is very reasonable, because the short structure at the 4-hour level has been established. From this structural perspective, the heaviest support area is 2900-29540. If we reach this area, we can consider spot trading.

‚û°Ô∏èOriginally the short target we got in the blue resistance zone was 2958, but it was closed with the new target after making a new short transaction, so We also missed the profit in today's downward swing, and also received a stop-loss long order, but overall the profit was quite generous.

‚ö†Ô∏è So in the futures trading market, the importance of risk management is reflected. Don‚Äôt let yourself become nothing. ‚ùå

Trend Channels and Correction: There are two distinct descending trend channels visible on the chart. Currently, the price is near the lower boundary of these channels and might make an upward correction. This correction could aim towards the resistance levels marked above.

Fibonacci Levels: The price appears to have touched the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at the 2,914.76 level. A reaction from this level is likely, and the price could move upwards to test the resistance levels.

Support and Resistance Levels: Several important support and resistance levels are drawn on the chart:

Resistance Levels: 3,125.86, 3,232.67, 3,306.00, 3,390.57, and 3,581.27.
Support Level: 2,914.76.
RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI indicator is close to the oversold region. This suggests that the price might soon experience an upward recovery.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD indicator might be signaling a potential upward reversal.

Conclusion:
The Ethereum price could potentially rebound from the lower boundary of the descending channel and initiate an upward movement. The first target for this upward movement could be the 3,125.86 resistance level. If it can break this level, it may test the 3,232.67 and 3,306.00 resistance levels subsequently. However, market conditions and the overall trend should be considered, and risk management is essential.

Were you one of the lucky ones to be merged a few years ago? I was... I didn't invest enough time to look into the merge but did invest enough money. I didn't lose time but I lost money.

‚ûñ The Ethereum Spot ETFs are not a bad thing, this is actually a great development for Ethereum and the Cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. The hype is just hype and is only meant to get you trapped holding a bad hand.

‚ûñ The market moves based on cycles and the cycles develop based on how insiders decide to trade.

‚ûñ With Bitcoin, Crypto, Ethereum, we have the halving which gives further strength to the varied market cycles and we have the elections in the USA that are also repeated every four years.

‚ûñ The Federal Reserve has a different cycle but they announce years in advance what they are going to do.

üëâ Here is how is going to happen: Prices will move down, fast and strong; several weeks straight down and then we will experience long-term, sustained, massive growth.

Easy isn't it?

Thanks a lot for your support.

Namaste.

First of all we need to know that the main structure is bullish and we can trust the signals that are in the same direction as the main trend.

Recently we had a bullish iCH on the chart.

We are in a big range that we are approaching the discount of this range. We are near a support range. 

We will look for buy/long positions within the specified demand range.

The targets are marked on the chart

Closing a daily candle above the invalidation level will violate the analysis

For risk management, please don't forget stop loss and capital management
When we reach the first target, save some profit and then change the stop to entry

Despite the overall bullish trend observed in the daily timeframes,  BINANCE:ETHUSDT  continues to move sideways within the range of 2850 to 4000. On the weekly timeframe, we are witnessing a tweezer top setup, which indicates a potential pullback. I anticipate that the market to move toward the bottom of the consolidation zone, forming a two-legged pullback. Each time the price nears the psychological level of 3000, it has consistently taken liquidity below that level before moving upward. Given this setup, I expect the price to retest the round number and then bounce off. My target is the resistance zone at 3350.00

Slight amendment to this idea > 

I believe Ethereum has completed or is in the process of completing wave 2 and a new impulse wave 3 will start soon towards $4000+

Price must stay above $2810 or this idea will be invalid (wave 2 crossing start of wave 1)

Also, a series of calculations that are related to my personalized indicator show a bearish HiddenDivergence in the MACD and a weakening of the one-hour MACD. 
Therefore, TP 1 to 4 are available and by hitting each of them until we see a divergence, we can take profit up to TP 4.

Trading can be exciting and profitable, but it's important to spot habits that might hurt your success. Here are key warning signs to help you become a more disciplined and successful trader:
 
 Constantly Checking Charts : If you find yourself compulsively opening your charts every hour and feeling physical discomfort if you don't, it's time to reassess your approach. Constant monitoring can lead to impulsive decisions and increased stress.

 Impulse Trading on Minor Changes : Do you get the urge to jump into a trade at the slightest percentage change of a currency? This habit can be detrimental. Reacting to every minor fluctuation often results in overtrading and can erode your capital.

 Trading Without Stop Losses : Having open trades without setting stop losses is a recipe for disaster. Stop losses are crucial in managing risk and preventing significant losses.

 Checking Apps Before Starting Your Day : If your first action in the morning is to check your trading app or charts before even washing your face, it's a sign that trading is consuming your life. This habit can lead to burnout and poor decision-making.

 Not Keeping a Trading Journal : Failing to document your trades and thoughts can hinder your progress. A trading journal helps you learn from past mistakes and successes, allowing for continuous improvement.
 


 Tips for Better Trading: 

These warning signs highlight areas for improvement. By addressing these habits, you can enhance your trading strategy and outcomes. Here are some tips that have helped me become a better trader:

 
 Set Specific Times to Check Charts: Limit chart checking to specific times of the day. This helps reduce stress and impulsive decisions.
 Develop a Clear Trading Plan: Outline your trading strategy, including entry and exit points. Stick to your plan to avoid knee-jerk reactions to market movements.
 Use Stop Losses: Always set stop losses to manage risk effectively. This practice can save you from significant losses and emotional distress.
 Establish a Morning Routine: Start your day with a routine that doesn‚Äôt involve trading. This helps create a balanced life and a clear mind for trading decisions.
 Maintain a Trading Journal: Documenting your trades, strategies, and outcomes helps you learn from your experiences and refine your trading methods.
 

By recognizing these warning signs and implementing these tips, you can cultivate a more disciplined and successful trading practice. Happy trading!

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

ETH has been overall bullish trading within the rising channel in red.

üìàAs long as the last low in red holds, a continuation towards the $2500 would be expected.

In parallel, if the red low is broken downward, a bearish correction towards the $3000 round number would be expected.

Which scenario do you think is more likely to happen first? and why?

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

BINANCE:ETHUSD  in the correction phase, testing zones of interest (0.5 fibo and MA-200), forming a false breakdown, which in general can lead to a strong upward movement supported by strong fundamentals.



Fundamentally, ETH is quite positive. ETH-ETFs were launched on July 23 and continue to gain momentum. The correction, which has been observed for the last two days is mainly due to the outflow from GrayScale (exactly the same scenario was with BTC), also a slight pressure is created by the situation with Mt.Gox, but against the background of BTC transfers to exchanges and their distribution among its debtors, bitcoin is strengthening, such behavior of the flagship indicates support for eth.
Technically, the price is forming a correction to 0.5 fibo relative to the bullish momentum as well as a retest of the Daily MA-200, forming a false breakdown with a fairly aggressive buyback, indicating the presence of a strong buyer who is not ready to go down beyond $3000.

 Resistance levels: 3357, 3540
Support levels: 3200, MA-200 

The main task of the bulls is to keep the defense above the zone of interest at $3200. Further it remains to wait for resistance retest with the purpose of its breakthrough and further bull run to $4000 - $4500 - $4900.
 
Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:ETHUSD

The price on D1 may begin to form a 3-wave structure, which may indicate the beginning of growth, globally to the ATH update levels, if we consider the level from which the price rebounded, we can reach 3860. If we consider H4, we can see the formation of the 5th wave in continuation of the upward movement .To cancel, it is better to consider fixing behind the trend line, since the correction may continue through the ABC structure on D1.

In a landmark event for the cryptocurrency market, the launch of the spot Ethereum ETF in the United States has brought in a staggering $2.2 billion in inflows, as reported by  CoinShares . This surge marks the highest weekly inflow since December 2020, highlighting a renewed interest and confidence in Ethereum and the broader crypto ecosystem.

Unpacking the Inflows and Outflows
CoinShares, a leading blockchain analytics firm, revealed in its latest report that the launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs last week significantly boosted market activity. Weekly trading volumes skyrocketed to $14.8 billion, indicating robust investor engagement. However, the picture is not entirely rosy. The Grayscale Ethereum ETF (ETHE), despite the overall positive market sentiment, experienced substantial outflows amounting to $1.5 billion, nearly 20% of its assets under management. This outflow dampened the otherwise bullish narrative.

In contrast, ETFs managed by giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise saw net inflows totaling $1.18 billion in the same period. Despite these positive inflows, the net outflow for Ethereum ETFs in the first week stood at $338 million. Globally, Ether ETP products experienced a massive 542% surge in trading volumes, reflecting a high degree of investor activity and interest.

A D√©j√† Vu with Bitcoin ETFs
The initial response to Ethereum ETFs mirrors the early days of Bitcoin ETFs. Last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded inflows of $519 million, contributing to a monthly total of $3.6 billion and a year-to-date inflow of $19 billion. These figures underline a growing acceptance and adoption of crypto ETFs among institutional and retail investors alike.

Despite mixed flows, digital asset investment products saw relatively muted inflows of $245 million last week. Nonetheless, the Ethereum ETF launch significantly boosted trading volumes, reaching their highest levels since May at $14.8 billion.

Ethereum Price Dynamics
Ethereum's price has been on an upward trajectory, gaining over 1.64% in Monday's trading. Data from CryptoQuant indicates a surge in open interest, with a $1.5 billion increase in the last three weeks. This rise in leveraged trading could lead to greater volatility, as liquidations become inevitable. Investors should brace for potential price swings in the near term.

Looking Ahead
The recent price appreciation has pushed total assets under management (AuM) to $99.1 billion, with year-to-date inflows reaching a record-breaking $20.5 billion. As the market continues to evolve, the launch of the Ethereum ETF marks a significant milestone, paving the way for increased mainstream adoption of digital assets.

While the mixed response to different Ethereum ETFs may cause short-term fluctuations, the overall trend points towards a growing maturity and acceptance of cryptocurrency investments. As an Investor and market participant closely watch how these dynamics play out, particularly with the anticipated increased volatility in Ethereum's price.

In summary, the launch of the spot Ethereum ETF has had a profound impact on the market, bringing in unprecedented inflows and driving trading volumes to new highs. As the ecosystem continues to grow and mature, the future of Ethereum ( CRYPTOCAP:ETH ) and its investment products looks promising, albeit with the expected market volatility.

In the daily time frame, Ethereum faces significant resistances. If the price reaches the $3300 and $3500 resistance levels, sellers might become more active, causing a pullback. This pullback allows the price to return to support levels, gathering the necessary liquidity for the next upward move. The $3100 and $2900 support levels are critical points where the price is likely to rebound, playing a key role in determining Ethereum‚Äôs future trend.

Analyzing the ETH/USDT daily chart provides a comprehensive view of Ethereum's current market behavior and potential future movements based on the displayed technical indicators and patterns.

Current Market Position:
As of now, ETH/USDT is trading at around $3,267.79, showing a minor decline of 0.2% on the day. This follows a period of volatility where Ethereum tested various support and resistance levels.

Key Technical Indicators:
Support Levels (S1 and S2):

S1 ($2,837.73): This level has been tested several times in recent months and has provided a solid base for Ethereum. It currently serves as a crucial marker for the bearish threshold.
S2 ($2,112.62): This support level is significantly lower and has not been approached recently but remains an important psychological and technical support in case of a substantial market downturn.
Resistance Levels (R1 and R2):

R1 ($4,134.34): This resistance level has capped upward movements in the past and remains a key target for bullish momentum to overcome.
R2: This is extrapolated to be much higher and would likely come into play should Ethereum gain strong market enthusiasm, breaking past the previous highs.
Technical Indicators:
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):
The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating bearish momentum. The histogram, currently at zero, suggests a lack of strong momentum in either direction, pointing to potential consolidation.

RSI (Relative Strength Index):
The RSI is at 54.86, indicating a neutral position. This suggests that while the market isn't in overbought or oversold territory, it's balanced with a slight tilt towards bullish sentiment given it's above the 50 midpoint.

Chart Patterns:
The price movement of Ethereum within this timeframe shows a trading range forming, with the potential setup of a rectangle pattern between S1 and R1. This indicates that Ethereum is consolidating within these levels and could be preparing for a significant move once it breaks out of this range.
Conclusion:
The ETH/USDT pair shows signs of consolidation with a potential for breakout or breakdown depending on broader market sentiments and upcoming Ethereum network developments. The immediate focus should be on maintaining support at $2,837.73. A break below this level could signal a deeper retracement towards $2,112.62. Conversely, moving past $4,134.34 in a convincing fashion could initiate a new bullish phase aiming for higher resistances.

For traders, maintaining a close watch on these levels and adjusting stop-losses and take-profits accordingly would be prudent. Being vigilant about any news related to Ethereum that might impact market sentiment is also recommended, as crypto markets are particularly sensitive to news flows and regulatory developments.

The well anticipated launch of the Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs in the U.S. has not yet led to a significant price increase for ETH, and in fact the price has declined since the ETFs were approved and launched.

What‚Äôs happening with Ethereum? - A Technical Analysis

Before discussing about the major factors that triggered the bearish downturn, it is important to analyse the technical aspects and price action of Ethereum.

After reaching a 2024 all-time high (ATH) of $4093.92, ETH experienced a bearish divergence. This was followed by the formation of a falling wedge pattern, which broke out following news of a potential ETH ETF approval.

Despite attempting to retest the aforementioned ATH, ETH fell, forming a parallel regression channel. It briefly broke below the 200-day EMA support level, raising concerns. However, ETH quickly recovered and is currently retesting the 200-day EMA support, showing signs of a bounce back. If this support level fails, ETH may revisit its major demand zone between $2844 and $2923.

Traditional indicators show mixed signals. The MACD is turning bearish, while the RSI remains neutral. The near-term trend will likely depend on market sentiment related to the potential ETH ETF inflow/outflow. If ETH holds the support levels, a bullish divergence could be on the horizon

Now let us examine the major events that triggered the correction of Ethereum:

 Sell-the-News Event 
The approval and launch of the ETFs may have triggered a classic "sell-the-news" event, where investors sell their ETH holdings to lock in profits after the long-anticipated approval. With the ETH reaching $3,500 in July, some investors likely wanted to capitalize on the euphoria around the ETF launch by selling. We saw a huge momentum candle before the ETH ETF news came out. The lowered impact on the prices

 Outflows from Grayscale Ethereum Trust 
The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) experienced large outflows of $484 million on the first day of ETF trading, as investors redeemed their ETHE shares. This selling pressure may have offset the buying demand from the new ETFs.

 Liquidation of Long Positions 
Over $94 million in long ETH positions were liquidated in the 24 hours after the ETFs launched, indicating traders who were betting on an ETH price increase got squeezed out. This likely exacerbated the selling pressure.

 Broader Market Downturn 
The decline in ETH price coincided with a broader downturn in the crypto and US- European stock markets, with Bitcoin dropping 2.5% and the Nasdaq having its worst day since late 2022. This suggests macroeconomic factors were also weighing on ETH.

 Delayed Inflows 
While the ETFs attracted $107 million in net inflows on launch day, this was only 16% of the $655 million Bitcoin ETFs attracted on their first day. The full impact of ETF inflows may take more time to materialize.

 Stagnant Fundamentals 
Some analysts argue Ethereum's fundamentals have been stagnant or declining, making it more vulnerable to selling pressure compared to Bitcoin The ongoing Mt. Gox repayments and distributions may also be weighing on the market.

In summary, the combination of a "sell-the-news" event, outflows from ETHE, liquidations, macroeconomic factors, and delayed inflows likely all contributed to the decline in ETH price despite the successful ETF launches. However, analysts remain optimistic that ETH will resume its upward trend in the coming weeks.
___

Price has return back to the channel, and now sitting between two local key levels. There be an accumulation for a while, and after the break of one of the levels, it will be more easier to understand the direction.

Yello, Paradisers! Have you noticed how bullish #ETHUSDT has been since testing the range lows? Let's dive into the details!

üíé#Ethereum is currently forming a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, indicating a significant bullish reversal. However, it stands at a crucial juncture, facing both the neckline resistance and the descending resistance at the $3505 level.

üíéThis is a major hurdle for the bulls. A strong breakout above 3505 level, supported by high volumes, could quickly propel Ethereum towards $3650 and $3720. These levels are the minor resistances and may cause some profit-taking, but if the bullish momentum persists, Ethereum would aim for the strong resistance at $3980 level in the coming sessions.

üíéDecent support at 3300 to 3250 level. This range offers both horizontal and key dynamic support. Holding this level will be crucial for the bulls, as it provides a solid foundation for further upward movement.

üíéEthereum is at a pivotal moment. If it breaks through the $3505 resistance with strong volume, we could see a significant rally. On the other hand, maintaining support at $3300-$3250 is essential for sustaining the bullish outlook.

Stay sharp and trade smart, Paradisers! Consistency and strategy will guide you to long-term success in the crypto market.

As per our previous analysis, ETH rejected the $3000 support zone and traded higher.

üìà ETH is still trading within a big range in the shape of a symmetrical triangle.

üèπ Thus, as it approaches the $3000 again, we expect a bullish movement towards the $3,500 round number.

üìä#ETH rebounded as expected, where is the target?‚ùì

üß† From a structural perspective, there is only a bullish expectation after the short target is fully realized, so a rebound in the buy zone is very reasonable. At present, the price has reached a staged resistance zone, and there is a risk of falling back. Since our entry point was not very good and we did not want to bear the possibility of a profit retracement, we closed our long orders.

‚û°Ô∏èIf there is a good correction, then we will consider buying again, because the expected target of this rebound (3360) has not yet been achieved, so it is still worth looking forward toüôè

The chart shows ETH/USDT within a descending channel, highlighted by the purple lines.
There is a crucial support area between $2,800 and $3,000, represented by the orange and yellow shaded areas, indicating potential areas for buying.

ETH/USDT has recently bounced off the lower boundary of the descending channel, indicating that this support level still holds.
The upper boundary of the descending channel, along with the horizontal resistance around $3,600, forms a key resistance area that ETH needs to break to confirm a bullish reversal.

The green line (possibly a moving average) around $3,050 currently acts as a dynamic support level.
Recent price action indicates a double-bottom pattern around the $2,900-$3,000 range, suggesting a potential bullish reversal if confirmed.

If ETH/USDT can sustain above the $3,000 support, the next target will be the upper boundary of the descending channel and the horizontal resistance at $3,600.
A break below the $2,800-$3,000 support zone could lead to further declines towards the next significant support levels around $2,300-$2,500.

This analysis is based on a visual interpretation of the chart.
Consider using additional technical indicators and keeping an eye on market news and sentiment for a more detailed and accurate analysis.

Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts After ETF Launch.

Bitcoin's price dropped 20% after the ETF launch. We can expect a similar drop in ETH before it goes up. ETH price has already dropped 11% after the ETF launch, and we can expect the bearish move to continue for the next few days before we see a bullish move.

A good buying opportunity is expected once ETH experiences a 15-20% correction.

ETH continues to struggle as it grapples with significant resistance and support levels on the 4-hour chart. With a closing price of $3,160.39, the cryptocurrency shows signs of bearish momentum as it hovers near critical support levels. 

Currently, ETH is trading near the $3,180.53 mark, a crucial resistance level that it must surpass to regain bullish traction. The next significant resistance levels are at $3,408.08 and $3,419.6. However, Ethereum faces substantial downward pressure, and the support levels to watch are at $3,086.91, $3,077.2, and $3,070.0. A breach below these support levels could trigger further declines.

Technical indicators present a bearish outlook. The 9 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is trending below the 20 EMA, indicating a downtrend. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) histogram is consistently negative, signaling sustained bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD line is significantly below the signal line, further confirming the downtrend.

The RSI (Relative Strength Index) remains below 30, suggesting that ETH is in oversold territory. This could indicate a potential for a short-term rebound, but the overall sentiment remains bearish.

For traders considering entry and exit points, the current market conditions suggest caution. For short trades, entering around the $3,180.53 resistance level could be favorable, with potential exit points at the support levels of $3,086.91 and $3,077.2. Conversely, if the Ethereum price shows signs of a reversal and breaks above $3,180.53, long positions could be considered, targeting the resistance levels at $3,408.08 and $3,419.6.

We discussed just yesterday that Ethereum's short-term chart contains a couple of bearish signs. Unfortunately, they played out mercilessly today, and ETH broke through a couple of support areas.

Let's take a look and discuss what's needed to return to the bullish path.

1 - Within a couple of hours, ETH broke three support lines. It started with the upper cloud line and was followed by a break out of the cloud and the break of the 3,300 support. Logically, this was followed by a sharp dip.

2 - Currently, the previous cloud level at ~3,200 provides some support. However, we have to consider this intermediate support only.

3 - In addition to the bearish signs, the future Ichimoku cloud has turned red, indicating an upcoming bearish trend.

4 - Finally, the price also broke below the EMA200 on the 4H chart is holding only slightly above this crucial line on the daily chart.

Way Forward

It looks like the "sell-the-news" scenario will play out, and we will encounter a sell-off before we continue higher. In the long run, nothing has changed from my perspective. We are still all set for 4k during the next weeks. However, in the short term, we might experience more blood and dive down to the 2,8k level. At the same time, the 2,8k level must hold!

As mentioned in my linked post to this below Eth could go to $4000 this week. I think today the 23rd it will make an attempt, the rumored day of eth trading.

 Targets: 
Trade target 1 $3860 book 75%
Trade target 2 $4000 close

 (As usual will look to close out target manually so will keep TP open. If momentum is strong which I think it will be, it might just zip to 4k but urgency to take profit from $3860 should be exercised.) 

I anticipated that it would happen before hand but it shifted temporary bearish on 1hr and 4hr along with bitcoin.

Then surprising in just a few hrs early this morning it shifted back bullish and now holding above $3500 resistance area, that took a lot of volume. 

 Get Ready 

This could pop any moment. Already seen signs of whale activity but need a bit more confirmation that the current correction on the 1hr tf is over before entering. 

Stop loss
Main invalidation base on 1hr is below $3435 area but I'll be looking to get my stop below the next potential HL that it will form now somewhere around $3480 or lower it depends on how the price action and market structure develops . 

 Reward 
Could be a 14-20 RR move. I'll size up a little bit, not too much , just a little above normal risk.

Mindset
Even though this could turn out to be a big opportunity its only a probable outcome , an edge not a guarantee outcome, keep risk the same or close to normal risk. Can always lose either through invalidation or just spikes. Keep emotion under control by sticking with the plan.

I'll post when I enter the trade. It will likely be soon and it could pop so turn notification on if anyone wants to see when I enter. Though you should be prepare to make a decision as I might not be fast enough to update, just don't act impulsely. Preferrable in this scenario you want to get a HL/double bottom type of structure on the 15 min tf or an engulf candle on 30 min-1hr tf with volume.

Today was the first day ETH ETFs were traded.
The price of ETH is now correcting because this news is already known and has become just a formality.
What‚Äôs important about these ETFs are the volumes, which in the case of the #BTCETF approval initially put selling pressure on the market, followed by a larger upward movement.

I have two scenarios for this 1-day (1D) timeframe:

üü¢ Green Scenario (Bullish): Possible recovery and increase in the coming days.

‚ö´ Black Scenario (Bearish): Short-term correction, but potentially very bullish in the medium term because a lot of liquidity has formed in that marked area and we also have an FVG (imbalance) on the W timeframe + resistance on that parallel channel.

Watch the market closely 3100-3300 and consider these scenarios in your trading strategies!
___
The Ethereum chart highlights a robust uptrend that started early this year, peaking in February before entering a consolidation phase. This pattern indicates strong buying interest followed by a phase where traders and investors are assessing their positions.

Key Technical Observations:

Resistance Levels (R1 and R2):

The first resistance (R1) is at $3,430.29, which previously acted as both support and resistance, indicating a pivotal price point.
The second resistance (R2) at $4,134.34 represents the peak of the recent price rally and is crucial for confirming a continuation of the bullish trend.
Support Levels (S1 and S2):

The primary support (S1) at $2,837.73 is critical as it lines up with historical price reactions and the Fibonacci retracement level of 0.5, a common reversal zone.
The secondary support (S2) at $2,112.62 is near the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, often considered the last line of defense in a bullish market.
Fibonacci Retracement:

The Fibonacci levels are drawn from the low of $1,521 to the high of $4,093.92, and they help identify potential reversal points. The 0.5 and 0.618 levels are particularly significant due to their common usage as decision points in price action trading.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):

The MACD line is currently below the signal line, and the histogram is in the negative territory, which suggests bearish momentum in the short term. This requires close monitoring as a potential crossover above the signal line could indicate a shift back to bullish momentum.
RSI (Relative Strength Index):

The RSI at 53.85 is near the midpoint of 50, which generally indicates a balance between buying and selling pressure. However, the slight tilt towards the oversold territory suggests that there might be an upcoming opportunity for buyers.
Conclusion and Strategy:
Given the current market conditions and the technical setup, my approach would be cautiously optimistic. I would consider entering long positions near the S1 level with a clear stop-loss order just below this level to protect against unexpected downturns. Any approach towards R1 should be viewed with readiness to take profits, especially if accompanied by signs of fading bullish momentum, such as declining volume or bearish divergences on the RSI or MACD.

Trading around these key technical levels with a well-defined risk management strategy could potentially capitalize on the volatility and provide significant returns. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remain vigilant and adapt to any new market developments that could affect Ethereum's price trajectory.

üß† From a structural perspective, the double top short structure is intact and there is still an expectation of a pullback. It is easy to see from the chart that we are currently blocked by the downward trend line and the price is in the resistance zone, so a decline is very likely.

This chart represents the Ethereum to Tether (ETHUSDT) pair on a 4-hour timeframe. The analysis of the chart includes several key price levels and potential price movement patterns.

1. **Key Price Levels:**
   - **$3950.23**: A strong resistance level where the price has reacted in the past. üìà
   - **$3720.77**: Another resistance level near the current price (3736.24). üìä
   - **$3410.90**: A support level to which the price might return. üìâ

2. **Potential Patterns:**
   - Two curved arrows indicate two possible scenarios:
     - **Bullish Scenario**: If the price breaks above the $3720.77 level, it is likely to move towards the $3950.23 level. üöÄ
     - **Bearish Scenario**: If the price fails to break the $3720.77 level and declines, it might reach the support level of $3410.90. üîª

3. **Reaction to Price Level:**
   - The text on the chart "Waiting for reaction to level-price" suggests that the analyst is waiting for the price to react to the $3720.77 level to decide which direction the price will move. ‚è≥

4. **Black Arrows:**
   - The black arrows on the chart indicate key points where the price has reacted in the past. üìç

In summary, this analysis suggests that if the price can break the $3720.77 resistance level, it will likely move towards the next resistance at $3950.23. However, if it fails to break this level, it might return to the support level at $3410.90. The analyst is waiting for the price reaction at these key points to determine the next direction.

Update on this idea: 

I think wave 3 of 5 is now complete with an ending diagonal wave, so now either wave 4 has ended at the 0.236 fib level and we move up in wave 5 to $3670 or so, or move down to the 0.382 fib level before a push to $3670 or so.

A break below $3148 in short term would invalidate this idea (wave 4 crossing wave 1)

Evening once again fellas,

Don't be surprised to see ETH to hit this within the next year.

Hello everyone. I suspect that Ethereum might correct to the $2,800-$3,000 range. The drop could be around ¬±20%.




Market makers might want to execute one last shakeout of long traders before initiating alt season and a bullish run. Don't forget about projects like Hamster Kombat, which could bring 100-200 million people to crypto exchanges (rumor has it the token listing has been postponed to August 18, 2024).

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  is ending the sell-off phase. Buyers have held a strong support area, forming an intermediate bottom. The liquidity capture led to a rebound, which can move into the phase of the uptrend continuation.



Fundamentally, the main focus is on ETH-ETFs. Earlier traders were positive about the initial rumors of approval, now the important milestone is the admission of ETFs to trading, judging by the feedback and SEC sentiment, this could happen very soon (within 1-2 weeks) 
Technically, strong buyers appear in the 2800-2900 zone (judging by candlestick patterns and volume growth), restraining the market from falling and gaining momentum with the purpose of further strengthening (local price movement has a consolidation character).
The trigger area for buyers is 3200. Accordingly, further final consolidation of the price above MA-200 and breakout of 3200 may become the reason for strengthening, the target of which may be 4000-4800. 

 Resistance levels: 3200, 3357
Support levels: MA-200, 2868 

Fundamentally, the situation is positive, traders are waiting for the news from SEC. Technically, on local timeframes there are prerequisites for a bullish mood, on D1 a rebound from strong support is forming. Accordingly, the overall tandem is signaling a possible further rise to 4K. 

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚ô¶Ô∏é ETHEREUM ‚ô¶Ô∏é ;)

Hello crypto trading lover
here is my view on ethereum if you trade only bitcoin then trade
ethereum also for good volatility ..
My level and chart will help you to view on etherum 
when to trade and how to trade..
___
TLDR summary:

Entered eth long not too long ago. At the potential bottom of the move to come.

Target $3860, and possible $4000 depending on the momentum.

Deep analysis:

The technical looks beautiful for it. All tf pretty much in sync. weekly, daily, 1hr and I would say 4hr if not for the recent close about 13 minutes ago, we need to break back above $3542 area to confirm bullish again on the 4hr(or make new LH and break that on the way up-unlikely scenario), thats my main concern right now- so this might not be the exact bottom but not far from its if not .

The Fact that we close the 4hr tf structure below $3484 area a while ago suggest lower prices because bears were strong enough to actually cause the price to close below support. I'll be looking for signs to early exit around $3518-$3453 if price is struggling to push back up for 2-3RR. If am awake, at that time it's 3:53 am right now... If we do go lower I don't think we'll break pass $3453 area, that's next area for potential bottom tha'ts very likely to hold.

From current price of post is roughly 12RR

Another factor is timing. Big pumps tend to happen during NY session around 9-10 am so that's some alpha, there's a logical reason for and no it's not some ICT algo killzone BS. The reason is Volume-volume will spike because big pockets will be making a decisions around that time and about 5 other important time period in each day-hint-it's base on closure of certain candlesticks for confirmation. 

Anyways we just need to hold $3500 area by that time for major volume to kick in, so if you reading this before NY and want to position you still have time, I just choose to enter now because the price is low and it be a great entry if sticks...but from experience probably nothing much happen before nyc still--can make some money.

On the fundamental side eth etf is schedule to start trading this week on the 23rd. That's 1 day away. It makes sense to pump before the actual event in anticipation rather than the day of. Also biden annoucement to step down happen on the weekend...that should cause increase volatility too as people are still digesting the news, paired that with the fail assassination on trump that is still relatively fresh news. Trump is bullish for crypto so these events pretty much increase his odds of winning thus bullish for crypto.

And back to technical if you zoom out on the daily you'll find a very clean inverse head and shoulder pattern, if you go up more to the weekly you'll see there's clear space before next resistance around $3860 so this thing could really pop and you  miss entry if not prepared because there's nothing much in it's way to suppress price when the demand spikes with volume and people start to fomo. So watch for pump later on around 9-11 am est. Can happen before that though, not often but can happen...Alright it's 4 am. Need to get my 3hr nap.

With the Ethereum ETF decision just days away, ETH has made a massive breakout play in an effort to front run a positive ETF outcome, the approval of  VanEck and ArkInvest/ 21Shares ETH ETFs  on the  23rd & 24th May respectively. 

In terms of price action and charting this is how I see it. Now that price has broken out from the downtrend and hit the Bearish OB as shown, I think many were caught of guard and expected any sort of volatility to come on the day of the decisions. Instead it seems many have decided to  front run the decision  and go long which opens up more challenges. I think ETH had  priced in a rejection of the ETF at ~¬£3K , with how the SEC has viewed ETH and it's stance on insisting it's a security,  Coinbase estimated a 30-40% chance of an approval  last weekend. Now that price has risen almost as if we already have news of approval I think that should the ETF be denied we could fall straight  back down to $3K  area with support areas shown as targets on the chart. This would print a Bart Simpson style pattern and many Longs will be devastated.

On the other hand, Bloomberg have said that the  chances of approval has gone from 25% to 75%  and the chart shows this new level of optimism. If the ETF is approved I could see ETH using this current level as a base to target new local highs and  close the gap on BTC dominance.

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  managed to print a slight gain over the past 24 hours to trade at $3,497.30 at press time.

This slight uptick in the ETH price comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of multiple spot Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds).

A Bearish Chart Pattern Forms on ETH‚Äôs Daily Chart

The Ethereum price was rejected by the major resistance level at $3,555 in the last 48 hours, resulting in a retracement to the 9 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) line. If the leading altcoin falls below this technical crutch, ETH might be at risk of falling to the $3,351.15 support, which is also confluent with the 20 EMA line.

Traders and investors will want to take note of the bearish rising wedge pattern that has formed on ETH‚Äôs daily chart. This specific pattern suggests the Ethereum price might undergo a strong correction. If this pattern is validated, the crypto‚Äôs price could fall below the $3,351.15 support and possibly fall to as low as $3,094.39 in the short to medium term.

However, the Ethereum price might still bounce off of the $3,351.15 support if the rising wedge pattern plays out. This could be a pull back before the altcoin rallies above $3,555 to potentially rise to $3,677.31.

This potential price drop might not even happen if ETH manages to close a daily candle above $3,555 within the next 3 days. In this alternative scenario, the Ethereum price might attempt a challenge at the aforementioned $3,677.31 resistance.

Technicals Warn the Ethereum Price Might Pull Back

Technical indicators on ETH‚Äôs daily chart warn the Ethereum price might drop in the next 48 hours. Both the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators are on the verge of triggering major bearish flags.

Although the MACD line is currently positioned bullishly above the MACD Signal line, the narrowing gap between the two indicators warns that the positive cycle might soon come to an end. Meanwhile, the RSI is closing in on its Simple Moving Average (SMA) line on the daily chart, which could signal a bearish shift in strength if the two lines cross in the next 48-72 hours.

No one can be sure when the US SEC will approve the spot Ethereum ETF registration statement, which is expected to be in next few weeks. Now it's just a matter of how long the SEC wants to delay.

Ethereum has been trading within a parallel channel since the beginning of the month, and is currently using the daily SMMA as support, if we break out of the channel with confirmation, I believe we will easily see Ethereum return to $4,000 or close to it in the short term, that will be bullish for the Altcoins.
___
While BTC had v. nice run from the lows ETH looks much worse, I dont think V recovery is in play, there wasnt that much liquidations yet, I think ETH will hit new lows and BTC will go somewhere towards double bottom.

The news of the Ethereum Spot ETF launching next Tuesday has been circulating widely online in recent days. Will the launch trigger a bullish run for  PHEMEX:ETHUSDT.P ?

Here are some key points to consider regarding the ETH price. 
Impressive Rise: ETH rose from $1565 (October 20, 2023) to $4098 (March 12, 2024), a significant 161.7% increase in just five months.

Recent Price Action: The 1D chart shows ETH forming a potential Head & Shoulders pattern; 1st Top is at 12th March 2024 and 2nd Top is at 27th May 2024. However, a solid base (support level) has also formed around $2800. 

Current Price Action: ETH is currently facing resistance at $3535 and consolidating between $3517 and $3230. This retracement from the resistance level is normal and could be a sign of preparation for a future bullish run.


There are two main possibilities following the launch of the ETH ETF.
Scenario 1: Bullish Run
If the ETF news ignites a bullish run, we can expect a high-volume breakout above the $3535 resistance level. This could be an opportunity to chase the highs, but remember to set a stop loss in case this become a false breakout. Volume is Key here. 

Scenario 2: Continued Consolidation
The price might continue to consolidate around $3517-$3230 or even drop to create a higher low above $2800. This could be a good opportunity to buy low.


 Note:  If you think ETH ETF launched will have positive impact on ETH price, you can leverage our In-house Grid Bots to capture the profit on both scenarios above. Try it out at our website & join the 280k successful traders on our Trading Bots.

Hi traders and investors!

I have chosen 4 assets on which to look for purchases.
The price of each asset formed a sideways trend on the daily TF and is now at the lower boundaries of these sideways (above the lower boundaries).

ETHUSDT. Current buyer vector 10-11 on the daily TF. Potential target ‚Äì 3977.

On the hourly timeframe, the price has formed a sideways trend and now the buyer is attacking the upper boundary of the sideways trend. You can search for purchases:
 
 after the launch of a long trend on the hourly timeframe (the buyer protects the exit from the sideways trend on the hourly timeframe and the formation of a new buyer impulse)
 from protection by the buyer of the lower boundary of the sideways trend 2822 -2810.
 

BNBUSDT. Current buyer vector 10-11 on the daily TF. Potential target ‚Äì 645.2

On the hourly time frame, the price has formed a sideways trend and now the price is near the upper boundary of the sideways pattern. You can search for purchases:
 
 after the launch of a long trend on the hourly timeframe (the buyer protects the exit from the sideways trend on the hourly timeframe and the formation of a new buyer impulse)
 from protection by the buyer of the lower boundary of the sideways trend 471 - 454.
 

NEARUSDT. Current buyer vector 5-6 on the daily TF. Potential target ‚Äì 6.89

There is a short trend on the hourly timeframe. It is advisable to look for purchases when the buyer overcomes the beginning of the last impulse of the seller 5.003, protects this level, and forms a new impulse.

RNDRUSDT. Current buyer vector 8-9 on the daily TF. Potential target ‚Äì 11.88
 
There is a short trend on the hourly timeframe. It is advisable to look for purchases when the buyer overcomes the beginning of the last impulse of the seller 8.273, protects this level, and forms a new impulse.

Chart Patterns and Trendlines 

 1. Head and Shoulders Pattern (Bearish)
     - Left Shoulder: Formed around 3,450 USDT.
    - Head: Reached a peak around 3,550 USDT.
    - Right Shoulder: Formed around 3,450 USDT again.
    - The neckline, which was breached, is around 3,300 USDT, indicating a bearish reversal.

 2. Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern (Bullish)
     - Left Shoulder: Formed around 3,200 USDT.
    - Head: Reached a low around 3,000 USDT.
    - Right Shoulder: Forming around the current price level of 3,498.35 USDT.
    - The neckline for this pattern is around the 3,500 USDT level. If the price breaks above this neckline, it suggests a bullish reversal.

 3. Descending Channel
     - Ethereum was trading within a descending channel, marked by parallel downward-sloping trendlines.
    - The breakout from this channel around mid-July indicates a reversal of the previous downtrend.

   Key Support and Resistance Levels 
 
 1. Support Levels
     - 3,248.81 USDT: A key support level marked on the chart, aligning with the breakout point from the descending channel and the potential right shoulder of the inverse head and shoulders pattern.
    - If the price falls below this level, the next support can be around the previous lows at 3,000 USDT.

 2. Resistance Levels
     - 3,976.07 USDT: The next significant resistance level, which is also a target for the potential inverse head and shoulders pattern.

  Price Projections
 
 1. Bullish Scenario
     - If Ethereum holds above the 3,248.81 USDT support level and breaks above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern (around 3,500 USDT), the projected target is around 3,976.07 USDT.
    - This target aligns with a previous high and a psychological resistance level.

 2. Bearish Scenario
     - If Ethereum fails to hold the 3,248.81 USDT support, it might retest the lower support of around 3,000 USDT.
    - A fall below 3,000 USDT could indicate further downside, potentially revisiting the lows around 2,750 USDT.

  Trading Strategy
 
 1. Long Position
     - Consider entering around the 3,248.81 USDT support level, with a target of 3,976.07 USDT, especially if the price breaks the neckline around 3,500 USDT.
    - Set a stop-loss below 3,200 USDT to manage risk.

 2. Short Position
     - If the price fails to hold the 3,248.81 USDT level, consider shorting with a target towards 3,000 USDT and below.
    - A stop-loss above 3,300 USDT can be set to manage risk.

   Summary 
 - Ethereum's price action shows the potential formation of a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern.
- Key support and resistance levels at 3,248.81 USDT and 3,976.07 USDT respectively should be closely watched.
- Trading strategies should be adaptive to the price movements around these critical levels, with proper risk management in place.

If the price goes lower than wave AB, then wave C can reach 123.6% - 161.8% of wave AB. I am cautious for going long on Ethereum because Bitcoin CME Futures chart has a cap between 57895 and 60845, which can pull down Ethereum if Bitcoin retest or fills that cap. Right now I am staying neutral on Ethereum until I have seen a clear direction.

Targets for #ethereum long

Tp 1 üéØ$3560 -- 50% üíµ
Tp 2 üéØ$3584 -- 25% üíµ
Tp 3 üéØ$3640 -- close üíµ

Mainly going off targets above but have to consider a potential early close/partial @ $3523 if price have difficulty breaking the resistance there.

Fundamentals isn't apart of my edge but good confluence. Eth ETF schedule to start trading on 23rd this month. People usually buy expectation and sell the event so it makes sense that the price action is quite bullish today and I anticipate continuation. Might even pump higher than my targets above...can always  jump back in. Its a 13 RR trade given it plays out according to plan.

Its all about probability but if anyone reading this after things play out exactly as anticipated...I told you so :)

Ethereum - inside bull flag , could see it's trading in falling wedge pattern and it's broken out and retested that trendline. 
Break out from here is imminent. 
Soon 3700-3800$.
If there is any fake out likely we will visit red box of 3250-3300 area. 
Long term , retest ATH very likely now.

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìàETH has been overall bullish, trading within the rising red channel.

Currently, it is hovering around the lower bound of the channel.

As long as the structure marked in red at $3,200 holds, we will be looking for trend-following buy setups on lower timeframes, targeting the $3,600 zone.

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

Hi everyone,

After ETH ETF approval Ethereum price increased on over 30% rising from 2800-3000 support area to almost 4000 level. Two months later price came to the same spot from where it started.

Within couple weeks actual trading of those ETH ETF should start and this once again bullish news that can push Ethereum price to 4000 level.  Only time will tell if it happens or not but at least in the first days price should rise significantly.

As always Ethereum price heavily depends on Bitcoin price action and if it goes down then start trading of ETH ETF won't help ETH price to rise.

So far Ethereum price recovers better than BTC price but if Bitcoin resumes downtrend movement then ETH will follow.

At the moment it's important for ETH price rise to 3650 level as it's first strong resistance and if BTC price rises above 60k then this will be very possible task for Ethereum.

Please, do not forget to boost this idea & share it with your friends; thanks.

This update provides an analysis of Ethereum (ETH/USD) on the weekly timeframe, focusing on the recent price movements, key levels, and potential bullish scenarios.

Analysis:

Directional Movement Index (DMI):

As previously mentioned, the DMI was ready for a cross, and it has now confirmed.
This cross indicates a strengthening bullish momentum.
Recent Price Action:

ETH has pumped from $2900, confirming the bullish trend.
The price is holding well above $3250, a critical support level.
Key Levels:

Immediate resistance levels to watch are $3800 and $3900.
A potential move to $4000 is possible if ETH maintains its momentum.
Weekly Candle Close:

A weekly candle close above $3500 will be a strong confirmation of the bullish trend.
This could propel ETH towards $3700 and higher targets.
Conclusion:
ETH is showing strong bullish signals with the DMI cross and recent price action. Maintaining support above $3250 and achieving a weekly close above $3500 will likely confirm a move to $3700 and beyond.

Current resistance is at 3085$ i hope soon we will pass this and will head toward the 2nd resistance zone that is 3280 $
too much liquidity at 3500 $ area 
Long Long long until we hold 2800$ 
Cheers and follow me for more

ETH is looking and setting up nicely..along with BTC resting around some resistance.

IF we break above the highs and hold expect us to aggressively trade towards our final TP 
IF we break below the current lows of the range expect some pa towards the HTF sellside liquidity. 

Keep an eye on BTC and how it plays around its current highs.

Overall plan remains the same on ETH...

No need to OVERTRADE or OVERLEVERAGE...FOLLOW THE MARKET...

Currently trading at $3,468, ETH is poised on the edge of a significant technical formation that could dictate its short-term future. Let's dive into the charts and unravel the story they're telling us.

The Hourly Dance: Descending Triangle in Focus
Over the past 48 hours, ETHUSDT has been painting a compelling picture on the hourly chart. A descending triangle has formed, with the upper boundary at $3,480 and the lower support hovering around $3,373. This pattern, often seen as a bullish formation, has traders on the edge of their seats.

The descending triangle is like a coiled spring, with price action compressing between these two levels. Each touch of the resistance and support adds tension, potentially leading to a powerful breakout.

Technical Indicators: The Plot Thickens
Let's add some color to our analysis with a few key technical indicators:
Moving Averages: The 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages are converging, suggesting a potential golden cross on the horizon. This bullish signal could provide additional fuel for an upward move.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): Currently, the RSI is floating in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. This gives ETH room to move in either direction without immediate resistance from this indicator.

The Bigger Picture: Daily Chart Bullish Target
Zooming out to the daily chart, the outlook becomes even more exciting. A successful breakout from this descending triangle could set the stage for a significant rally. The long-term price target? A mouth-watering 10% upside from current levels.
Imagine the possibilities if ETH breaks above $3,480 with conviction. We could be looking at prices north of $3,800 in the coming weeks!

Market Sentiment: Regulatory Winds of Change
It's not just the charts that are stirring up excitement. Recent regulatory updates have been sending ripples through the crypto space. While the specifics remain hazy, there's a growing sense that clearer regulations could pave the way for increased institutional adoption of Ethereum.

This backdrop of potential regulatory clarity adds an extra layer of intrigue to our technical setup. Could positive news be the catalyst that sends ETH soaring through resistance?
Trading the Triangle: Entry Points and Risk Management

For those looking to ride this potential bullish wave, here are some key levels to watch:

Breakout Entry: A decisive move above $3,480 could signal the start of a strong uptrend. Consider setting alerts at this level.

Support Entry: For the more risk-tolerant, entries near the $3,373 support could offer an attractive risk-reward ratio.

Moving Average Crossover: Keep an eye on the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. A bullish crossover could provide additional confirmation of upward momentum.
Remember, always use proper risk management. Consider setting stop losses below the $3,373 support to protect your capital.

üìä#ETH is in a contradictory range‚ö†Ô∏è

üß†We are currently in a conflict zone. There are reasons to support both rises and falls, so we can only be conservative. If we have good profits, we need to reduce our holdings to reduce risks, and then look forward to more.

‚û°Ô∏èJudging from the current development, if we choose to continue sideways consolidation to digest the selling pressure here, a bullish cup-and-handle structure may eventually form, and the next resistance area worthy of our attention is near 3700

‚û°Ô∏èIf we just complete the target of 3481-3513 of the small long structure and then choose to fall back, then a very classic bearish head and shoulders structure may form in the selling area, which means that we will enter a deep callback stage.

‚ö†Ô∏èBut no matter how the market develops, we can't guess it, and we don't need to guess it. We just need to try it in specific areas. Congratulations to the friends who followed Wolf King to print money. üí∞üçª

ETH AS EXPECTED CLEAN STRUCTURE üìö


üëâThe price action remains clear and consistent. Additionally, the price has rejected our previously marked lower zone, as noted in our prior analysis attached to the chart.


üëâMeanwhile, although the price has moved higher, it remains slightly bearish from a long-term perspective, trading within a flat falling channel that encompasses our overall movement. As the price approaches the upper falling trendline, we can look for new short positions in line with the prevailing trend. üìö

Hello Everyone,

Let's take a quick look at the neatest and most accurate in terms of TA I ever come across.
ETHUSDT smoothly retested the ATH level (made in 2018) between mid-2022 to early 2023. Now, it is forming an ascending triangle and will soon hit the resistance level of $4686 which is also its ATH. The support trend line from the ATL is acting as a strong support trend line.
Here are the key levels to watch:

Resistance Level: $4390-$4686
Higher Support level: $2010- $1855
Strong support level: $1220- $1048

Happy trading!!

In checking the 1-hour time frame:

Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, has not yet been able to break its previous major ceiling 
Therefore, SPIK's movement to break the ceiling will be on its way before the market, but it can receive the appropriate liquidity to move with high momentum from the price range of 3437.21. 
And we will continue the upward trend until the price of 3624.65

hello guys.

Let's analyze ETH!

 ‚úé Current Price and Structure  
- Current Price: The current price of Ethereum is approximately $3,158.24.
- Trend: The chart shows Ethereum in a descending parallel channel, indicating a bearish trend.

 ‚úé Key Patterns  
- Double Bottom: At the lower end of the chart, a double bottom formation is seen around the $3,110 level. This is a bullish reversal pattern suggesting that the downtrend might be losing momentum.

 ‚úéTrendlines and Targets  
- Descending Trendline: The chart shows a descending trendline that Ethereum is currently attempting to break. This line represents the resistance level in the ongoing bearish trend.
- Target Line: The target line, marked at $3,274.48, is a significant resistance level that Ethereum might aim for if it breaks above the descending trendline.
- Bottom Line: The bottom line of the descending channel acts as a support level.
- Target Line: Extending below the bottom line, it suggests further potential downside if the support is broken.

  ‚úéIndicators  
- Price Action: The price action suggests a potential breakout from the descending channel. The price is approaching the target of $3,274.48 after forming a double bottom, which is a bullish signal.
- Resistance Levels: The significant resistance levels to watch are the descending trendline and the $3,274.48 target. Breaking these levels might indicate a reversal of the bearish trend.

 Conclusion 
- Bullish Scenario: If Ethereum manages to break above the descending trendline and reach the target of $3,274.48, it could signal a bullish reversal, potentially leading to further upward movement.
- Bearish Scenario: If Ethereum fails to break the descending trendline and drops below the current support levels, it might continue its downtrend within the descending channel.

Overall, the chart suggests cautious optimism with key resistance levels needing to be broken for a confirmed bullish reversal. Traders should watch these levels closely and consider the patterns formed for making informed trading decisions.

After a Consolidation Spanning 1.5 Years  BINANCE:ETHUSDT  Poised for Upward Momentum Toward Supply Zone and Fibonacci 0.786 Level.
___
In recent trading sessions,  BINANCE:ETHUSDT  has exhibited notable movements, reflecting a dynamic interplay between bullish and bearish forces. Closing prices have fluctuated within a range. Recent fluctuations have placed ETH at critical junctures with significant support and resistance levels coming into focus.

ETH is currently testing a resistance zone around $3,408.08. Should the price manage to break through this level, the next significant resistance is at $3,419.6, followed by a stronger resistance at $3,460.5. On the downside, ETH has solid support at $3,379.74, with additional supports at $3,371.28 and $3,361.69. The price action around these levels will be crucial in determining the next directional move for ETH.

The 9 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 20 EMA indicate that the short-term momentum is slightly bullish, with the 9 EMA trending above the 20 EMA. This crossover suggests potential upward momentum, but the narrowing gap between the two EMAs could imply a possible consolidation phase or a reversal if bearish sentiment gains strength.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator presents a bullish scenario. The MACD line remains above the signal line, although the histogram shows diminishing bullish momentum. This could indicate a weakening in the upward trend, potentially leading to a period of sideways movement or a minor correction.

Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated from overbought levels, moving from highs of 84.42 to more moderate readings around 65.24. This suggests that while the bullish momentum has cooled off, there is still room for potential upside before the Ethereum price enters overbought territory again.

For traders looking to capitalize on the current market conditions, several entry and exit points can be considered. For long positions, a breakout above the resistance at $3,408.08 could signal an entry point, with potential targets set at $3,419.6 and $3,460.5. Stop-loss orders could be placed below the support at $3,379.74 to manage risk.

Conversely, for short trades, an entry point might be identified if ETH fails to sustain above $3,408.08 and begins to retreat. Targets for short positions could be set at the support levels of $3,379.74, $3,371.28, and $3,361.69. A stop-loss above the resistance at $3,419.6 could help mitigate potential losses.

As always, traders should monitor these technical levels closely and remain vigilant for any shifts in market sentiment that could impact their trading strategies.

Eth ETF Loading On the 23rd, trading on the ether is launched, which means large volumes, a new influx of customers, and of course, growth to new historical highs, and this is about $5,100, I'm waiting for a scenario with a small correction, maybe there will be a new minimum of 2750, the removal of traders in the footsteps, and a hike up to the next maximum!
___
The price perfectly fulfilled my previous idea. It hit the target level.  BINANCE:ETHUSDT  is experiencing a pullback after breaking out of the downward trendline, which previously acted as strong resistance. Given this context, it's likely that the trendline will provide strong support if the price tests it. The price has already broken through the resistance level where we saw a price rebound earlier. On the daily timeframe, yesterday's close showed a strong bullish candle. I think that the price may pull back about a third of the range from yesterday's high to low, before making another push upwards. My target is previous resistance zone 3625.00

This analysis focuses on Ethereum (ETH/USD) on a weekly timeframe, highlighting key support and resistance levels, recent price movements, and indicators signaling potential future trends.

Analysis:

Support and Rebound:

ETH has rebounded nearly 17% from a key support level, forming a strong base around $3250.
This support level coincides with the lower Bollinger Band, adding confidence to the strength of this bounce.
Key Resistance and Bollinger Bands:

The mid-Bollinger Band is currently around $3400, which is a critical resistance level.
A break above this level would indicate a significant bullish trend continuation.
Directional Movement Index (DMI):

The DMI is nearing a cross on the weekly timeframe, suggesting an imminent shift in trend.
A positive cross would support the bullish outlook, potentially driving ETH higher.
Potential Scenarios:

Bullish Scenario: If ETH breaks above $3400, we could see a continuation of the uptrend, targeting higher levels in the coming weeks.
Bearish Scenario: If ETH fails to break $3400 and retraces, watch for support around $3250. A break below this could lead to further downside.
Conclusion:
Keep an eye on the $3400 resistance level and the DMI cross for confirmation of the next significant move. This analysis suggests a strong bullish potential if key levels are breached.

Interesting fractal here overlaying BTC at 25k onto the ETH rectangle. 

While we've been talking about 13k as a possible extension target this cycle, we have now seen an equilibrium between the bear market 1.618 extension, and the local 4.236. 

Of course the fractal is just a little speculation, it does help illustrate the potential, and seems to align with some of the critical zones within the fib sequence here. 

Id imagine this would be result of the ETF being approved, and should come alongside a new "alt season", which is also supported by some other metrics ive been going over.

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà ETH has been trading within a big range in the shape of a symmetrical triangle.

Currently, ETH is hovering around the lower bound of the range.

üèπ Thus, as long as the support holds, we expect a bullish movement towards the $3,500 round number.

In parallel, if the $2,800 is broken downward, a movement towards the $2,300 mark would be expected.

üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

Same as we said last week. Although BTC and ETH did not react as strongly as gold when the CPI was announced. However, during the weekend when trading activity was relatively weak, both BTC and ETH rose and bulls have maintained so far. Excellent CPI has shown that the date for interest rate cuts is gradually approaching.

Funds will gradually flow from the US dollar to risky assets. And the funds in the U.S. stock market may also face the risk of outflows because of its excellent performance in the past year. Traders will choose the riskier stock market. But cryptocurrencies will be one of its destination.

If you are not a professional macro analyst, you may hesitate before the rise comes and miss the best trading opportunities. But it doesn‚Äôt matter, you can choose our TSB indicator. As mentioned in our report last Friday. The TSB indicator prompted a BUY signal on Friday and has risen by more than 8% without any leverage.

Last but not least, we are on the way to a rate cut and the cryptocurrency has pulled back lower due to a series of FUD. Don't miss out any opportunities of open position because of indecision, hurry up and use our indicators.

üìä#ETH reaches the target area ‚úîÔ∏è

üß† From a structural point of view, we started the rebound with the double bottom structure as the supporting force. We have successfully reached the ideal target area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis structure. Therefore, it is not recommended to chase the rise in the selling area. The action that should be done in the selling area is to sell.

‚û°Ô∏èSo we have closed the long orders we held. Congratulations to our friends who followed Wolf King to print money and obtained a profit of 1300%+. üí∞üöÄüåïüçª

___
Ethereum has recovered from the lower boundary of the descending channel and is currently trading above $3,300. The next significant resistance level lies around $3,400. A break above this level could see ETH target the $3,600 mark.

Support is strong at $2,950, which aligns with the previous consolidation zone and the lower boundary of the descending channel.

A break and close above $3,400 with high volume could target $3,600 and above.

Failure to break $3,400 could lead to a retest of the $2,950 support area.

Conversely, a bounce from the support level could lead to a short-term rally towards the resistance zone.

Ethereum (ETH/USDT) Analysis 

 üí∞ Welcome to Your Channel! 
Welcome to our channel where we delve into the intricacies of financial markets. Today, we focus on  ETH/USDT , dissecting its current price action to uncover strategic trading opportunities. Join us as we analyze key levels and market dynamics, aiming to refine our trading strategies and maximize potential gains.


 üîç Identifying Key Levels 
The chart highlights several significant levels and zones that influence the current market behavior:

‚Ä¢ PMH & PML: Previous Month High and Low, serving as significant resistance and support levels.
‚Ä¢ Weekly High & Low: Weekly highs and lows that act as critical levels of support and resistance.
‚Ä¢ Monthly FVG: Monthly Fair Value Gap at the bottom, which held the price after sweeping the sell-side liquidity marked out.
‚Ä¢ Minor BSL & SSL: Minor Buy-side and Sell-side Liquidity, points where traders place their buy and sell orders.
‚Ä¢ IFVG: Inversion Fair Value Gap, indicating a shift in market sentiment.

 üìä Key Considerations 
‚Ä¢ PML and SSL Swept: The price ran through the previous month low and the sell-side liquidity, as anticipated from the previous analysis.
‚Ä¢ Respecting Monthly FVG: The price respected the monthly Fair Value Gap at the bottom of the chart, indicating strong support.
‚Ä¢ Creation of IFVG: The creation of the Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG) signifies a potential shift in market sentiment.
‚Ä¢ Sweeping Minor BSL: The price ran above the IFVG and swept a minor buy-side liquidity level.
‚Ä¢ Consolidation and Liquidity Creation: The current market is consolidating and creating liquidity, setting up potential future moves.

 üìà Bullish Scenario 
Given the recent price action and key considerations, the bullish scenario is favored:

‚Ä¢ Retracement for SSL: The price is expected to retrace to take out the sell-side liquidity (SSL) before continuing higher.
‚Ä¢ Continuation Higher: After sweeping the SSL, the price is likely to target higher time frame levels such as PMH or Weekly High.

 üìâ Bearish Scenario 
A bearish scenario should also be considered:

‚Ä¢ Sweeping Minor BSL: The price ran above the IFVG and swept a minor buy-side liquidity level.
‚Ä¢ Retracement for BSL: The price is expected to take out the buy-side liquidity (BSL) before continuing lower.
‚Ä¢ Continuation Lower: After sweeping the BSL, the price may revisit lower support levels such as PML or Monthly FVG.

 üîÑ Lower Time Frame Confirmation 
For both bullish and bearish scenarios, using lower time frame confirmations can enhance the trade setup:
‚Ä¢ Creating Low Resistance Liquidity: Look for the creation of low resistance buy-side or sell-side liquidity zones on lower time frames (e.g., 1-hour or 15-minute chart).

 üìä Chart Analysis Summary 
The market respected the monthly Fair Value Gap at the bottom of the chart, creating an Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG) and leading to an expansion higher, as anticipated. The price has run above the IFVG and swept a minor buy-side liquidity level. Currently, the expectation is for the price to retrace back to the sell-side liquidity and then continue higher. Key levels and zones identified in the chart will play a crucial role in determining the future price direction. Understanding these key levels and the current market behavior helps in making informed trading decisions.

Yesterday, the U.S. CPI for June was released, showing that inflation has eased far beyond expectations. Gold rose, but US stocks and BTC fell. After Powell's dovish remarks, the improvement in CPI can be regarded as a turning point in macro policy. As we often say, we are on the way to a rate cut. We do not believe that the decline in US stocks and BTC demonstrates sell the news.

We believe that funds flowing out of US stocks will flow to BTC and the stock markets of developing countries. BTC did not show strength at when the CPI was released because of the lack of funds. After funds flow into the market, BTC will have a pump, and the funds in the BTC ETF in the following days will prove this.

Therefore, at current levels, it is a good opportunity to buy high-risk assets. Funds will flow out of U.S. stocks and try aggressive investments. Whether it‚Äôs BTC or developing country stocks.

In terms of underlying selection, ETH is better than BTC. This is mainly because the ETH ETF approval date is getting closer. From the perspective of entry point, the current TSB indicator gives a BUY signal at the 4h level, which is a suitable position. The TSB indicator has successfully captured gains from declines and rallies many times over the past month.

Market Context:
Ethereum  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  is expected to remain a strong trade in the coming weeks due to the ETF narrative. Two main factors support this belief:

Institutional Inflows: Institutions are likely to provide seed money, ensuring strong flows into the ETH spot ETF.

Trade Setup:

Entry: Enter a trade at $3,000.
Take Profit:
First target: $3,250
Second target: $3,530
Third target: $3,700
Stop Loss: Set the stop loss just below $2,900.
Strategy Overview:
This strategy hinges on the anticipated positive impact of institutional involvement and reduced selling pressure, positioning ETH for potential gains in the coming weeks.

ETH mitigated this order block (1) and moved down. This order block was strong resistance zone. So Ethereum reacted this zone. Currently facing order block (4). Order block (4) is support zone.

ETH is now at wave 5 of the Market Price movement - this wave might create a new All time High Price - the price target of this wave is difficult to confirm it might rally too high or it will just sweep the previous all time high then will do the correction phase - so the safest exit point for traders is the sweep price above the all time high Price or just use fib level for price trajectory but for me I will go with the sweep and I will exit if it's go to rally higher than my exit point then its okay - profit is profit

Hello everyone, I invite you to a quick review of the ETH to USDT chart for the 4H period.  As we can see, the price is approaching leaving the local triangle, which indicates a possible direction for further movement.     

When the price starts to reverse, support levels are visible at $3,088, then support levels are visible at $3,048, and support levels are at $2,986, $2,942, and $2,885.    

However, when the price moves up again, it must overcome the resistance at $3,166 to continue towards the strong resistance at $3,264.     

Looking at the RSI indicator, we can see that we have entered the upper part of the range, but there is still room for the price to go up.

üîπThe second largest coin by market cap is now believed to benefit and outperform Bitcoin following the launch of spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. later this month.

üî∏The ETH/BTC ratio reversed after the unexpected approval of ETH ETFs by the SEC. Traders now believe that ETH's price will rise similar to BTC after its ETFs went live.

üîπThe ETHUSDT pair is currently sitting at $3,300 following the overall negative performance of the crypto market.

üî∏It is slightly below the 8 Month old trendline but hasn't officially broken the line. If it did, the next support would be the 200 MA ($3,084), 0.618 fib level ($2,903), 0.78 fib level ($2,580) and the support at $2,154.

üîπAlternatively the more likely scenario is the price continuing it's upward movement to the 0.23 fib level ($3,639), $3,944 and the resistance at $4,382.

üìä#ETH is in the resistance zone, don‚Äôt chase the rise‚ö†Ô∏è

üß†From a structural point of view, we have successfully constructed a double bottom bullish structure, so it is very reasonable to maintain the bullish view. The ideal target area for this structure is 3360-3533.

‚û°Ô∏èAlthough we are bullish, we are currently in the resistance zone. The action to be taken in the resistance zone is to reduce or close positions, so do not chase the rise in the resistance zone. If it continues to break through the resistance zone, then the next resistance zone worthy of our attention is near the neckline resistance zone.

Ethereum (ETH) against Tether (USDT) on Binance shows notable price action within a descending channel. The price is currently at $3,112.96, showing a slight increase of +1.51%.

ETH has been trading within a descending channel since early April.
The price bounces off the lower boundary and moves towards the upper boundary.

 The price found strong support in the $2,900 - $3,000 range.
The 200MA (green line) acts as significant resistance above the current price. Additionally, the upper boundary of the descending channel serves as another resistance level.

A horizontal supply zone around $3,100 to $3,200 is creating selling pressure.
The price was rejected at this level previously and is now attempting to break through again.

The 200-day moving average (200MA) is currently above the price and acts as resistance.
A breakout above the 200MA would be a bullish signal.
Volume:

Although not shown in this chart, volume is crucial in confirming breakouts or breakdowns. High volume on a breakout above the 200MA would strengthen the bullish case.
Scenarios to Watch:

A breakout above the 200MA and the upper boundary of the descending channel would confirm a bullish trend.
The next resistance levels to watch would be around $3,400 and $3,800.

A breakdown below the support zone and the lower boundary of the descending channel would indicate further downside.
Key support levels below the channel would be around $2,700 and $2,400.

The price could also consolidate within the current range of $2,900 to $3,200, forming a base before a decisive move.
Indicators and Signals:
 Monitoring RSI can help identify overbought or oversold conditions.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Crossovers in MACD can signal potential trend reversals.
 ETH is rebounding from the support trendline and testing the 200MA Watch for a breakout above the 200MA or a breakdown below the support trendline.
$3,200 (supply zone), $3,400, $3,800.
$2,900, $2,700, $2,400.
Stay alert for high-volume moves to confirm breakouts or breakdowns. This will provide a clearer direction for the next significant price action.

Hey everyone!

If you're enjoying this analysis, a thumbs up and follow would be greatly appreciated!

Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing some interesting signs on the 1-hour timeframe. Let's break down what we're seeing:

Possible Double Bottom: The chart suggests a pattern resembling a double bottom, which can be a bullish technical indicator. However, confirmation is needed.

Descending Triangle:  ETH is also forming a descending triangle pattern. This pattern can indicate a breakout in either direction, so further confirmation is required.

Here's what to watch:

Breakout: A clean break and close above the neckline of the descending triangle and the double bottom's resistance level would be a bullish signal, potentially leading to a price increase towards $3300 this week.

Invalidation: An hourly close below $2840 would weaken the bullish case.

üìä#ETH may be pumped according to the double bottom structureüöÄ

üß†From a structural perspective, we have constructed a double bottom bullish structure near the buy zone on the 1-hour level, so the probability that we will continue to rise based on this structure as support momentum is greater than the probability of falling, but when we break through the inflection point The price is in the resistance zone, so we cannot chase the increase in the resistance zone. Instead, it is reasonable to try to place some short orders.

‚û°Ô∏èFortunately, everything developed as expected, and we triggered the entry point for long orders shortly after closing the short order. There has been a good rebound, and we look forward to the further continuation of bullish power.üöÄ

I will briefly explain why I think so... I study wave analysis of charts and usually triangles are formed in the last phase before a bear market (global) on ethereum, this is exactly the figure, add to this that I expect an alt season and a flow of dominance below the 40% minimum. If you look at the BTC/eth chart, there will also be this triangle, which gives me an idea of possible movements

We have the worst week since January 2022; the biggest bearish move in 2.5 years... And you ask the question, where is the volume?

It is interesting that there is no volume; What does it mean?

‚ûñIt means that this is NOT it; that this is NOT the end.

‚ûñHuge volume will come in when the bearish action intensifies; is about to end.

‚ûñLow volume at this point, with the biggest bearish candle in years, means that we will soon experience more red. That's ok. Thanks to the fact that we know in advance, thanks to the charts, we are prepared.

üí∞ Welcome to Your Channel! 
Welcome to our channel where we delve into the intricacies of financial markets. Today, we focus on  ETH/USDT , dissecting its current price action to uncover strategic trading opportunities. Join us as we analyze key levels and market dynamics, aiming to refine our trading strategies and maximize potential gains.

 üîç Identifying Key Levels 
‚Ä¢ Previous Month High (PMH): The highest price level from the previous month, often acting as resistance.
‚Ä¢ Previous Week High (PWH): The highest price from the last week, also a resistance level.
‚Ä¢ Previous Month Low (PML): The lowest price from the previous month, serving as a significant support level.
‚Ä¢ Buy Side Liquidity (BSL): Zones where buy orders are clustered, leading to sharp upward movements when hit.
‚Ä¢ Sell Side Liquidity (SSL): Zones where sell orders are clustered, leading to sharp downward movements when hit. This has recently been taken out.
‚Ä¢ Order Block (OB): Areas where price consolidates before a significant move, acting as support or resistance.
‚Ä¢ Inversion Fair Value Gap (iFVG): When a bearish Fair Value Gap is disrespected and price trades through and above it, it becomes an iFVG, signaling a bullish condition.

 üìâ Current Price Action 
The price has taken out the PML and SSL, indicating significant sell orders have been filled. The price is currently in an inversion Fair Value Gap (iFVG).

 üîÑ Bearish Scenario 
If the iFVG fails to hold, expect continued downward momentum. Look for lower time frame confirmations to reinforce the bearish bias.

 üìà Bullish Scenario Considerations 
For a bullish reversal, the iFVG needs to remain respected. Key factors:

‚Ä¢ iFVG Respect: Holding above the iFVG suggests a reversal.
‚Ä¢ SMT Confluence: Lower time frame SMT adds to the bullish case.

 üîé Lower Time Frame Confirmation 
SMT (Smart Money Technique): Use lower time frames for SMT to confirm bullish positions. Align SMT with a respected iFVG for stronger confirmation.

 üìä Chart Analysis Summary 
SSL Taken Out: Indicates a potential bottom.
iFVG: Critical for determining continued bearish momentum or a bullish reversal.
iFVG Respect: Necessary for a bullish reversal.
Bullish Confluence: Lower time frame SMT supports potential reversal if iFVG is respected.

 üîó Correlation with Bitcoin 
Keep in mind that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are correlated pairs. When Bitcoin moves significantly in one direction, Ethereum often follows suit. This correlation can be used as an indication for taking positions on ETH.

Understanding the Correlation:
‚Ä¢ Positive Correlation: BTC and ETH prices generally move in the same direction. If Bitcoin shows signs of a bullish reversal, Ethereum is likely to follow.
‚Ä¢ Market Sentiment: Both cryptocurrencies are influenced by similar market sentiments, news, and macroeconomic factors.
‚Ä¢ Strategy: Monitor Bitcoin's key levels and price action as a leading indicator for Ethereum trades. If Bitcoin respects or disrespects certain levels, expect Ethereum to exhibit similar behavior.

 üôè Thank you for joining us!

on June we had a crazy Volume for eth and whales buys the dip which is a very good sign for eth price in future 
Eth under 1k is a most buy and 1k-2k is a dip for eth, as you can see in weekly time frame eth trys to make a W pattern an bulls try to back at 1900$

2000, 2500, 3500 and 4500$ are the most important resistance for Eth and huge opportunity for scalper traders

BTC, ETH showed the largest down move yesterday since 2022. 
This is also the deepest correction so far since 2022.

Though market rebounced to regain the bullish set up.
Market sentiment changed day by day from fear to greed very quickly.

I scratched my earlier BTC bought at 58850 at a small lost at 57850. I look to reposition myself into sub 55k when mkt is testing the low again, looking for about 5% improve in position. BTC can go down to 52k if countinue broken

I hold on to my 3300 ETH and recently bought more at 2850 to punt on ETH trading expected on 15Jul. % wise BTC have higher chance and better run. I will reposition 1/2 into BTC

Hopefully when my full fund comes during the week 7-14/7, I can increase my positions

Also be wary about the possibilities of "bull market is over" and getting caught
___
Many are already disappointed by the recent sharp drop in cryptocurrencies. The decline is not yet over! Even before all the drops, I showed orders on Coinbase around $1,800. 

The targets for Ethereum are $1,800-$2,150, from where it makes sense to look for entry points to buy Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet, zkSync, and other altcoins. I think the sideways accumulation might last about a month.



 Thoughts on the film: 

üé¨ Ethereum ‚Äî On July 23, the trailer for the documentary "Vitalik: An Ethereum Story" about Vitalik Buterin will be released.

The film has been in the works for over 3 years. The theatrical release is scheduled for fall 2024, and the biography will appear on streaming platforms in winter. 

‚ûñ It's fascinating how everything is unfolding: the final decision on the Ethereum ETF for BlackRock is on August 7, the documentary about Vitalik Buterin is coming out ü§†ü§†ü§†, and all major projects are postponing their listings to October 2024. 

‚ûñ It seems that the big exchanges and market makers have given the signal that it's too early to list; first, they need to pump the market up. 

‚ûñ Expect further cryptocurrency declines in July, and start looking for entry points into Ethereum at prices between $1,800-$2,150. During the same period, look for entry points into Ethereum's L2 solutions, namely Arbitrum, Optimism, Starknet, and zkSync.

This is my ETH roadmap for this week.
ETH still looks weaker in comparison to BTC.

Btw, market can continue down now from this level (current price) or little bit up then continue down.
The pont is, we can start take a short position now or wait at the next resistance.

Alwaya dyor before you take a position and make a decision.
Whatever your position always use stop loss
___
Hello everyone, I invite you to review the chart of ETH versus USDT, taking into account the one-day time frame. As you can see, the price has risen from the first channel of the downward trend, marked with blue lines, but currently we are staying just at the lower border of the lateral trend channel, marked with purple lines.

Currently, the price has bounced off the strong support zone which starts around $2,954 and ends at $2,681. A breakout from this zone could result in a price drop to around $2,000.

Looking the other way, you can see how the price remains ahead of a strong resistance zone from $3,083 to $3,253, going further you can determine the second zone from $3,531 to $3,732. If the price breaks higher from these two zones, there is still strong resistance at $3,977.

On the RSI indicator, we can see that we are bouncing just before the lower limit, which may potentially result in further upward movement, but it is worth monitoring the behavior of BTC to see if the current panic will deepen market corrections again.

üìÖToday, we're diving into the analysis of Ethereum (ETH) in both weekly and daily timeframes, alongside our usual analysis of Bitcoin (BTC). Let's kick things off with a detailed look at Bitcoin in the 1-hour timeframe.


üëë Bitcoin Analysis
üîç 1-Hour Timeframe Technical Analysis
After a prolonged bearish wave, Bitcoin hit support at 53921 and entered a correction phase. Currently, it is breaking through the 0.382 Fibonacci level, which significantly supports the bearish trend as the volume of green candles is much lower than the red ones from the previous days. This indicates volume and trend convergence, confirming the trend's health. The next correction levels are 58516 and 59550. Upon reaching and confirming these levels, short positions can be considered.

üìà Long Position Strategy
For long positions, I will hold off until the price stabilizes above the 99-day Simple Moving Average (SMA99). Once the price secures this level, I will announce the entry point for a long position.

üìâ Short Position Strategy
For short positions, you can utilize the levels of 58516 and 59550 during market corrections. If the market declines or you miss these two levels, you can open positions upon breaking 56045 or 53921. The levels mentioned for corrections are reactive, and since we adopt a breakout strategy, we must wait for the price to range at these levels. With a break below the range's floor and increasing sell volume, you can enter the position. The RSI trigger for confirming momentum entry is 44.10.

üí∞ Ethereum Analysis
üóÇ Project Overview
Ethereum is a blockchain-based project and one of the best in the crypto space, particularly for those interested in DeFi. Besides its native coin and blockchain, Ethereum also supports Layer 2 (L2) blockchains like Arbitrum, zkSync, Optimism (OP), Base, Linea, and Mode, which help manage transactions to reduce the load on the main blockchain, optimizing transaction fees and speeds.

Ethereum's transaction fees have significantly decreased following the Shanghai and Dencun updates, dropping from 60-70 Gwei to 2-9 Gwei, attracting more users to the blockchain. Various earning methods exist on the Ethereum network. The primary method is staking 32 ETH to become an Ethereum node, which ensures network security and earns fees from network transactions and block creation. Other methods include creating Liquidity Pool Tokens (LP tokens) on DEXs and earning fees from trades and swaps or engaging in lending and borrowing, which is a vast field in itself.

üîç Weekly Timeframe Technical Analysis
In the weekly timeframe, Ethereum began an upward move from the 1550$ area, continuing up to 4100$, then faced resistance at 3876$ and started to correct. It has now formed a double top pattern, which hasn't activated yet. Remember, a pattern holds no significance until it activates. So, we disregard this pattern unless the price stabilizes below 2914. If that happens, we can say the pattern is activated, and the price could move downward.

The critical point now is that the curved trendline is broken, the strong bullish momentum in the market has faded, and the price has been stabilizing below the 25-day SMA. Additionally, the 51.51 support in RSI is broken, potentially pushing the price down.

üìà Bullish Scenarios
We have a few scenarios for bullish movements. First, the price doesn't stabilize below 2914, gets supported, and starts creating higher highs. Second, a further correction to the 24709 support, a significant support level for Ethereum, might prevent further price drops. Third, reaching the double top target of 2188, which is the last stronghold for Ethereum's bullish trend.



üõí Spot Trading Strategy
For spot trading, it‚Äôs better to move to the daily timeframe for clearer charts. In this timeframe, a bearish momentum has caused the price to drop from 3919 to 2883, and it‚Äôs currently resting. If the price ranges adequately and forms a suitable structure for buying, you can enter upon breaking its range box. If it doesn't range and moves directly upward, our trigger is breaking the main resistance at 3919 unless we buy according to Dow Theory rules. Upon breaking 2883, the first support is 2620, and the second is 2188.

üìä Volume Analysis
The significant volume of red candles suggests a probable break of 2883, but since yesterday‚Äôs candle was a selloff, and today and tomorrow are holidays, the price might range for a few days before selling volume re-enters the market.

üîî Entry Points
Regarding the entry points mentioned, don't place orders in advance. Wait for the price to react to these levels and form a range structure. After buy volume enters and breaks the range box, you can proceed with your purchase.

üìù Conclusion
In conclusion, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are at critical levels, with Bitcoin showing bearish tendencies and Ethereum facing significant support challenges. It's crucial to wait for confirmation signals and volume trends before entering any positions.

üß†üíº Always remember the inherent risks in futures trading, with the potential for margin calls if risk management is neglected. Stick to strict capital management principles and use stop-loss orders, ensuring an initial target with a risk-to-reward ratio of 2.

In my analysis of the ETH/USDT daily chart, I've identified several critical elements that define the current state and possible future direction of Ethereum‚Äôs price action.

Technical Analysis Observations:

Chart Patterns and Key Levels:

Triangle Pattern: The price has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which generally indicates a period of indecision among traders. The apex of this pattern is approaching, suggesting that a breakout is imminent.
Support (S1 and S2):
S1 at $2,112.62: This level is crucial as it represents the lower boundary of the triangle. A break below could signal a significant bearish movement.
S2 at $2,500.00: This round number has psychological importance and may act as a minor psychological support if S1 breaks.
Resistance (R1 and R2):
R1 at $2,837.73: This is the upper boundary of the triangle. A breakout above could indicate bullish momentum.
R2 at $4,134.34: This represents a historical high and a long-term target in a bullish breakout scenario.
Indicators:

RSI (Relative Strength Index): Currently at 25.93, the RSI is deep in the oversold territory, suggesting that the market could be underpricing ETH, which may lead to a potential rebound or at least a stabilization of prices.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD is below the signal line and the histogram indicates increasing bearish momentum. This could signify that despite the oversold condition, the market might still see further declines.
Conclusion:
The ETH/USDT pair is at a critical juncture with its price consolidating within a triangle pattern. The proximity of the RSI to oversold levels hints at a possible upward correction, especially if it coincides with a breakout above the triangle's upper trend line (R1). However, the bearish bias indicated by the MACD suggests that any bullish moves could be short-lived unless there is a significant shift in market sentiment or external market drivers.

Given the current setup, my approach would be to watch for a clear breakout of the triangle pattern, accompanied by an increase in volume, which would provide a more reliable signal for either a long or short position. A break above R1 could target R2, while a breakdown below S1 might test the $2,500 psychological level before moving to deeper supports. As always, setting appropriate stop losses and taking profit levels is crucial to manage risk in such volatile conditions.

Ethereum  surged over 30% in anticipation of its much-awaited ETF approval, but the excitement may be short-lived. As traders who missed the initial rally eye the $2.9k to $3.2k support zone, a pullback seems likely. With ETH currently trading around $3.8k, a short trade to this support area presents an attractive opportunity.

 Technical Analysis: 

 
 Visible Range Volume Profile (VRVP):  The VRVP indicates a significant volume zone at $3k, suggesting strong support at this level.
 Average Directional Index (ADX):  The ADX, a momentum indicator, is losing strength, signaling a weakening trend.
 

 Proposed Short Trade: 

Entry Price: 3.8k zone USDT
Take Profit: 3k zone USDT
Stop Loss: 4.110 USDT

 Rationale: 

 
 The post-ETF approval euphoria is likely to fade, leading to a price correction.
 The $2.9k to $3.2k zone represents a strong support area, as evidenced by the VRVP.
 The weakening ADX suggests a loss of momentum in the uptrend.
 

Risk-to-Reward Ratio:

The potential risk-to-reward ratio for this trade is approximately 3:1, implying a potential 3% profit for every 1% risk.

As price goes down we still can see possible channel pattern but we must hold around 2.600-2.800 to keep it valid.

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  has been trading within a big range on the daily chart, oscillating between 2800 and 4000. The market has recently dipped to the lower boundary of the range and it is heading towards the channel's border. A box has formed on the left side, and I believe the market may break below this box to absorb liquidity and potentially stage a rally towards the top of the range zone. I'm expecting a test of the trendline and channel followed by a bullish move if the price makes fake breakout.  My goal is a resistance zone around 3365.00

Purpose: 
1.	To aid you in determining a TP target for short positions.
2.	Avoid loss by entering a long position prematurely.
3.	To point out a possible buyback Zone
 Description: 
Ethereum formed an M pattern. 
This pattern satisfies the initial requirements of a Bullish Bat Formation, which are as follows:
1.	Mandatory 50% B-point retracement of the XA leg.
2.	The C-point should be in the 50 ‚Äì 61.8% range.
 Target: 
1. The minimum target of a bat formation is the 1.272 extension of the BC leg. The 1.272 extension is at  2,276  USDT. 
The Price Reversal Zone is typically between the 1.618 extension of the BC leg and the 0.887 retracement of the XA leg. This range of  1786-1825  gives us a tight PRZ, which provides us with clear invalidation and a low-risk entry. 

God willing, I will update this idea as the PA unfolds in the coming days and weeks. 
Best Wishes

The price of Ethereum (ETH) experienced a significant decline today, breaching the previously strong support zone at  $2,850 . This price movement indicates a potential shift in the market sentiment.

Traders are now closely watching the next support level at  $2,250 . This zone is considered historically significant and could offer some stability to the price. However, if the selling pressure persists and ETH breaks below $2,250, the next potential support level to watch would be around  $2,000 .

It's crucial to exercise caution while trading in such volatile market conditions. While there might be opportunities for profit, the risks are equally substantial. Consider using Low Leverage & Stop Loss to manage risk effectively during this period of uncertainty.

All things are coming to plan for Q3, I believe q3 & q4 will be very bullish for us.

Reason being is because in Q2, myself and "others" thought we would just rip, and yes me being a victim to this I thought the same. The reason why it made sense for Q2 failing us to rip to 100k for BTC and new ATH is because, we had to take our timeee. We need to enjoy the patience of it as well I.E : The chart is telling us that it is creating a massive Cup and Handle formation, yes we were sideways for quite some time but that is apart of the game, it doesn't mean that we still can't make money when it goes sideways, Understand RANGE's.

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà  ETH has been overall bullish,  trading above the rising trendline marked in blue.

Currently, ETH is undergoing a correction phase and approaching the lower orange and blue trendlines.

Moreover, it is retesting a strong support and demand zone marked in green.

üèπ Thus, the highlighted blue circle is a strong area to look for trend-following buy setups as it is the intersection of the green support zone and blue/orange trendlines acting as non-horizontal support.

 üìö As per my trading style: 
As #ETH is around the blue circle zone, I will be looking for bullish reversal setups (like a double bottom pattern, trendline break , and so on...)

 üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

The pump auxiliary indicator moves in the opposite direction to the price.
There is a 0-line as a middle reference line, so when it starts to decline above the reference line, the price tends to rise for a long time, and when it is below the reference line, the GOOD signal does not appear, so there is no following of the rise and trading.

ETH is at the edge of the supporting trendline at $3200. A breakdown below this level will drop the price of ETH below $3k, reaching as low as $2500 to $2800.

On the brighter side, we have the 200 EMA acting as support for ETH, and a rebound from this green line could help ETH rally to the resistance level at $3800.

For now, ETH must hold the 200 EMA on this daily timeframe.

Do your own research before investing.

Considering the overlap in the 30-minute and 4-hour time frames indicating a supply zone on the chart, and viewing the recent price increase as a means of accumulating higher funds, surpassing the 3500 range still requires a significant jump in the overall market cap trend. Ethereum has managed to maintain its position due to its utility despite the severe market downturn. However, it‚Äôs important to note that surpassing the 3500 range necessitates a rise in Bitcoin to alleviate market fear. News regarding Ethereum ETFs could also be another exciting factor that has helped align the price with the market's upward trend. However, since the exact timing has been delayed, in my opinion, this jump is merely about collecting orders placed at higher points, and Ethereum still has the potential to decline until it reaches the 3650 mark.

There's been lots and lots of whale money-movements on the Ethereum side... I see the news and read about Vitalik that wants to speed up transactions; withdrawal signal?

A minor bounce occurred recently which is 100% unsupported by volume. No volume which means no strength which means that the bearish bias remains intact.

-------------------------------------

The StochRSI < 80, StochRSI > 20, OBV, -100, +100, RSI < 70, RSI > 30 indicators included in the HA-MS indicator are indicators that express the formulas of each basic indicator by modifying them.

These indicators can be intuitively confirmed by expressing each indicator on a price candle, and can be used as support and resistance points for detailed trading strategies.

-
(1M chart)

The most frequently referenced RSI indicators have been added to be drawn on price candles as RSI < 70, RSI > 30 indicators.

Therefore, if the price is maintained above the 3014.05 point, it can be interpreted that the RSI indicator is in the overbought zone.

Therefore, the 3014.05 point corresponds to the support and resistance zone.

-
The +100, -100 indicators are indicators that express the CCI indicator.

The CCI indicator interprets the -100 to +100 range as a sideways range based on the 0 point.

If it rises above +100, it is interpreted that it has escaped the sideways range and formed an upward trend.

If it falls below -100, it is interpreted that it has formed a downward trend.

Therefore, if it rises above the 3762.29 point, it should be interpreted that it is highly likely to form an upward trend.

Therefore, if it rises above the +100 indicator point, you can conduct a breakout trade.

-

If you understand the concept of the above indicators, I think you can create a trading strategy with just these indicators.

-
The HA-High indicator is formed at the 3321.30 point, so the most basic standard is the 3321.30 point.

Therefore, you should set the 3321.30 point as the standard and use the support and resistance points of the above indicators to create a trading strategy that suits you.

The trading strategy may vary depending on your investment period, investment amount, average purchase price, etc.

Even so, the HA-High and HA-Low indicators can be the standard for the chart, so you should consider the location of these indicators.

-
(1W chart)

It is currently continuing to rise within the rising channel.

Therefore, the key is whether it can rise along the rising channel.

-
The 3265.0 point and the 3321.30 point are the HA-High indicator points of the 1W and 1M charts.

Therefore, the area around the 3265.0-3321.30 section can be seen as the standard for trading.

Therefore, if it falls below the 3265.0-3321.30 section, it is highly likely that it will fall further.

However, the 3014.05 point is the RSI < 70 indicator point of the 1M chart, so if the price is maintained above 3014.05, it is likely that it will continue to rise in the long term.

Therefore, if it falls below the 3265.0-3321.30 section, it is necessary to check whether there is support in the 3014.05-3136.41 section.

-
(1D chart)

Currently, the HA-High indicator of the 1D chart is formed at 3787.59.

Therefore, in order for a full-scale uptrend to begin, the price must be maintained above 3787.59.

-
The +100 indicator is formed at 3523.09.

Therefore, in the short term, it is highly likely that an uptrend will be formed if it rises above 3523.09.

If not, the movement is likely to continue in the sideways section of the CCI indicator.

-
As above, you should look at the charts in order of 1M, 1W, and 1D charts, interpret them comprehensively, and create and modify your trading strategy by considering your average purchase price or investment period.

Again, among the indicators on this chart, the most basic indicators for trading are the HA-High and HA-Low indicators.

To find out the basic trend, you can check the movement of the MS-Signal indicator.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  continues the phase of correction, the character of which is consolidation. The goal is to gather potential before possible growth on the trend. The target is 4000-4800



The main focus is on ETH-ETF, which, according to rumors, may be allowed to trade on July 2-4. This will be another positive signal for the cryptocurrency community, as this fact may expand the underlying demand for cryptocurrencies and attract additional capital. 
Fundamentally, ETH is seeing an increase in the number of active wallets, traders are actively buying call options with strike 4000 and expiration in September, Ethereum Foundation is not selling ETH now as it usually did close to market tops, which together gives positive signs. 
The asset price is in a downward correction at the moment. The essence of this movement is the asset's consolidation before further strengthening. 

 Resistance levels: descending wedge line, 3678, 0.5 fibo
Support levels: 3200, trend line, 0.79 fibo 

Technically, liquidation of buyers in the liquidity area formed behind the trend support is possible, long-squeeze may lead to a rally.

Hey everyone!

If you're enjoying this analysis, a thumbs up and follow would be greatly appreciated!

ETH is trading above the $3300 level which is quite a strong support. As you see in the chart, it is forming a bull flag-like structure in an 8-hour time frame and is currently, trading inside it. Once it breaks out from the bull flag we might see a good 30-40% rally to the upside. 

Also, there is positive news that the SEC could approve spot Ethereum ETFs by July 4 so this definitely gives a good boost to ETH and Alts. 

Entry range:- $3280-$3380
Targets:- $3900/$4200/$4600
Invalidation:- Close below $3250

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà  ETH has been bearish  trading within the falling channel pattern marked in orange.

Currently, ETH is approaching the lower bound of the channel.

Moreover, it is retesting a strong demand zone $3,100 - $3,200.

üèπ Thus, the highlighted blue circle is a strong area to look for buy setups as it is the intersection of the green demand zone and lower orange trendline acting as a non-horizontal support.

 üìö As per my trading style: 
As #ETH approaches the blue circle zone, I will be looking for bullish reversal setups (like a double bottom pattern, trendline break , and so on...)

Ethereum is currently testing a support level. It is crucial that this support holds to maintain the bullish outlook.

Ethereum was unable to surpass the significant resistance level of $3,480. Breaking through this level could have initiated an upward trend for Ethereum.

However, due to a decrease in liquidity and an increase in the dominance of USDT, we currently expect a correction down to the $3,360 range. If this strong support level is decisively broken, we may reach lower support zones.

I think we'll have to wait until August before we start to see some growth. If we try to roughly estimate how many days the fall of all cryptocurrencies might last, we should remember that in August, the Ethereum ETF from Blackrock and Fidelity will be approved.

Hello everyone, here's a quick review of the situation on ETH in pair with USDT on a one-day time frame.  as you can see, we are moving in a triangle.    

To determine support zones, we will use the Fib Retracement grid, thanks to which we have a visible zone from $3,254 to $3,056, but when the price breaks out of it, we still have support at $2,819.     

looking the other way, we will define the resistances in a similar way and here we can see the first resistance at the price of $3,526, then the second one at $3,695, and then we have a strong resistance zone from $3,814 to $3,972.

For my plan to be the foundation of a trade means, it bears all the fruits of a single trade.

Market Context:
ETH has shown strong performance against BTC, attempting to break a significant monthly downtrend on the ETH/BTC chart. This potential breakout could lead to a substantial bullish move for ETH. Against USD, ETH is at a major resistance band around $3,500. A break above this level could attract more bullish interest. Key support levels to watch for ETH are $3,380, $3,330, and $3,250.

Trade Setup:

Entry: Enter a trade at the current resistance band around $3,500 or on a pullback to key support levels ($3,380, $3,330, and $3,250) if the resistance breaks.
Take Profit: Set profit targets at $3,700, $4,100, and $4,350.
Stop Loss: Place the stop loss just below the key support at $3,250 to manage potential downside risk.

As seen on the chart, ETH has been trading alongside two strong bullish supports over the course of the last two years. 

Personally, I'm waiting for a better entry before considering a near-term long swing entry, trade is on the chart.

These supports have historically held strong, so chances are that they will continue to do so. Keeping the TP close to reduce risk.

A riskier bet would be to put the TP at 5.000, higher risk and also higher reward.

Dear Traders,

Hope you are doing great, price mitigated earlier than what we had planned, now it currently trading at around the bearish trendline, although, price has rejected twice at the trendline. We still expect price to breakthrough and continue the bullish momentum towards $4500. Many things to notice here if price do not breakthrough and decide to drop further then it will like to drop below previous low which will directly take out the sell side liquidity. We need to monitor the price as it progress, if it does breakthrough the region then we will have a strong chance of buying swing.

The ETH chart shows recurring patterns: periods of strong growth (green circles) followed by consolidation (yellow and orange circles). After breaking the descending trend line, the price indicates a shift to a bullish sentiment. A short-term consolidation is expected, followed by a strong bullish move. Bullish momentum, supported by MACD and volume indicators, will lead to the target price of $4800. The BBO-Faust indicator also suggests potential for growth. ETH should overcome intermediate resistance levels and reach the final target price.

Ethereum has a similar pattern to Bitcoin, with 2 fakeout zones formed near the local ATH zone (within our timeframe).

With that being said, Ethereum is also testing the 100EMA and looking to fully secure it before moving back to testing the 200EMA. 

We are waiting for a breakdown and a movement to 200 EMA (potentially breaking it as well).

My point of view on ETH currently price is pushing up.
___
Ascending Channel: 

The chart shows Ethereum moving within an ascending channel, which generally indicates a bullish trend. The price recently broke below the ascending channel, suggesting a potential correction.

 Support and Resistance Levels: 

Support levels are identified around 3,300 and 3,200 USDT.
Resistance levels are around 3,400 and 3,600 USDT.

 Indicators: 

VMC Cipher B Divergences: Mixed signals with some bearish and bullish divergences. The current state suggests a bearish divergence.
RSI (Relative Strength Index): Currently at 49.51, indicating a neutral position. No clear overbought or oversold condition.
Stochastic RSI: Shows an oversold condition with a value of 17.22, which might indicate a potential buying opportunity soon.

 Trading Plan: 

 Intraday Trading: 
Entry: Look for long positions if the price shows a strong support bounce around 3,300 USDT.
Exit: Target the first resistance level around 3,400 USDT.
Stop Loss: Place a stop loss slightly below the support level at 3,280 USDT.
Strategy: Monitor shorter time frames (e.g., 15-minute chart) for bullish candlestick patterns or momentum indicators turning positive before entering.

 Scalping: 
Entry: Enter long positions at support levels identified on the 5-minute chart, especially if there is a double bottom or strong reversal pattern.
Exit: Quick profits at minor resistance levels or key moving averages on the same chart.
Stop Loss: Tight stop loss just below the immediate support levels, such as 3,290 USDT.
Strategy: Use high-frequency trades to capitalize on small price movements, considering both support and resistance levels.

 Swing Trading: 
Entry: Consider entering long positions if the price bounces from 3,300 USDT support level, confirming a reversal.
Exit: Aim for the resistance level around 3,600 USDT.
Stop Loss: Place a stop loss around 3,200 USDT to protect against deeper corrections.
Strategy: Hold the position for a few days to a week, allowing the trade to develop. Use the daily chart to identify entry and exit points.

My advice:

Long Position: Favor long positions at current levels, given the oversold conditions on the Stochastic RSI and the presence of support around 3,300 USDT. Watch for a confirmed reversal signal before entering.

Short Position: Consider short positions if the price fails to hold the 3,300 USDT level and breaks lower, aiming for the next support at 3,200 USDT.

Risk Management: Always use stop losses to manage risk and protect capital. Adjust stop loss levels according to the volatility and trade timeframe.
Overall, the current technical setup suggests a cautious long bias, waiting for confirmation of support holding and potential reversal signals before entering trades.

Daily Timeframe Analysis:
The price formed a sideways movement on the daily timeframe starting in February 2024. The buyer's vector 8-9 reached its mandatory target, and now the seller's vector 9-10 is relevant with a potential target of 3301.9 (the upper boundary of the buyer's zone, which was formed at the base of vector 8-9, indicated by the blue rectangle on the chart). The seller initiated their vector and formed a seller's zone at the beginning of the vector (red rectangle on the chart, lower boundary at 3624.28).

Sales Strategy:
Sales can be considered as an idea of realizing the seller's vector 9-10 from the seller's defense of the level 3659.01, which is a test of the buyer within the formed seller's zone. The potential target is 3301.9. On the hourly timeframe, the level 3659.01 serves as the seller's defense level for the breakout from the sideways movement. So on this timeframe, you can look for signs of the seller defending the level. If the seller does not defend this level, there is a high probability that the buyer will reach 4000.

Purchases Strategy:
Purchases are advisable to consider after the price interacts with the buyer's zone at the base of vector 8-9 (blue rectangle on the chart, upper boundary at 3301.9).
___
Hi traders and investors! 

The seller's vector 9-10 reached its mandatory target in the sideways range on the daily TF from the previous review. It's time to update the possible scenarios.

 Daily Timeframe Analysis 
On the daily timeframe, the price has formed a sideways range that began in February 2024. The seller's vector 9-10 reached its mandatory target with a low of 3240, and now the buyer's vector 10-11 is relevant with a potential target of 3977. The first obstacle for the buyer is the high of the last seller's bar at 3435. The price has not yet interacted with this level. Since the price is at the lower boundary of the sideways range on the daily timeframe, it makes sense to start looking for buying opportunities. Let's look at the lower timeframe.

 Hourly Timeframe Analysis 
On the hourly timeframe, the price has formed a sideways range. The seller's vector 4-5 exited the boundary of the range, and then the buyer absorbed the attacking range boundary candle of the seller, forming a buyer's zone at the end of the seller's vector (blue rectangle on the chart). Currently, the buyer's vector 5-6 is relevant with a potential target of 3653. The price is at the lower boundary of the sideways range on the hourly timeframe, so it makes sense to start looking for buying opportunities.

 Buying opportunities 
Buying opportunities can be sought from the idea of realizing the buyer's vector 10-11 in the sideways range on the daily timeframe or from the idea of realizing the buyer's vector 5-6 in the sideways range on the hourly timeframe.
From the protection by the buyer of the lower boundary of the sideways range at 3362 on the hourly timeframe.
 
 From the protection by the buyer of the level 3345, which is the test of the seller of the formed buyer's zone at the end of the seller's vector 4-5 on the hourly timeframe.
 From the protection by the buyer of the level 3240, which is the test of the seller of the formed buyer's zone at the base of the buyer's vector 8-9 on the daily timeframe.
 After the buyer absorbs the daily candle of June 24, 2024 on the daily timeframe (conservative strategy).

Comparing the BTC and ETH charts after ETF approval:

Following Bitcoin ETF approval, the price initially dropped in a classic "buy the rumor, sell the news" scenario. However, after ETF trading began and inflows increased, the price pumped. 
We're seeing a similar pattern with Ethereum. After the recent ETF approval, the price dipped, but a correction might already be underway. With Ethereum ETF trading expected to start on July 2nd, potential inflows could propel the price upwards.

ETH Fibonacci trend line, the main targets are 0.618, 0.5 and 0.382. Focus on the white trend line. It is the bottom only when it falls to the white line, otherwise it is the top. It will take a long time for the trend-level market price to see the final effect.
___
ETH Should Begin a bigger bearish wave

From the previous analysis, the price reached the first downside target twice.

ETH is creating one bear structure after another thus increasing the chances of a bigger correction.

Over the next few days, we should move ETH to other targets:
3280; 3065 and 2900

(ETHUSDT 1M chart)

The key is whether it can receive support near the Fibonacci ratio point of 0.618 (3548.07) and rise above the upper point of the HA-High indicator box on the 1M chart.

If the price is maintained above the HA-High indicator, I think there is a high possibility of a full-fledged upward trend.

Therefore, it is expected that a full-fledged upward trend will begin only when the price is maintained above the 3321.30 point, which is the HA-High indicator point on the 1M chart.


If not, and it falls, you should check for support around 0.382 (2647.80).


(1W chart)

It has touched the psychological volume profile zone and is rising.

The key is whether it can receive support in the 3503.68-3730.71 range and rise above 4093.92.


If not, and it falls, you should check for support around 3025.27-3321.30.


If the price maintains above 4093.92, it is expected to rise to around 4868.0.


(1D chart)

It should rise to the HA-High indicator box section (3570.0-4010.98) on the 1D chart.

Accordingly, the key is whether it can receive support around 3570.0 and rise above 3903.61-4010.98.

If the price is maintained above 3903.61-4010.98, a full-fledged upward trend is expected to begin.


The 3025.27-3321.30 section is the HA-High indicator section of the 1M and 1W charts, so it is an important section.

Since the price broke above this important zone with a sharp increase, if the price holds above 3025.27-3321.30, it is expected to renew the latest previous high.

---------------------------------------------

(1D chart)

Please refer to the HA-Low and HA-High indicators used to initiate trading and the BW indicator to verify them.


We need to check if we can receive support around the current secondary range, that is, the 3570.0-3730.71 range.


If you were unable to buy around 2817.0-3025.27, I think it would be a good idea to check for support in the 3903.61-4093.92 range and proceed with buying.

The reason is that the HA-High indicator was created and a high point was formed.

Therefore, the HA-High indicator point at 3903.61 can become a resistance point.


From a day trading perspective, if support is confirmed around 3570.0, you can buy and sell around 3903.61.



Have a good time.
thank you

--------------------------------------------------

- The big picture

The full-fledged upward trend is expected to begin when the price rises above 29K.

This is the section expected to be touched in the next bull market, 81K-95K.


#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (when overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (when overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points that are likely to encounter resistance in the future.
We need to see if we can break through these points upward.

Since it is thought that a new trend can be created in the overshooting zone, you should check the movement when this zone is touched.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the general upward trend continues until 2025, it is expected to rise to around 57014.33 and then create a pull back pattern.
1st: 43833.05
2nd: 32992.55

üí∞  Welcome to Your Channel! 
Welcome to our channel where we delve into the intricacies of financial markets. Today, we focus on  ETH/USDT,  dissecting its current price action to uncover strategic trading opportunities. Join us as we analyze key levels and market dynamics, aiming to refine our trading strategies and maximize potential gains.

üìà  Smart Money Technique (SMT)  
As we discussed the  SMT  (Smart Money Technique) in our previous analysis of the Bitcoin chart, let's delve deeper into SMT for a better understanding. Currently, we not only observe SMT but also identify a Fair Value Gap ( FVG ) that is supporting the price.

üîÑ ETH and BTC Correlation
In the context of cryptocurrencies, specifically Ethereum ( ETH ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ), correlation plays a significant role in market analysis. Historically, ETH and BTC have exhibited a strong positive correlation, meaning they often move in the same direction. When BTC's price rises, ETH's price typically follows, and vice versa.

üìä Current Market Phase: Accumulation
Right now, both Ethereum and Bitcoin are in an accumulation phase. We can anticipate a manipulation movement to the downside before initiating a bullish movement, targeting buy-side liquidities (BSL) such as the Equal High ( EQH ) above the chart.

üìâ Potential Bearish Scenario
For any bearish scenario, we need to see buy-side liquidities taken out. Only then can we consider any bearish movement or the invalidation of  SMT . If this occurs, we will definitely discuss the implications in detail.

üôè Thank you for joining us!

Just opened an ETH long.

Based on analysis Bulls look like they're gaining strength against the bears.

Target $3605

Stop : $3500 or lower

3-4 RR trade.
___
Might still get eth short squeeze , see prior pin post. Invalidation was candle close below 3474 but it didn't happen. Thought I saw 30 min engulf with volume and that shifted my bias a bit o the downside consider we were already below support. 

Watching price a bit now with long ready just in case. Will update when I enter

2.5-3,4 RR setup
___
ETH/USD (Ethereum) price still holds on a $3,450-$3,500 support level. Waiting for a breakout like the last time. This bullish setup is invalid if this support won't hold the price. Then there is a huge probability of retesting the $2,920 support level. Be safe out there!
___
Prior eth long scenario got invalidated. Now I think the price will continue to trend lower after seeing strong selling pressure coming in and rejection of higher prices above 3500 area.

Daily,4hr,1hr and 30 min tf trending down.

Target is next main support at $3400 area.
___
Am waiting for Eth to correct a bit to $3500 psychological level then show signs of strong buying interest.

This will be a breakout of 1hr and 4hr trend back to the upside. Price already failed to make a new lower low and pushed up strongly with a strong engulfing candle with volume on the 1hr tf- that's potential new higher low.

Target is daily resistance area around $3560

 I expect a fast aggressive short squeeze breakout as many people have been shorting above near by resistance including the current correction high on 15 min tf,  a trigger of their stoploss will convert to instant buy orders providing fuel for price to slingshot higher into other near by stop and repeat the process until we reach potential sell wall at 3560 area where I expect price to correct again back down to $3515 area, taking out fomo longs while searching for new potential higher low.

There's also inverse head and shoulder confluence on the 1hr tf.

Setup invalidated if price close below  $3474
___
Ethereum(ETH)  has succeeded in breaking the  lower line of the Symmetrical Triangle .

According to the theory of  Elliott waves , Ethereum(ETH) seems to be completing  corrective wave s.

I expect  Ethereum(ETH)  to fall at least to the  Potential Reversal Zone(PRZ) .

 Note: An important point you should always remember is capital management and lack of greed.

Technical Analysis of Ethereum (ETH/USDT) 

 Chart Overview: 
The chart depicts the ETH/USDT price action on a 4-hour timeframe, showcasing a falling wedge pattern, which is generally considered a bullish reversal pattern. Here are the key observations:

Falling Wedge Pattern: 
The falling wedge is marked clearly, indicating a potential upward breakout. The pattern is confirmed by the higher lows and lower highs converging towards the apex.

Support and Resistance Levels:
Resistance Zones: $3,600 - $3,800 and $4,000.
Support Zones: $3,200 - $3,400.

Volume: The volume is relatively low but picking up near support zones, which is a typical characteristic before a breakout.

Indicators:
VMC Cipher B: Showing potential divergences with green dots indicating possible bullish momentum.

RSI (14): Currently at 42.06, suggesting the market is not overbought and has room to move up.

Stochastic RSI: Showing oversold conditions, which could indicate a buying opportunity as it crosses upwards.

 Trading Plan 
 Intraday Trading 
Strategy: Use support and resistance levels for quick trades.

Entry: Buy near the support zone ($3,200 - $3,400) when confirmed by bullish indicators (e.g., green dots on VMC Cipher B).

Target: Sell near the first resistance zone ($3,600 - $3,800).

Stop Loss: Place a stop loss below $3,200 to manage risk.

 Scalping 
Strategy: Take advantage of small price movements within the support and resistance zones.
Entry: Buy on minor pullbacks within the wedge near $3,300 - $3,400.
Target: Aim for small profits at $3,450 - $3,500.
Stop Loss: Place tight stop losses around $3,280 to minimize losses on quick trades.

 Swing Trading 
Strategy: Capitalize on the potential breakout from the falling wedge.
Entry: Buy once price breaks and retests the upper trendline of the wedge around $3,500 with confirmation from volume increase.
Target: First target at $3,800, with a potential move to $4,000.
Stop Loss: Place a stop loss below the retest level, around $3,400.
Conclusion and Advice
Given the technical indicators and the falling wedge pattern, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of a bullish reversal. Traders should consider the following:

Long Positions: Favorable for all trading strategies (intraday, scalping, and swing trading) as the pattern and indicators suggest an upward movement. Enter positions near support levels and on confirmed breakouts.
Short Positions: Not advisable at this stage unless there's a confirmed breakdown below the support zone of $3,200, which could invalidate the bullish pattern.

 Recommendation:  Based on the chart, a long position is recommended with careful attention to the support and resistance levels. Monitor the indicators for any shifts in momentum and adjust the trading strategy accordingly. Always use stop losses to manage risk effectively.
___
ETH mitigating orderblock (1) to moving downside. Order block (c) was failed. Because order block (c) was buyside orderblock. But Ethereum was bearish. So Buyside orderblock was not high probability. 

At the same time Ethereum break the uptrend channel downside. If Ethereum moving upside, mitigate orderblock (2) to moving downside. 

Order block (3) was buyside orderblock. But it was not high probability. Maybe some upside movements possible.
___
My point of view on ETH currently price doesn‚Äôt create a new high but resistance instead, so I expect ETH can go lower than currently low. #not Financial advice and good luck
___
CRYPTOCAP:ETH  still looks full bull to me on HTF. Hovering right above previous major resistance, which coincidentally is right at the pivot. 

5D chart here. Sill on bull side of RSI EQ and AO is inching closer and closer towards a full reset. 

We're eyeing at least $7k by November.
___
Note -
One of the best forms of Price Action is to not try to predict at all. Instead of that, ACT on the price. So, this chart tells at "where" to act in "what direction. Unless it triggers, like, let's say the candle doesn't break the level which says "Buy if it breaks", You should not buy at all.
=======
I use shorthands for my trades.
"Positional" - means You can carry these positions and I do not see sharp volatility ahead. (I tally upcoming events and many small kinds of stuff to my own tiny capacity.)
"Intraday" -means You must close this position at any cost by the end of the day.
"Theta" , "Bounce" , "3BB" or "Entropy" - My own systems.
=======
I won't personally follow any rules. If I "think" (It is never gut feel. It is always some reason.) the trade is wrong, I may take reverse trade. I may carry forward an intraday position. What is meant here - You shouldn't follow me because I may miss updating. You should follow the system I share.
=======
Like -
Always follow a stop loss.
In the case of Intraday trades, it is mostly the "Day's High".
In the case of Positional trades, it is mostly the previous swings.
I do not use Stop Loss most of the time. But I manage my risk with options as I do most of the trades using derivatives

Model Overview
This AI model is designed to predict the price of the cryptocurrency ETH/USDT based on historical data from multiple exchanges. The model utilizes machine learning technology, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, which are particularly well-suited for time series and sequence-based predictions.

2. Data Sources
The model draws data from two main exchanges:

Binance
Bybit
For each exchange, historical data is retrieved, including price (open, high, low, close) and trading volume. These basic data points are supplemented with technical indicators such as RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and Bollinger Bands, which help better understand market behavior.

3. Data Processing
Data is first normalized to have a consistent range, which facilitates the training of the neural network. Datasets and sequences are then created for training the model.

4. Model Structure
The model is composed of several layers:

Input Layer: Accepts sequences of data of 60 steps in length.
LSTM Layers: Three layers of LSTM neurons, each with 50 units, with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
Dense Layers: Two dense layers for final signal processing and generating predictions.
5. Training and Validation
The model is trained using cross-validation (k-fold cross-validation), which allows for more efficient training and validation of the model. Each fold splits the data into training and testing sets, improving the model‚Äôs accuracy and robustness.

6. Model Saving
After successful training, the model is saved for future use, significantly speeding up the prediction process.

7. Generating Predictions

ETH is showing signs of a potential breakout to the downside, presenting a short trade opportunity. The breakout trade setup indicates a possible downward movement in Ethereum's price, making it an attractive option for shorting. Traders may consider entering a short position in anticipation of a bearish price movement, aligning with the breakout pattern.

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders,

üì¶ After breaking below the $3650 structure, ETH has been bearish trading within the falling channel marked in orange.

üìà  For the bulls to regain control,  and push towards the $4000 mark, a break above the upper trendline and $3700 is needed.

üìâ  Meanwhile , ETH would be overall bearish and can still trade lower to test the lower orange trendline and $3,200 demand zone.

Which scenario is more likely to happen first, and why?

üìö  Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

ETH/USDT (Ethereum)

Sector: PoS Layer 1
Market Cap: $440B

ETH recently suffered a correction, as did the whole market, driven by Bitcoin.
This morning, however, we managed to break the downtrend line below which we had been stuck for over 15 days. We are currently retesting it.

If the rebound continues, the next resistance zone to watch will be around $3650, where we could be pushed back. If we manage to break through this level and turn it into a support, then we could go for the previous highs around $3900.

Although many people have turned bearish because due to boredom and sharp corrections on altcoins, Ethereum stands out thanks to the narrative regarding the approval of its  soon-to-be-launched ETFs. It's also worth noting that the SEC's charges against Ethereum were dropped yesterday!

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  may end the correction phase and move into the distribution phase, the target could be 4000-4800. Fundamentally, ethereum is receiving positive signals from regulators. 



The price is breaking the resistance of the local correction pattern. The coin is trying to go beyond the consolidation range (breaking the bearish wedge resistance). A break of the local high will be a confirmation that the correction is over and the market is ready to move on. 
Earlier ETH-ETF was approved, the next stage is confirmation of S-1 form (admission to trading), SEC is actively working with issuers, trading may start this summer.
Also, a positive sign of a strong market is the end of the SEC's judicial investigation against ConsenSys (Ethereum developer). Volumes are rising and like the price, traders are taking this fact positively. 

 Resistance levels: 3650, 3730
Support levels: 3585, 3480, 3400 

The price consolidation above 3650-3730 will confirm the end of the correction. Bulls in this case can take the situation into their own hands after a long accumulation, the target of which may be a test of high, as well as ath.

Regards R. Linda!

ETH still holding the  Inducement (üíé). But ETH showing some upside movements. 

Because ETH countinuesly mitigating orderblock (a, b) to moving upside. The next one is Order block (c). 

So ETH mitigate orderblock (c) to moving upside is possible. If order block (c) was fail, ETH moving downside. 

And order block (1) was sell side order block. So maybe mitigating this order block to moving downside is possible.

Ethereum has been struggling to breakout from the local resistance zone, where the price has formed a nice two-fakeout zone, which can also be seen as a double-top pattern. 

Now that we are looking for further movement below that resistance zone, we will be keeping an eye on the neckline zone, which we will touch once we see a full breakdown from that resistance zone!

The Ethereum daily timeframe chart shows significant technical levels. The local high is approximately $4,093, with a downward-trending resistance line indicating a bearish trend from this peak.

The initial support is around the $3,440 level, represented by a yellow dotted line. The main support is identified by a white upward trend line at $3,100.

Ethereum is currently trading around the $3,500 level. A break below this level could lead to further declines.

POV: ETH must hold the current support level; if not, be prepared for an 11% drop.

Do your own research before investing.

The expectation of the bullish head and shoulders structure also failed, so the long orders we made based on this expectation were triggered to stop loss. Although it has fallen below the low again, we are currently in the buying zone. I will not chase shorts in this zone.

Here is a potential scenario for ETH, this would retrace the whole ETF pump and make everyone super bearish, just what the market loves.

If this is a standard ABC wave 4 correction, we have completed 5 waves down, now 3 up since the ETF announcement, and a further 5 corrective waves could finish at the 1-1 FIB Extension, which is also the previous top as well as the bottom of the corrective channel and 2 untapped daily levels, around 2750-2700.

Our box didn't hold, we swept the previous low and are currently grinding down again.

The market is looking horrendous overall: we have 2 big spot buying twaps going on on BTC, while price keeps grinding down. Obviously that takes the entire market down as well, so it's impossible for ETH to catch a decent bid here.

Since it seems to react well off EMAs recently, I used these to give a general outlook about where we are and what 'working ranges' we might expect going forward.

I'm slowly positioning long on ETH through longer dated calls (from end of July through end of year). The expectation is to DCA in here and sell a big portion on the first big IV spike.

You can expect IV to go up into the event and come down after, so since I'm banking on IV to offset time decay and not really hoping on significantly higher prices, I need to be out before the actual event, because it reduces uncertainty and therefor should decrease implied volatility (IV), which has a big impact on options pricing.

ETH: The Bearish Wave Is Not Over Yet

From the previous analysis, the price reached the first downside target twice.

ETH is creating one bear structure after another thus increasing the chances of a bigger correction.

Ethereum almost got to the target zone I've marked 6 days ago. Missed by 21 dollar. But I'm yet cautious about bullish entries. Last 12H closed bearish, so I believe this chart will require another day or two to draw some certainty. Till then we may expect dips under 3427 and possibly to that zone I've marked as well.

Level at 3650 remains decisive for mid term direction. ETH got to find acceptance above it to go for new ATH.

ETH

Has some headline tailwinds so gonna be very picky about shorting this one going forward, except after news candles. No need to discuss whether ETF thing is bullish or not, it's more about not being stopped in the wick up caused by some Bloomberg fella's tweet; I'd rather enter there.

Longs are in the white box for me.

Again: bullish or not, I will simply not long something that's up +5% and is now putting a bunch of weekend longers underwater. (Price came down a bit while typing this, prices are more attractive here)

Sweep recent low and you technically have a div setup into D1 EMA 100.
I don't know if you really want that to happen if you're bullish on this though, but iirc ETH has done similar shenanigans in the past.

Lose that EMA and we're looking at the diagonal. Lose that and we're looking at hamster races for the next year or 2-3.

üìä#ETH correction phase may be over‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, we have successfully broken out of the downtrend line. If a bullish head and shoulders structure can be constructed near the buying zone, then there is a high probability that we will use this bullish structure as support to start rising, and we will have the opportunity to challenge the previous high. üìà

‚û°Ô∏èIn addition, breaking through the downward trend line is a positive signal for us, but the appearance of such a signal does not allow you to directly chase the rise. It is unreasonable for you to chase the rise without fully understanding my point of view.

ETH Bearish Breakout: A Confirmation to Further Declines?
 
Ethereum has recently emerged from a bearish pattern, signaling an increased likelihood of an extended downward trend. The initial pattern that triggered the bearish momentum began on June 7th. Following this, we observed another significant bearish wave as the price breached yet another structure zone yesterday.

This breakout has heightened the probability that Ethereum (ETH) may retest the 3420 level. Should this bearish pressure persist, there‚Äôs a potential for the price to descend further, possibly reaching as low as 3280.

Hello everyone, I invite you to review the chart of ETH in pair with USDT, on a four-hour interval. As we can see, the price has risen from the first channel of the downward trend, then we can see a break from the local upward trend line and now we can see the second channel of the downward trend,

Currently, the price has bounced off the support at $3,495, but remaining in the descending channel, we may see the price drop to the support at $3,179. Going further, we have a very strong support zone from $2,954 to $2,678.

Looking the other way, you can see how the price remains in front of a strong resistance zone from $3,645 to $3,814, then there is resistance at $4,098, and then we have a very strong resistance at $4,560.

Looking at the RSI indicator, you can see that we are entering the upper part of the range despite a slight price movement on the chart, while the STOCH indicator shows that we are exceeding the upper limit, which may still result in another attempt at price recovery.

Here we have an analysis for Ethereum in 1H time frame. we can consider two scenarios. 
Bullish Scenario:
If ETH breaks above the immediate resistance (PA) around $3,700, it could rally towards higher resistance levels at $3,900, $4,000, and potentially up to $4,400.
This is depicted by the black projected path, suggesting a continued uptrend.
Bearish Scenario:
If ETH fails to break the $3,700 resistance and moves below the immediate support of $3,520, it could see further declines.
The orange projected path indicates a potential drop towards $3,360, $3,280, and a significant support level around $3,125.
This scenario suggests a possible deeper correction before any potential recovery.

üìàüí∞  Welcome to Your Channel! 
Welcome to your very own channel! Here, we embark on a collaborative journey to analyze and scrutinize financial markets, aiming to achieve substantial profits together. Let's dive into the  Crypto market , focusing on one of its key assets:  ETH/USDT .

üìâüîç  Previous Week's Analysis and Bearish Trend 
In our previous analysis, we anticipated a reaction to the Fair Value Gap ( FVG ) followed by a continuation to the downside, which indeed occurred. The price moved down, taking out the previous low and reaching the Sell-Side Liquidity ( SSL ) marked out.

üìäüìâ  Formation and Respect of New Fair Value Gaps 
Subsequently, new Bearish Fair Value Gaps ( FVG ) were created, and the price respected these gaps, continuing its downward movement. Thus, the overall bias for the past week was bearish, as discussed.

üöÄüìà  Liquidity Sweep and Long Position Opportunity 
Before we delve into the significant Fair Value Gap (FVG) visible on the chart, it's important to note that Equal Lows ( EQL ) were formed. Following this, there was a liquidity sweep, and the price tapped into the  FVG . This provided an excellent opportunity for a long position on lower time frames.

üìàüí∞  Current Price Range and Anticipated Movements 
Regarding the current price range, we can anticipate a retracement lower, followed by a potential move higher. However,  we need further confirmation , as the price action is not as clear as it should be.

Hey everyone!

If you're enjoying this analysis, a thumbs up and follow would be greatly appreciated!

ETH is currently trading within a falling wedge pattern, which can be a bullish reversal signal. There's support around $3420-$3480, which could act as a springboard for a price increase.

Here's what we're watching:

 Breakout confirmation:  A clean break and close above the upper trendline of the wedge is crucial for a potential trend reversal.
 Upside potential:  If the breakout is confirmed, we could see a significant price increase. 

Invalidation:- 4hr candle close below $3400 level.

Very clean downtrend after half ct bought the top on this one.

We are frontrunning the D1 EMA 100 a little bit here, because the s/r flip was reacting very nicely.

Expectations are that we compress here between H4 EMAs and D1 EMA 100.

Sweeping into D1 EMA 100 is probably a good add, but I'd wait for a decent reaction and be ready to cut if things go south.

Tradfi and macro guys are starting to get uneasy here, and although we often meme that it's not relevant, it does become very relevant at big inflection points. BTC not being able to break that consolidation range and ETH struggling to make new highs, both on very good news, is not great for crypto in general.

Others have said it: there's a parallel to be seen with prices not going down in the 16k range, even though we had only bad news and things couldn't look uglier. At this point we have almost only good news and things rarely looked better for crypto, but price is.. not going up?

Just to set some basic expectations that we're playing longs here for a bounce, not for new highs; the base case is still that there is a higher probability we break to range to the downside vs. upside. Both are possible though, so just be flexible, identify levels of interest and be patient.

Good luck!

In this technical analysis of the Ethereum (ETH)/USDT daily chart on Binance, we are reviewing the primary technical indicators and price structures that might influence Ethereum's price movements in the near future.

Price Action and Support/Resistance Levels
The current price of ETH is approximately $3,042.48, showing a recent decline of about 1.93%. The chart identifies critical resistance (R1, R2, R3) and support levels (S1, S2, S3). The highest recent resistance is at $4,371.66, and support levels are situated at $3,293.19, $2,874.64, and $2,112.62. These levels are instrumental in determining potential turning points or consolidation zones in the market.

Technical Indicators
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD line below the signal line and a negative histogram suggest a bearish momentum is currently prevailing. The decreasing histogram height also indicates that the bearish momentum may be losing strength, which could mean a potential stabilization or reversal of the price movement soon.

RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI stands at approximately 55, indicating a neutral market condition. This level suggests that while the market is not in overbought or oversold territory, there is still room for either bullish or bearish developments depending on broader market cues.

Chart Patterns
The chart shows Ethereum in a descending channel pattern, indicating a potential continuation of the bearish trend if the upper boundary of the channel holds as resistance. The next key observation will be whether the price tests and respects the S1 support level, which could lead to a rebound towards R1.

Conclusion
Considering the present indicators and the price behavior within the descending channel, Ethereum appears to be navigating a bearish phase with the potential for testing further support levels, particularly if the current support at S1 fails to hold. The bearish MACD suggests caution, but the neutral RSI provides a slight buffer, indicating that not all bullish momentum is lost. Traders should watch for potential rebounds at major support levels or a break above the channel as signals for a trend reversal. As with any trading strategy in such volatile markets, setting stop losses and monitoring key resistance and support flips are advisable to manage risks effectively.
___
After the SEC approved ETH Spot ETFs, Ethereum was in a strong position, constantly trying to break its resistance of $4,000. It attempted to form a bullish flag, but as the US CPI and PPI data release approached, it plummeted more than 5%, following Bitcoin. The market panicked when ETH broke its support at $3,700 and then further broke $3,500, a crucial level. The bulls pulled it back above that range, allowing ETH to take interim support above $3,500. If the CPI and PPI data release is unfavorable, we might see ETH plummeting to and below $3,000. If the data is favorable, ETH will slowly climb back to its position to reclaim its all-time high.

In the 1-day time frame, oscillators are signaling a buy for ETH, while the moving averages are bearish. It is interesting to note that moving averages are giving a strong buy call in the weekly time frame, while oscillators remain neutral.

In the world of investing, it is not uncommon to come across a missed trade setup that tempts investors to make impulsive decisions. However, it is important to remain disciplined and avoid falling into the trap of #FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). For instance, if an investor misses a trade setup on Ethereum ( CRYPTOCAP:ETH ), instead of rushing in with a full position, a more prudent approach would be to enter with half the intended position. This allows the investor to participate in the trade while minimizing the risk of committing too much capital at once.

Once the initial entry is made, it is crucial to implement a strategy known as Dollar Cost Averaging (#DCA). This involves gradually increasing the position size by buying more ETH over time. By using DCA, investors can mitigate the impact of short-term market volatility and avoid making rash decisions based solely on emotions.

To effectively implement DCA, it is important to maintain the original stop loss level. This means that even if the price of ETH decreases after the initial entry, the stop loss order should remain at the predetermined level. By sticking to this plan, investors can ensure that their risk management strategy remains intact and that they do not expose themselves to unnecessary losses.

In summary, when faced with a missed trade setup on ETH, it is crucial to resist the urge to FOMO in with a full position. Instead, entering with half the intended position and utilizing Dollar Cost Averaging can provide a more measured and disciplined approach. By maintaining the original stop loss level throughout the process, investors can enhance their risk management and increase their chances of success in the long run.

Despite the overall uptrend on the daily timeframes, the 4H chart shows a more mixed picture, with the market moving sideways. However, a closer look at  BINANCE:ETHUSDT  price action reveals a more promising development. The price has formed a double bottom pattern, reaching the support level that was tested before. This has created a new range zone that breakout of it may lead to new highs. Given this setup, I expect the price to make an upward move and retest swap zone. My target is the resistance zone at 3700

ETH is currently holding the support zone, which indicates a positive trend. There may be some rally before the next move up. If you missed the entry earlier, open a long position in the support zone.

Ethereum in the upcoming weeks. It's very bullish

ETH new ATH soon!
___
Year VWAP VAH was at 3645 (same as March close) - ETH dipped below it and yesterday went up for bearish re-test, where it got rejected. That hugely increase chances for further retracement towards breakout level around 3260-3340 at least.

Year VWAP is around 3123 and act as high timeframe magnet for the price. By the time ETH gets to it, most probably it will rise higher and meet the zone I've mentioned above.

ETH ETF will be approved by the end of this summer, so long term I stay bullish. The only question, is where to buy. Zone of interest for me starts under 3400 and I will monitor price action there to catch that bottom (after lower timeframe confirmation of course).

Dear Traders,

Hope you are doing great, our previous analysis on ETH, where we had pointed out of potential reversal in price action. Price had created AB=CD pattern and after completion price moved as we had expected. However, due to extreme bullish buy volume that emerged in the market, price left fair value gap. We anticipating price to drop to the region to fill the area and continue the bullish momentum towards $4450.

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

üìà ETH has been overall bullish,  trading above the rising trendline marked in blue.

After rejecting the $4,000 - $4,100 resistance zone, ETH is undergoing a correction phase and it is currently hovering around the $3,500 round number.

If the $3,500 is broken downward, a deeper bearish correction towards the $3,100 demand zone would be expected.

üèπ The highlighted blue circle is a strong area to look for trend-following buy setups as it is the intersection of the green demand zone and blue trendline acting as a non-horizontal support.

 üìö As per my trading style: 
As ETH approaches the blue circle zone, I will be looking for bullish reversal setups (like a double bottom pattern, trendline break , and so on...)

üìö  Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

Moreover, a higher low was printed prior to the break of previous lower high and subsequently higher high.

Today we have a sudden strong bullish move that is completely fake and unsustainable... Join me in this trade idea so that we can look at Ethereum together; Boost, so that we can get started.

Today's candle shows the strongest bullish action for Ethereum since early 2021; major bull-market action. That's the type of action we are seeing today.

This type of action at this point in time is not positive and is not sustainable... This type of action will lead to a massive, massive crash.

My prediction is that this move will either end today, going bearish tomorrow, or least 1-2 additional days and no more than that.

The action will lead to a lower high and then a major crash.

We will get retraces and new lows between June/July and the recovery in the ensuing months. Before the end of the year we should be looking great.

That's my prediction.

I can be wrong... But we let the market take care of the rest.

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.

ETH is at $3,616.49 has struggled to sustain its position above the $3,669.57 support, showing that demand is declining at higher levels.

However, the upsloping 21-day EMA ($3,669.16) and the 55-day EMA ($3,478.51) indicate that the bulls are still in control. If the price rises from the current level and moves above $4,093.92, the price could rally to higher levels.

On the other hand, if the price breaks below the support zone in blue and 21-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls have given up and are booking profits. That might push the pair down to the 55-day EMA ($3,478.51).

üìàüí∞  Welcome to Your Channel! 
Welcome to your very own channel! Here, we embark on a collaborative journey to analyze and scrutinize financial markets, aiming to achieve substantial profits together. Today, let's dive into the exciting world of cryptocurrency, focusing on  Ethereum .

üìâüîç  Ethereum and Bitcoin Correlation 
As you can see on the chart provided, Ethereum's movements mirror those of Bitcoin. This is because they are correlated pairs, often moving in the same direction or exhibiting similar price action.

üåüüìà  Smart Money Technique 
Comparing Ethereum to Bitcoin, you'll notice an  SMT  (Smart Money Technique) , which signals a potential bullish reversal. This suggests that we can expect a price reversal from the lows due to the presence of SMT.

üöÄüìä  Bearish Fair Value Gap Analysis 
Additionally, the  SMT  candle has formed a Bearish  FVG  (Fair Value Gap), indicating a likely price reaction. If we observe a lower timeframe setup and enter a long position today, we can anticipate the price reaching the  CE (50%)  level of the FVG. After this, we should take partial profits and trail our stop-loss, awaiting further price action for more insights.

üìäüìâ  Bullish and Bearish Scenarios 
Overall, we can expect a bullish movement for Ethereum. However, if the price fails to rise and continues to decline, we've marked critical levels, including the SSL (Sell Side Liquidity) below the SMT, and a significant unfilled FVG. We can expect a price reaction at these levels.

üöÄüìà  Stay Tuned for More Insights 
Thank you for joining us on this insightful journey into the world of cryptocurrency! Understanding the dynamics of BTCUSDT and BTC.D can significantly enhance your trading strategy. Stay tuned for more market analysis and updates. Until next time, happy trading!

Despite the market downturn, ETH's price remains above the crucial mirror support zone at $3,650, still leaving room for growth and a potential new ATH.

‚ùóÔ∏èHowever, a likely scenario before the ETH-ETF launch is a corrective dip, allowing big players (funds) to buy at better prices.

üìâ Therefore, a decline to the $3,400 - $3,200 range is entirely possible. This is where the Fibonacci correction zone and the 100-200 MA on the 8-hour timeframe are located.

Remember: The bearish scenario will only play out if the current support is broken.

Based on the historical market, the bitcoin halving event would followed with a significant price growth of the crypto assets, which matches the current market status. Thus, a bull market are expected in the next one and a half year.

As for the sentiment analysis, the current funding rate in bitcoin perpetual market are maintaining a slight negativity in the past 2 weeks, that indicate a stronger short bias in the general market. And the open interests drops up to 20~30% from its all time high, in which alt coin market drops even further, for instance open interest of dogecoin dramatically drops 60% up to todays date. Therefore, its treated as a cooling off of the bull hype in first quarter of 2024, which viable long opportunities are provided. 

Above statement convey that a definite bull market are expected from now to the coming 2025, and current the market sentiment are expecting a strong short bias, which given a much higher liquidity for accumulation. Therefore technical analysis can be deploy to identify longs opportunity.

Technical specking, by using the vegas tunnel system in combined with a retracement type of price entries, the current mark prices of ETH is matching the condition for a high risk reward ratio and a high winning possibility trade. And a much wider growth space in compare to the bitcoin market.

Looks like ETH might be heading down after NFP and delay of rate cut. My prediction is at least going to touch 3500 if it doesn't hold then we might see an even deeper retest of the lower resistance. Just my own opinion tho don't shit on me.

This is amazing to see. With ETH's wick price action perfectly tested our trendline showing strong support is still at that level. This is a trendline we have been outlining in these previous posts:

  



Therefore, ETH might have the power to now break the $4k level since we have successfully defended the buy level so far. Will keep this chart updated.

Not Financial Advice 

TL;DR Bullish Pennant on  BINANCE:ETHUSDT  daily chart, upwards breakout target would be very close to 2021 ATH. SEC approval of VanEck ETF (final deadline on May 23) could be a major catalyst.

A rare case of (potential) technical and fundamental confluence:

 
 ETH has been building a Bullish Pennant since the end of the Feb 5 - Mar 12 rally
 The retest of the multi-month support in place since October 2023 might signal that the bottom is in
 The final deadline for SEC's approval of VanEck's ETH ETF lines up almost perfectly with the convergence between the pennant's resistance and the multi-month support
 Interestingly enough, the target for an upwards breakout of the pennant around VanEck's approval deadline would be very close to the 2021 ATH
___
So this is a very good lesson for all of us, a confirmed break out needs at least one more strong green candle. In this case it obviously did not happen. Patients really pays off, NO FOMO!

BINANCE:ETHUSD  breaks the resistance of consolidation pattern amid the news related to the approval of ETH-ETF. The reaction was premature, on rumors, and now the market is consolidating.



Many wondered why there was not a strong surge and rally after the news. Reason: The rise from 3100 to 3850, almost 24% in a few hours, which followed due to the rumors about the approval of ETH-ETF was already embedded in the reaction, so the market did not have the potential to go up further, as there was strong resistance ahead, it would not have had enough strength. 
Now, ETH is forming consoidation to go up. The candlestick patterns on both W1, D1 and H4 form interesting bullish premises indicating that it is the buyer who is assembling a position with the aim of breaking the 3830-3950 resistance with the aim of rallying and updating ATH. 

 Resistance levels: 3830, 3952, 4086
Support levels: 3730, 3660 

Technically, a correction is forming. Within the correction the market is in consolidation. The correction will end when the price breaks through and consolidates above the mentioned resistance zones. Emphasis on 3830, as well as on the descending resistance at the local highs

BINANCE:ETHUSDT  has broken out of its range zone and triangle pattern, propelling the market upwards with a new extension. Currently, the market is trading above the 3700 level, indicating a strong bullish momentum presence. If price experiences a pullback to support level and downward trendline, I believe it may be an opportunity to buy as the market's upward trajectory is gaining strength. The recent update of swing highs and higher lows suggests a strong bullish momentum. On the weekly timeframe, a significant candle has formed, creating a large buying area from 3700 to 3000. Given the market's break of the range, I expect to see a pullback followed by an ABC correction and subsequent continuation of the uptrend. My goal is the resistance zone at 3930.00

Here is a quick look at ETH. Not much happening in crypto lately in my opinion. 
If you've been in the crypto market for long enough and have experienced more than 1 halving and/or cycle you already know what's happening. 

We are simply in an accumulation phase  and trading within 'tight' ranges on most assets until we 'breakout' either to the buyside or sellside. 

IF we hold the current HTF FVG (yellow box) expect ETH to continue higher towards 4000$ 
IF we fail to hold and close below 3700$ expect us to hunt the sellside liquidity resting around 3500$ 

No need to front run the market...let it come to you.

The daily chart for Ethereum (ETH) against USDT provides a detailed view of the price movements and key levels that could indicate potential future actions:

Resistance Levels:

R1 ($4,126.11): This level has been a recent high and could act as the first significant resistance.
R2 ($4,371.66) and R3 ($4,752.50): These are the subsequent resistance levels that the price may encounter if it breaks past R1. R2 and R3 could serve as targets for taking profits if Ethereum enters a bullish phase.
Support Levels:

S1 ($3,301.24): This is the nearest support level where the price might find a floor if there's a pullback.
S2 ($2,874.64) and S3 ($2,112.62): These lower supports may come into play if there is a significant downward trend or market correction.
Current Market Position:

The price of ETH is currently hovering near $3,771.07, positioning it above S1 but below R1. This suggests some consolidation between these levels.
Technical Indicators:

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD is close to zero with a slight bullish histogram, suggesting that there might be a buildup in bullish momentum, although the signal isn‚Äôt strong yet.
RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 66, which is moderately high but still below the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that there might still be room for upward movement without immediate overbought concerns.
Market Sentiment:

The descending trendline from the peak in April to the present suggests that ETH has been under a bearish control but is now potentially trying to break this trend. A confirmed breakout above this trendline could signal a change in momentum to bullish.
Trading Strategy:

Bullish Scenario: Should ETH break above the descending trendline and R1, traders might consider long positions with targets at R2 and R3, setting stop losses just below R1.
Bearish Scenario: If ETH fails to break the descending trendline and drops below S1, this could indicate a continuation of the bearish trend, with potential targets at S2 and S3. Traders might look to short ETH or exit long positions to minimize losses.
Conclusion: Traders should monitor Ethereum‚Äôs reaction to the descending trendline closely. A breakout above this line and R1 could herald a new bullish phase targeting higher resistances. However, a failure to surpass these levels and a subsequent drop below S1 could extend the bearish sentiment. As always, market conditions, global economic factors, and news specific to Ethereum should be considered when making trading decisions.
___
In a recent rally, Ethereum demonstrated significant momentum. In our video analysis, we delve into potential long positions, contingent upon price meeting our entry criteria. Observing the 4-hour chart, we note a prior bearish trend that has now been disrupted by a bullish break in market structure. My bias leans toward a long position, but it remains subject to price action developments outlined in the video.

-------------------------------------


I think the superTrend indicator is a good indicator for checking trends.

Also, when the superTrend indicator shows a horizontal line, it can act as support and resistance, so I think it is an even better indicator.

However, it is difficult to use it in trading by adding it to the chart.

Therefore, I think it is one of the indicators that is not used much when actually trading.

In my chart, it is used to construct the BW indicator, but this is the reason why it is not displayed near the actual price chart.

The superTrend indicator creates a buy line and a sell line.

When the buy line forms a horizontal line, it can be interpreted as a buying period if it shows support.

On the other hand, when the sell line forms a horizontal line, it can be interpreted as a selling period if it shows resistance.

However, when the buy line or sell line is created by breaking, it can be used as an opposite concept.

Therefore, when the buy line -> sell line changes, it should be interpreted as a loss-cutting period.

On the other hand, when the sell line -> buy line changes, it should be interpreted as an (aggressive) buying period.

Therefore, when the lines intersect, you should draw a separate horizontal line and create a response strategy.

As explained above, you can see that there are two ways to interpret the supperTrend indicator.

Therefore, you should look at how the buy line or sell line is created.

You should look at whether the buy line or sell line is connected by a line or created by intersecting each other, and create a response strategy accordingly.


It is also better to use the superTrend indicator with other indicators rather than using it alone.

In my chart, I recommend looking at it with the MS-Signal indicator (M-Signal on 1M, 1W, and 1D charts).

The reason is that the superTrend indicator is also a trend indicator.

If you use the MS-Signal indicator, you may wonder if you really need to use the superTrend indicator, but I think it is worth using because the superTrend indicator also has areas that play the role of support and resistance.

Have a good time.
Thank you.

4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

The ETH trading setup appears favorable for a short position. The MACD indicator has shown a crossover, and with an appropriately sized stop loss, the setup offers a potential 1.5 times risk-to-reward ratio.

Current Situation:
Last week, Ethereum (ETH) moved sideways with a modest 1.5% price increase. Bulls made several attempts to push ETH above $3,900 but faced strong resistance.

Key Resistance and Support Levels:

Resistance Level: $4,000
Immediate Resistance: $3,900
Support Levels: $3,700 and $3,500
Price Action:

Despite multiple attempts, ETH has been unable to break the $3,900 level, indicating that the $4,000 resistance will require more time to be surpassed.
The sideways movement under this key resistance suggests that ETH is consolidating and preparing for a potential breakout.
Trend Analysis:

Bullish Outlook: The overall trend remains bullish. As long as the price continues to consolidate under $4,000, the asset has a good chance to eventually break this level and make new highs in 2024.
Support Levels: If sellers push the price lower, strong support is found at $3,700 and further at $3,500.
Looking Ahead:

June Outlook: Another attempt to break the $4,000 resistance could occur in June, given the current bullish trend and consolidation pattern.
Trade Strategy:

For Bulls: Monitor for a breakout above $3,900 and $4,000 for potential long opportunities targeting new highs.
For Bears: Watch the support levels at $3,700 and $3,500 for potential short opportunities if the price retraces.
Stay informed and ready for potential movements in the Ethereum market.

We had a very aggressive green candle, which makes me believe they would want to recover this green vector, Once we reach tp1 we close 25% of the position. and set stoploss to entry. I don't expect it to reach till tp3. its about how it moves
___
I already entered the trade but still room to make decent RR for anyone who wants to follow along now. Price is at $3800 right now.

Price rejected daily support and have free space to move up to $3900, already showed signs of reversal with the 4hr shifting bullish and maintaining the $3800 area on retest.

Shifted bearish on 1hr last night but currently forming double bottom again support signs of reversal for continuation to the upside.

Htfs like weekly and monthly also bullish.

I got some other confirmations as well but lets keep it short.

I'll leave my TP open for now and monitor at the prices shown on my chart. I'll update here if I make a decision to take partial or close- If no update then am holding. Hard close at $4100 if somehow we get enough volume to pump there today. I anticipate a short squeeze just don't know if it be today or tomorrow - It depends on volume. 

$3900 seems like a reasonable target for today though.

Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders,

ETH has been hovering within a narrow range in the shape of a flat rising channel around a massive resistance zone $4,000 - $4,100.

 What's next? 

Scenarios:

 1Ô∏è‚É£ Bullish - Continuation 

The bulls maintain control as long as ETH is trading within the rising channel marked in red.

In this case, a movement towards the $4,000 - $4,100 resistance zone would be expected.

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bearish - Correction 

If the last low marked in green is broken downward, we will expect the bearish correction to start leading to a movement towards $3,100 demand zone.

Which scenario is more likely to happen first? and why?

üìö  Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

Chart definitely looks way more bullish then BTC

Currently consolidating above support. To be honest not really got a clear read on this would be looking for maybe a move into $3,630's for a long. Its a chart I'd rather look at once a move has happened.

üîçEthereum (ETH) is the coin of the day, a project that stands out from other altcoins due to its significant market dominance and substantial capital investment in both its network and coin. Unlike many other altcoins, Ethereum is less dependent on Bitcoin, making it an interesting asset to analyze independently.

üîÑPrevious Analysis Recap
In the previous analysis, it was suggested to enter a long position upon breaking 3798 with a target of 4063. After entering the position and reaching a risk-to-reward ratio of 2, I took partial profits and moved my stop loss to the entry point. The price did not move higher and eventually hit the stop loss at the entry point, resulting in a small profit due to the partial profit-taking.

‚åõÔ∏è4-Hour Timeframe
Current Situation: After forming a low at 3652, the volume has significantly decreased. Given the weekend lull, market momentum has completely dissipated. The 99-period SMA is approaching, potentially acting as the last hope for bullish momentum to re-enter the market.
üîëKey Levels:
Resistance: 3960 (first resistance), 4063 (key resistance)
Support: 3652 (current low)

‚ö°Ô∏èIndicators:
RSI: Watch for a break above 54.46 for bullish momentum confirmation.
99-period SMA: Approaching price, may provide support or resistance.

üìàBullish Scenario
Entry: Break above 3960.
Target: Initial target at 4063.
If 4063 is broken and price stabilizes above this level, a significant upward move could be expected, especially benefiting Ethereum ecosystem coins.
Confirmation: RSI breaking above 54.46.

Long Position
Primary Trigger: Enter on a break above 3960.
Secondary Trigger: Enter on a break and stabilization above 4063 for a stronger bullish confirmation.
RSI Confirmation: Watch for a break above 54.46 to confirm bullish momentum.
Note: Monitor the price action around 4063 carefully, as it is a crucial resistance level.

üìâBearish Scenario
Entry: First trigger at 3719 (risky), main entry on a break below 3652.
Target: Following a break below 3652, look for confirmation of bearish momentum with a break below 41.03 on the RSI.

Short Position
Primary Trigger: Break below 3652.
Secondary Trigger: For a riskier entry, consider 3719, but the main focus should be on 3652.
RSI Confirmation: A break below 41.03 would confirm bearish momentum.

üìùEthereum is currently in a consolidation phase with key support at 3652 and resistances at 3960 and 4063. The low volume suggests that a significant move could be imminent. Traders should watch for breaks of these critical levels to enter positions, with volume and RSI serving as additional confirmation indicators. Always keep an eye on market conditions and adjust positions accordingly.

üß†üíºIt's important to acknowledge the inherent risks in futures trading, with the potential for margin calls if risk management is neglected. Always adhere to strict capital management principles and utilize stop-loss orders, ensuring that the initial target offers a risk-to-reward ratio of 2.

The Ethereum (ETH) coin has picked strength and is on the verge to trigger a massive blast.

Let's go for Ethereum $4000 or Ethereum $3500!!?

what do you think?

We have HH and HL on the chart so far; In other words, we do not have confirmation for a downward trend (((currently))). The resistance range that we had on the price area of ‚Äã‚Äã$3943 has also been completely consumed.

As the resistance areas are consumed, the way to continue the upward trend is opened.

Now, on the price chart, a compression movement has been formed in the 30-minute time frame; Provided that the price range of $3,628 is maintained, there is a high possibility that we will get out of this compression from above.

But we have to be careful, the possibility of getting out of this compression from the bottom is not small. Especially since currently 68% of Ethereum holders are in profit.

I imagine such a movement for Ethereum in the coming days. A side trend between prices of 3500 and 4900 dollars..

üìä#ETH has a chance to form a bearish head and shouldersüìâ

üß†We have been consolidating within the target zone after achieving our daily long target. From a structural point of view, we have the opportunity to build a bearish head and shoulders structure. A break below the uptrend support line 1 increases the probability of a bearish head and shoulders. After breaking below inflection point 1, a bearish head and shoulders is established.‚úîÔ∏è

üî•If this bearish structure holds true, then the short target area we will first focus on is around 3321-3365üéØ
