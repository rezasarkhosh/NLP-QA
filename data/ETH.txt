Page1, Article 1: BINANCE:ETHUSD  is forming a counter-trend bounce and is aiming for strong resistance amid a bearish trend. The project is going through a rough patch, fumbling for a market bottom... 

  

 ETH faces troubles::  
WisdomTree has requested the withdrawal of its ETH (Ethereum Trust) fund registration application three years after filing with the SEC. Earlier, VanEck closed its futures ETH-ETF, citing lack of demand. 
Likewise, indicators suggest that Whale stopped accumulating ETH since July. Since then, they have been mostly selling. 
Technically, we see the market being squeezed by strong resistance: trend lines as well as moving averages, which may negatively affect the market, keeping the coin from rising.

 Resistance levels: 2375, 2460, 2510. 
Support levels: 2309, 2111 

The coin is heading towards the resistance and liquidity area amid a bearish trend. This can be seen as a manipulated move to capture liquidity before further testing the intermediate bottom. I expect a decline from the mentioned zones towards 2100-2000. 

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:ETHUSD   ;)

Page1, Article 3: On a smaller timeframe, we had another rejection from that small resistance zone where price is being pressured into a corner here. 

Now with that sharp trend we have (bullish), we are looking for a short setup to form here but before that, we need to see a break of the lower Bollinger Bands Line, which will also break the trend line. 

If we do not see that and we see another test to resistance zone, then we will see most likely a move to 200 EMA.

Page1, Article 5: Ethereum Weekly Update 

Ethereum (ETH) is showing a promising bounce from a significant support zone, ranging between $2,000 and $2,150. This area has acted as a key level of support since mid-2022, and it continues to hold strong. Additionally, this zone aligns with a crucial ascending support line that has supported the price for nearly two years.

On the 3-day chart, ETH has rebounded from a "golden pocket," a technical term that refers to a major support area in the price range of $2,150 to $2,200. Given the confluence of these factors, it's highly likely that Ethereum will maintain support in this range for the near term, although we need more confirmation to signal a full bullish reversal.

Looking at the daily chart, we‚Äôve just seen the first sign of bullish divergence. This occurs when the price makes a higher low while the RSI (Relative Strength Index) does the same, indicating growing bullish momentum. We‚Äôve confirmed this with one green candle close and a higher low on the RSI. If we see another daily candle close in green, it would give further confirmation of bullish strength.

However, despite these early signs of a possible reversal, the larger trend for Ethereum still remains bearish. This means that while we may see some short-term price relief or consolidation, we haven't yet confirmed a longer-term bullish trend. Over the next few days or even weeks, we could expect the price to either consolidate sideways or experience a small upward relief, but we need more signals to confirm a sustained uptrend.

#Crypto
Page1, Article 6: Ethereum buyers are struggling to maintain the current push from the lower support zone. 

This is a very crucial zone for buyers, as if they do not show any dominance here we will see a failed double bottom pattern, which usually ends with a very sharp selloff near that support zone. 

So we wait to see one of two things: either a huge green candle or a slow movement to support where we will be looking for a short position!

Page1, Article 7: Three months red? It never happens. It only happened in 2022 and that's because we were dealing with a bear-market.

Then it happened again in 2018 but that is because we were dealing with a bear-market. The ensuing years, never, never three months red. It is like the launch of the spot ETFs changed the market dynamics, it changed our map.

Ok, the map changed so what?
We adapt to market conditions, that's what we do, it is not like we cannot adapt pretty easily.

Ethereum closed three months red already, something that only happened twice on this chart, in 2022 and 2018. Apart from these bear-market years, Ethereum would never close three consecutive months red let alone four or five.

Relief?

‚û¢ Since we have three months that closed red the market calls for a relief rally?
‚û¢ Since we have three months red the market must turn?
‚û¢ Since we have three months red the fourth must be bullish?

Anything can happen but we read the chart.
Three months red is a bearish signal, but relief is always necessary.

Let's look at some scenarios.

Say this month wicks down strong and closes green; that's relief.
Say this month closes red and next month (October) and the month after (November) close green; that would be a relief rally.

We can impose our beliefs on the market, saying "this must happen" or "that must happen for this or that reason," or we can read the chart, see what is actually happening and determine based on this data what is likely to happen next.

The times that Ethereum closed three months red it continued red for another six additional months. Market conditions are different now, but we can only be guided by the data on the chart.

The weekly MACD and RSI are on the bearish zone.
The monthly MACD and RSI are both trending down strong.

‚ûñ ETHUSDT Monthly RSI: 

‚ûñ ETHUSDT Monthly MACD: 
(Bearish cross in the making.)

This is the monthly chart, one candle is 720 stronger than the hourly chart.

Maybe it will grow, but I need confirmation by seeing prices going up.

As long as it is red, it is going down.

Thanks a lot for your support.

Namaste.
Page1, Article 8: Ethereum has finally reached the support zone we‚Äôve been watching since last week.

Now that the price is in that zone, we‚Äôre anticipating a potential bounce, which has been playing out well so far. If buyers manage to secure this area, we should see a nice recovery towards the EMAs. However, if they fail, the price could gradually break below the support, leading to a broken double bottom pattern, which typically triggers a strong downward selloff

Swallow Team
Page1, Article 9: Ethereum has reached a very important zone where price has now reached the lower zone of upward trend (where also 200EMA is acting as a support).

Now ideally we should see a good bounce from here and a movement to the upper zone or at least that middle line of Bollinger bands (which is in bearish trend currently).

So we wait for a propper bounce to happen from here but bear in mind. Overall market conditions are not looking good so if everything goes against our plans, then a good downward movement will happen (if the EMA zone will be secured by sellers).

Page1, Article 10: ETH: Bearish Pattern Remains Intact

Ethereum has respected our previous analysis and reached the first target. 
Today, we observe a larger contracting triangle pattern, indicating the potential for further downward movement.

 With the release of the ADP data today, market speculation is expected to be high.  
It is possible that ETH may test the $2,500 level again before moving down, but it could also decline from the current market price.

üìà ETH has been bearish as an over-extended correction phase, and currently approaching a massive support and round number $2000.

The $2000 is also intersecting with a long-term trendline.

(1M chart)

As you can see from the 1M chart, the trading volume occurred in the box section.

-
(1W chart)

As you can see from the 1W chart, the point where the volume profile section is formed is 1021.49, 2354.39.

Therefore, the key is whether it can be supported near 2354.39.

---------------------------------------------

(1D chart)

Since the HA-Low indicator of the 1D chart was formed at 2359.35, it is important to see if it can be supported around here and rise above the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator.

Therefore, it is important to see if it can rise to around 2531.05-2621.99 and maintain the price.

-
Since the StochRSI indicator is showing signs of a change in slope in the overbought zone, if it falls without being supported around 2359.35, it is necessary to check if it is supported around 2196.52.

Since ETH has fallen below the M-Signal indicator on the 1M chart, it can be seen as turning into a downtrend from a long-term perspective.

So, we need to see which way it deviates from the 2196.52-2621.99 range.

The next volatility period for ETH is around September 26th.

-
Have a nice time.
Thank you.

(ETHUSDT Renko 1D chart)

We need to check whether the price can be maintained above 2400.0 and whether it can rise above 2600.0 to create an upward block.

-----------------------------------------------

(ETHUSDT 1D chart)

The key is whether the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator can rise above and maintain the price.

Unlike BTC, ETHUSDT is not yet above the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator.

In order to turn into a short-term uptrend, the price must rise above 2531.05-2621.99 and maintain the price.

If not, we need to check for support near 2359.35.

-
I think the StochRSI indicator is currently forming a high point because the slope has changed in the overbought zone.

Therefore, the 2531.05-2621.99 zone is an important support and resistance zone.

--------------------------------------------------


Once you start studying charts and become familiar with them, trend lines are virtually unnecessary.

However, since understanding the HA-MS indicator is necessary, I drew trend lines to help you understand the chart.

This can actually be a hindrance to looking at the chart.

If you are looking at my charts for the first time, the most important thing is the MS-Signal indicator, which is the arrangement of the M-Signal line, which is the main line of the MS-Signal indicator on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

This is how you can predict the trend.

The next important thing is related to the HA-Low and HA-High indicators.

That is, you will trade based on the movement in the box section of the HA-Low and HA-High indicators.

The other lines are lines that represent the support and resistance lines drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts and the volume profile section.

Therefore, if you want to know the trend through chart analysis, you can check the location of the M-Signal indicator on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts corresponding to the MS-Signal indicator.

If you want to trade, you can create a trading strategy by referring to the points made up of the HA-Low and HA-High indicators or the support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.


If you only display the support and resistance points by key indicators, it is like the chart above.

You can trade with this alone, but I think it is likely that you will have difficulty trading because you cannot create a response strategy according to price fluctuations.

What you want to inform through chart analysis is that only the person who analyzed it can properly understand the content.

Therefore, how you accept the content analyzed by others will vary depending on each person's investment style.

Hello everyone,
ETHUSDT is currently holding on to a long-standing trendline that has provided consistent support over time. The price has bounced off this trendline multiple times, but the recent repeated dips to $2093 and $2150 have created a scenario where further pressure could potentially lead to a break below this support. The significant drop in volume raises concerns about a possible downward move. For ETH to avoid breaking this key support, it would need to rally and break and give weekly closing above the resistance level at $2535, which could signal a reversal of the current downtrend. 
If the trendline breaks, the below support zones will likely come into play.

Upper support zone:
SUPPORT ZONE= $1695 to $1827

Lower support zone:
SUPPORT ZONE= $1274 to $1371

Initially looking for the range high target at 2810. This would confirm the double bottom, and the expectations above that would be a 1.618 extension, or as high as the measured move of the double bottom. 

A break above the upper supply line would then raise the targets to 4490-4885, and as high as about 6k for a 1.618 extension of the correction. 

Breaking the local supply line, and retesting the top of the range would be a great start here.
Page2, Article 1: The weekly chart of ETH/USDT shows a strong ascending trendline support that has been respected over the past several months.
The price is currently testing this trendline support near the $2,300 level, suggesting a potential bounce from this key support area.
The primary support level is the ascending trendline around $2,000 to $2,300. Holding this level is crucial for maintaining the bullish structure.
 A major resistance zone is highlighted between $4,200 and $5,000. This area has acted as a significant supply zone in the past and is likely to be a major obstacle to further upward movement.

If ETH can hold above the trendline support and gain momentum, a potential rally toward the $4,200 to $5,000 resistance zone could occur. This would align with the chart's upward arrow, indicating optimism for a continued upward move.
 If the price fails to hold the support and breaks below the trendline, we might see a deeper correction, potentially testing lower supports around $1,700 to $2,000.

A weekly close above $2,400 with increased volume would provide a strong bullish confirmation, suggesting a higher probability of testing the $4,200-$5,000 resistance zone.
Monitoring RSI, MACD, or other momentum indicators on the weekly timeframe could provide additional confirmation of a potential trend reversal or continuation.

The presence of a large upward arrow on the chart indicates a bullish sentiment, expecting a rebound from the current levels.
Broader market conditions, Bitcoin's price action, and macroeconomic factors will also play significant roles in ETH's price trajectory.

Traders should consider setting stop-loss orders below the ascending trendline or the $2,000 level to manage downside risk effectively.
Regularly review and adjust positions based on evolving market conditions and price actions near key levels.
This weekly update outlines the critical levels and scenarios for ETH/USDT, highlighting the importance of the ascending trendline support for the continuation of the bullish outlook. Watch for confirmation signals and stay aware of market influences that could affect ETH's performance.

Page2, Article 2: Description

Ethereum (ETH), as a leading blockchain platform, is primed for potential investment opportunities based on its robust fundamentals:

- **Transition to Ethereum 2.0:** Ethereum's upgrade to a proof-of-stake model under Ethereum 2.0 aims to significantly increase its transaction speed and decrease energy consumption, potentially boosting its attractiveness and value.
- **Widespread Adoption:** Ethereum's platform is the foundation for numerous decentralized applications (dApps), including those in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which could drive further demand and increase the value of ETH.
- **Institutional Interest:** Increasing interest and investment in Ethereum by institutional investors can provide more stability and growth potential for ETH.
- **Network Improvements:** Ongoing improvements and protocol enhancements continue to solve issues such as high gas fees and network congestion, making Ethereum more user-friendly and scalable.

Given these developments, buying ETH could be a strategic move for investors looking to benefit from its core strengths and long-term growth potential in the blockchain ecosystem.

Page2, Article 9: ETH/USDT is currently trading within a descending wedge pattern (marked by converging white trendlines). This pattern typically suggests a potential bullish reversal upon a breakout to the upside. The price is approaching the apex, indicating that a breakout could occur soon.

There is a strong horizontal support zone around $2,100 to $2,200 (highlighted in brown). This level has been tested multiple times and continues to act as a solid base, preventing further downside.

The immediate resistance lies along the upper trendline of the descending wedge, around $2,400.
A breakout above this trendline could lead to a move towards higher resistance zones near $2,660 and beyond.
 ETH is trading at $2,358.66, up 1.53%. The price has bounced from the lower trendline and is making its way towards the upper boundary of the wedge.

 If ETH breaks out of the descending wedge, the first target would be around the $2,500-$2,600 zone. A sustained move above this level could trigger a larger rally towards the $2,780 level, aligning with prior highs.

 If ETH fails to break out and drops below the $2,100 support zone, further downside could be expected, potentially retesting levels closer to $2,000 or below.

Including indicators like RSI or MACD could help gauge the strength of the potential breakout and provide additional confirmation of the trend 

ETH/USDT is currently in a descending wedge pattern, with a bullish bias if it manages to break above the upper trendline resistance around $2,400. The key support at $2,100-$2,200 remains crucial for bulls to maintain control. Monitoring the price action around these critical levels will be essential for confirming the next major move.

Page2, Article 10: There has been a price forming a triangle on the chart for a long time.

The downtrend channel forming the top of the triangle indicates the most critical region for a price breakout. For now, it seems like there is still time to reach that point. It may be a bit early to think that a rise will happen soon before this downtrend channel is broken.

At the same time, the support channel forming the lower part of the triangle appears to be a healthy zone for accumulation. In other words, for long-term investors, as long as this green box is not broken downwards, it seems like a buying zone.

However, we can't know how close the movement can get to the end of the triangle or how long it will take to break it. It just seems to need a little more time.
Page2, Article 11: üìä#ETH long structure is intact ‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, the double bottom long structure has not been destroyed, so we can still look forward to higher targets. At present, we are still suppressed by the strong resistance of 2400. Only by breaking through the resistance here can we challenge the short defense point.

Page2, Article 16: On a smaller timeframe, we are seeing a good possibility for a rejection to happen from current zones. 

As Bollinger Bands is in an overbought zone, we are now seeing a struggle to breakout from the current zone, so a possible rejection from this zone is still in play. 

If we somehow see a breakout crom current zone, then our next zone will be 200 EMA.

Page2, Article 18: #ETHUSDT

According to our opinion, Ethereum has penetrated the floor of $900 and the purchase order has been cleared at this price level.

From above, it has hit its daily true zone QM and after the start of its downward rally, it has cleared its FL or local resistance and is correcting an upward price and starting the next downward step.


Liquidity below the weekly long-term trend line confirms this.

We move step by step with the price....
Page2, Article 19: Ethereum is looking to breakout, however it will probably follow BTC with its price action. I would set take profit targets at the 3 resistance levels, to see a breakout to above 3000, we need to first see breakout of these resistance levels, so set some take profit on these 3 prices (or just in those ranges) to re-enter at a lower price if we get rejected. Good luck

Page2, Article 22: Data from cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment has revealed that so called ‚ÄòShark‚Äô addresses on the Ethereum blockchain have over the past year stockpiled over $6.2 billion worth of the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization.these addresses are defined as those holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH, or between $17,500 or $17.5 million worth of the cryptocurrency, and their supply has grown by 554,000 ETH in the past week, according to the platform‚Äôs data.

Meanwhile, however, while ETH sharks have been accumulating heavily, whales on the network have ‚Äúcollectively dumped 9.4 million in the same timeframe.‚Äù These whales are defined as addresses holding between 10,000 and 10 million ETH, meaning from $17.5 million to $17.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. crypto forums are paying close attention to the various banking crises occurring globally. The company notes that ‚Äúlaws and policies going forward may have a dramatic impact on the trajectory of cryptocurrency‚Äù.

Notably, Ethereum is set to undergo its highly-anticipated Shanghai-Capella upgrade, often referred to as Shapella, upgrade on April 12. The upgrade includes one key feature, with Ethereum Improvement Proposal, EIP 4895 will allow for withdrawals of staked Ether on the network, a functionality that wasn‚Äôt implemented when the network merged with the Beacon Chain and transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus.the upgrade will also feature three other improvements aimed at optimizing gas costs for certain activities. The upgrade is set to take place on April 12 at epoch number 620,9536. Shapella is coming after multiple phases of public testing on three testnets, including Sepolia, Zhejiang, and Goerli. The upgrade was earlier this week deployed on the Goerli testnet as a final rehearsal ahead of the mainnet launch.

The price of Ethereum is $1,820 today with a 24hour trading volume of 14 billion dollar. This represents a 5% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 27% price increase in the past 7 days

next targets are 1830, 1840 and 1850$

Page3, Article 6: ETH recent pump was an indication of things to come -- good things.

The coin went from 1700 to 1900 within 72 hours -- indicating that a longer shifting trend is about to materialize. Based on recent news, low supply of ETH is being detected on most exchanges depicting a bullish scenario for the coin.

On weekly data, new higher lows was created both on Histogram and pricing -- conveying the recent ascend with the current price range to be the new base for the incoming significant price growth.

Weekly data price movement volatility has been on the conservative side hinting that for every higher low it established -- it is creating a solid support range.

On Tri monthly data -- it is hinting of the same bullish continuation scenario. Surging price valuation on longer time spectrum. A bubble up volume has finally appeared after 5 months of waiting, last one was on January 2023.

Expect significant price valuation for ETH in the next coming weeks.

Page3, Article 7: Ethereum is showing some signs of push here but nothing is yet confirmed.

Looking right now at the candles, we are still seeing pressure from sellers and for ETH to see any kind of bullish momentum here, buyers need to secure that dotted line (orange one).

If they manage to secure it, we will see further small upward movement, but if they do not manage to secure it, we will see a test of support and most likely a break of it as well!

Page3, Article 16: Hi guys

We are at the bottom of the upward channel. On the other hand, the amount of Ethereum in the centralized exchange has reached the lowest historical level. It seems that investors are not sellers at these rates.

In the four-hour time frame, it seems that with the consumption of the $2408.3 support area, we can expect a downward trend similar to the scenario from the specified resistance range.

On the daily time frame, according to maintaining the support area and ascending channel, provided that the ascending trend line is maintained, the price area of ‚Äã‚Äã$2250 can be attractive for buying.

what do you think?

Page3, Article 20: Hey Realistic Traders,  let's dive into the technical analysis of  BINANCE:ETHUSDT   

In the H4 timeframe, the price stubbornly stays below the EMA100,  reinforcing the strong bearish trend we've been watching . A rising wedge pattern had formed, but recently, the price took a dive, breaking out of that pattern with high trading volume‚Äînever a good sign for the bulls. Adding fuel to the fire, the MACD has made a bearish crossover, with the MACD line slipping below the signal line, signaling that the downward momentum is picking up steam.

With all these technical indicators lining up, we‚Äôre eyeing a potential continuation of this downward journey toward Target Area 1 at 2,252.90 or even Target Area 2 at 2,073.77. However, bulls might find some hope   if the price manages to break above the resistance level at 2,855.96.

It's been  21 hours  since I posted the  BINANCE:ETHUSDT   analysis. The price of ETH is moving back and forth, fluctuating between the  2300 and 2400  range, and there have been  5 trading opportunities  since then.

 Difficulty Review: 
 
 1st and 2nd one are harder because they bounce the price from the 2350.
 The other 3 are easier, and we should aim to nail them.
 

 The future: 
If it break 2100, the long term price will change from Long to neutral, lets see.

Page3, Article 23: Note -
One of the best forms of Price Action is to not try to predict at all. Instead of that, ACT on the price. So, this chart tells at "where" to act in "what direction. Unless it triggers, like, let's say the candle doesn't break the level which says "Buy if it breaks", You should not buy at all.
=======
I use shorthands for my trades.
"Positional" - means You can carry these positions and I do not see sharp volatility ahead. (I tally upcoming events and many small kinds of stuff to my own tiny capacity.)
"Intraday" -means You must close this position at any cost by the end of the day.
"Theta" , "Bounce" , "3BB" or "Entropy" - My own systems.
=======
I won't personally follow any rules. If I "think" (It is never gut feel. It is always some reason.) the trade is wrong, I may take reverse trade. I may carry forward an intraday position. What is meant here - You shouldn't follow me because I may miss updating. You should follow the system I share.
=======
Like -
Always follow a stop loss.
In the case of Intraday trades, it is mostly the "Day's High".
In the case of Positional trades, it is mostly the previous swings.
I do not use Stop Loss most of the time. But I manage my risk with options as I do most of the trades using derivatives

Page4, Article 2: The chart depicts a descending channel, with ETH/USDT currently trading near the lower boundary of the channel, which has historically acted as a support level.
ETH is approaching a key horizontal support zone around $2,100-$2,200, where buyers may look for entry opportunities.


The major support zone lies between $2,100 and $2,200, as highlighted on the chart. This level aligns with the lower trendline of the broader ascending trend from the past year, suggesting a confluence of support.
 Immediate resistance is located between $2,800 and $3,000. A further resistance zone is identified around the $4,000-$4,600 range, which corresponds to a previous major supply area.

The chart suggests a bullish scenario where ETH could initially rebound from the current support area, targeting the $2,800-$3,000 resistance zone.
A breakout above the descending channel and subsequent resistance zone would indicate a stronger bullish continuation, potentially targeting the higher resistance at $4,000-$4,600.

The presence of the large upward arrow on the chart reflects optimism for a bullish bounce within the identified zones.
Continuation of the broader uptrend depends on maintaining support levels and breaking through key resistance zones with momentum.
This update suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for ETH/USDT with clear levels to watch for bullish confirmation and risk management considerations. Keeping an eye on volume and price action around these critical zones will be crucial for confirming the next major move.

-------------------------------------


ETH has touched an important support zone.

Therefore, the key is whether it can receive support near 2159.0.

If it falls below 2159.0, you should check whether there is support near 1605.23-1783.0.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

The real uptrend is expected to start when it rises above 29K.

The next expected range to touch is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points that are likely to receive resistance in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this range is touched because it is thought that a new trend can be created in the overshooting range.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.
1st: 43833.05
2nd: 32992.55

-----------------
Page4, Article 5: So, in hindsight it is obvious that the 2.8k level acted as a strong resistance and can be seen as a bearish retest of the breakdown we had on the 4th of august. I must admit that I leaned towards a break above with ETH going for a lower high around 3k, but it is what is is. 

Now ETH is back at the lows of abovementioned breakdown around ~2300$, so there is a slim chance of a double-bottom being formed, usually a very strong pattern, although I must say I'm not fully convinced about it playing out. 

Reason being the long wick we had into low 2k's and the overall weakness of the market. So there is also a chance of a bearish scenario, which would be an aggressive drop below 2k coming days, might even go as low as 1800 but that's REALLY just guessing at this moment. Right now I would say it's 50/50.

IF this double-bottom is real, ETH should hold ~2300$ coming days. Usually the longer it takes for a move it goes the other way. So think if ETH can hold here for another 5-8 days chances increase greatly.

Unfortunately it all depends on the stock market and of course BTC right now. So if the stock market sees a correction later this day, ETH might lose current levels and probably drops below 2k coming days/next week. 

Obvious key level to the upside would be 2.8k. If you want to be safe you should wait for a clean break above and long on retest. Bit more aggressive approach would be longing current levels with a tight stop. Ideally you should not use any stops at all IMO. 

If you trade spot I believe these are decent levels to start buying as you should not worry about a 15-20% correction anyway. See it as a discount if it happens haha. 

Stay safe!
Page4, Article 6: üìâ At Daily Timeframe The Main Structure Is ABC, And Currently The Price Playing At The Wave 5 From C, I Expect a Breakdown The 2300$ Support Toward a 1670$ As a Main Target For This Boring Correction

üëâ I Know It‚Äôs Hard To Accept Bearish Scenarios For Any Coins And Index But Its Better To Trust The Charts, The Whole Market Structure Is Bearish And The Main Thing Is If BTC Goes -5% ETH Goes -7% And Most Of Alts Goes -15%, So It‚Äôs Better To Be Out Of The Market During This Period
Page4, Article 7: While Ethereum is the second biggest Cryptocurrency, it is still an altcoin. Anything can happen within this market.

We already know of the bullish potential and capacity for this and other projects to grow.
We know these are great companies and the future of money, finance, but, we are witnessing a correction now and therefore we have to consider the bearish side. How far down can it go?

Once the correction is over we go back to the bullish potential and how high can it go.

Ethereum underperformed the market recently. This can be due to the fact that it has been growing since June 2022, while others hit bottom in mid to late 2023. 

The weekly MACD shows a strong, more than three years old bearish divergence. It shows the worst conditions and reading since January 2022, when the last bear-market started to gain full force: 

The first baseline level has been compromised. Looking at the weekly timeframe, it is easy to see how much more room there is available for prices to move lower.

The "new baseline," the price at which Ethereum traded around October 2023, the level preceding the last bullish impulse, is the next target. This range goes between $1,750 and $1,550.

The weekly RSI is already bearish, showing an almost 4 years long bearish divergence, and already lost its last support before a full-breakdown. 

Right now the most worrying fact are the Ethereum Spot ETFs; the want in, they went big and they want to buy between $1,000 and $1,200. This would be the level at which ETHUSDT traded around November 2022. I know this sounds really low but some altcoins are already there and right now Ethereum is just an altcoin and it underperformed the market recently (a sign of weakness).

I think the next target is the "new baseline," but I am prepared for all scenarios just in case. It is amazing how fast everything can really change. One day we are relaxed looking at our computers and having fun in every way, the next day we have a crash and prices go much lower than any thought possible the previous day. This is how the markets work, they tend to produce sudden events that we never thought possible. The chart shows the tendency and the market follows with events that confirm and justify what the chart shows.

After the correction is over, we will have a new growth phase and Ethereum can easy go above $10,000, but first we have to see how far down it can go.

We only have a few months left for the entire correction and bottom to settle. After this, we are back on the positive and we think solely about LONG, up and green.

Namaste.
Page4, Article 8: Ethereum is teasing that lower zone, which could result in a nice break of structure. 

We are keeping a close eye on this zone after seeing a successful rejection from the upper resistance zone so now all eyes are on that BOS zone. 

Upon breaking it, we should see a decline to $2125.

Page4, Article 9: Technical Analysis: 

 1. Current Price Below EMAs: 
 
 The price is currently trading below the EMAs, signaling a bearish sentiment. This alignment suggests that the bears are in control, with momentum pushing the price lower.
 The bearish structure is reinforced by the fact that the price broke and retested a key support level, now acting as resistance. This indicates a strong bearish momentum as the price struggles to reclaim the $2,950 level.
 

 2. Key Levels to Watch: 
 
 Bearish Scenario:  The next significant support level to watch is around $2,220. This zone has previously acted as a major liquidity area, and the price could be drawn towards it. A bounce at this level is possible, especially since this zone aligns with a high liquidity level that may attract buyers.
 Potential Bounce:  There is also the possibility of a rebound at the current price level, as it sits at the bottom of the channel. Traders should be aware of the potential for a short-term bullish move if buyers step in to defend this level.
 Bullish Scenario:  For the price to turn bullish, it needs to break above $2,950 and create a structure break (higher high). If the price manages to break this resistance, the next target would be around $3,900.
 

 3. Momentum and Crossover: 
 
 The momentum is currently below the zero line, which adds to the bearish outlook in the short term. However, if momentum begins to shift upwards, it could act as a signal of a potential reversal.
 

 4. Bearish vs. Bullish Outlook: 
 
 Bearish:  As the price remains below the EMAs, the bearish outlook remains dominant. Traders should watch for a retest of $2,220, where a potential bounce could occur.
 Bullish:  To shift to a bullish scenario, the price needs to break above the $2,950 resistance. Confirmation of a higher high would strengthen the case for a rally toward $3,900.
 

 5. Conclusion: 
 
 ETH/USDT is currently in a bearish structure, with the price sitting below the EMAs and facing resistance at $2,950. The next significant support level is $2,220, which could attract buying interest.
 However, a potential rebound from the current price level is possible as the price approaches the lower boundary of the range. Traders should monitor the key levels of $2,950 for a potential breakout to the upside or $2,220 for a possible bounce off the support. Momentum indicators also suggest a bearish continuation unless a shift in momentum occurs.

Page4, Article 10: Hi Dears.
 Eth can go up to 7% but need much more power if want to go upper so its not good for Long
Page4, Article 11: ETH/USDT has been in a downtrend since peaking at around $4,600, with lower highs and lower lows forming a descending pattern.
The current price is near the significant support zone around $2,100, which is crucial for maintaining the bullish structure.

The key support is at $2,100, a historically significant zone that has acted as support during prior market corrections.
 The immediate resistance to watch is around $3,000, a previous support zone that has turned into resistance. A move above this level could lead to further bullish momentum towards the next resistance near $3,800.

A strong bounce from the $2,100 support, potentially leading to a test of the $3,000 resistance. A break above this resistance could target higher levels around $3,800.
Failure to hold the $2,100 support may trigger a deeper decline towards the next support zone around $1,800, or possibly lower if selling pressure intensifies.
Pattern Observation:

The chart suggests a potential double-bottom formation around the $2,100 level, which could indicate a bullish reversal if confirmed by a breakout above the neckline resistance at $3,000.
The presence of a descending triangle pattern also hints at a bearish continuation if the price fails to break above the key resistance.
Volume and Indicators:

Volume analysis will be crucial; an increase in buying volume at the support level would strengthen the case for a reversal.
Oscillators like RSI near oversold conditions would support a potential bounce, while MACD bullish crossovers could confirm a trend change.

For a bullish outlook, setting stop-loss levels just below the $2,100 support is advisable to mitigate downside risk.
A bearish strategy would involve short positions on a confirmed breakdown of the $2,100 level, targeting lower support zones.
This analysis suggests that ETH is at a pivotal support level, where a potential reversal could occur if buying interest increases. Monitoring key levels and volume will provide further insights into the next likely move.

Page4, Article 12: That's a bullish perspective if eth will follow these steps, first to take SC, so first of all price will go a little bit lower than last LH.
After that we have to follow market what we will, I would expect to go higher as on chart, to take out SOS(B), that would confirm Weekly Demand zone.
Page4, Article 13: ETH Weakens Below 2460 

After an impulsive bearish wave that began on August 24 near 2818, the price has been forming a bearish ‚ÄúContracting Triangle Pattern.‚Äù

Today, the price broke out from this bearish pattern and is expected to continue moving downward. The 2460 price zone, which was crucial for the bulls, has now turned into resistance. It appears that bearish sentiment is growing.

The first support level is near 2390, which also serves as a short-term target.

Additional targets where the price may pause are found near 2332 and 2207.

 You may find more details in the chart!
Thank you and Good Luck!

Page4, Article 16: We are looking at a fight between buyers and sellers here, where price has not yet had a break of structure, so that's what we are waiting for. 

We are looking here for a BOS to happen, which would continue the pattern of lower lows to form here!

Swallow Team
Page4, Article 17: We are at a breakpoint with Ethereum, where the price is now at a crucial zone near that major support zone. 

If we manage to break this zone, we will see a strong and steep downward movement, but if we see any kind of bounce, there is a chance of seeing a double bottom pattern here!

Swallow Team
Page4, Article 18: Another day and since yesterdays push, we are seeing the demand for lower zones. 

Sellers are still dominating current zones and candles are not getting as healthy green bodies as they should. 

Our gameplan is leaning right now more towards the further downward movement after reaching the support zone and possibly breaking it so eyes open!

Page4, Article 20: üìä#ETH Bullish Head and Shoulders Structure‚ùì

üß†From a structural perspective, we can see that an obvious bearish cup-and-handle structure has been established, but we need to note that this structure is established within the buying zone of the large cycle, so its effectiveness needs to be verified.

‚û°Ô∏èJudging from today‚Äôs structural evolution, we have the opportunity to build a bullish head and shoulders structure in the buy zone. If this structure holds true, the bearish cup-and-handle structure will fail.

‚û°Ô∏è So if you followed my point of view to go short yesterday, then it is reasonable for you to lock in the main profits before looking forward to more. We did not participate in the short transaction of ETH because we have already done the short transaction of BTC, and their transaction logic is similar.

Page4, Article 23: The updated chart for Ethereum (ETH) against Tether (USDT) in the 4-hour timeframe shows potential for a bullish scenario. Here's the analysis based on the chart:

 The price is currently within a falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern, where price action is making lower highs and lower lows within converging trendlines. This pattern often signals a potential upward breakout.

The price is currently testing the lower boundary of the falling wedge near a significant support zone between $2,335 and $2,455. This area is crucial as it has acted as support in the past and is currently being retested.
Immediate resistance lies at the upper boundary of the wedge around $2,455 to $2,505. A breakout above this level could lead to a bullish continuation towards the next resistance around $2,800 to $2,900.
Projected Movement:

The chart suggests a potential bullish breakout from the falling wedge pattern. The arrow indicates a move upward toward the upper resistance zone near $2,800 if the breakout occurs.
A close above the resistance zone would confirm the breakout and could initiate a new bullish phase targeting higher levels.
Key Levels to Watch:

A close below the lower boundary of the wedge or the support zone could invalidate the bullish setup, leading to further downside. Conversely, a strong breakout above the wedge could signal a bullish reversal.
The current setup suggests watching for a confirmed breakout above the wedge for a long opportunity. If the price maintains support and breaks above resistance, there could be a significant upward movement towards higher targets.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.
Page5, Article 1: The resistance zone that has been holding Ethereum back from bullish movement has rejected one more time the price, leading to a nice 9% decline from there.

Swallow Team
Page5, Article 2: Here is the daily chart of Ethereum (ETH) against Tether (USDT), with a focus on a potential short scenario. The analysis based on the chart is as follows:

The chart shows a clear descending trend with lower highs and lower lows, indicating bearish momentum in the market.
The price is currently near a key support area of around $2,360, highlighted by the brown horizontal area. This support area has been tested multiple times and is crucial for the next price action.
 there is a resistance area near $2,800, which has previously acted as a supply area, which could potentially limit any immediate bullish rally.

A breakdown from a small ascending wedge or consolidation pattern appears, indicating further bearish pressure.
 The chart shows a possible rebound from the current support zone, but with overall bearish pressure, the broader movement may remain downward until the price breaks above the resistance.
 Below is a long-term ascending trendline, which could act as a key support level if the current support fails.

 the short-term scenario remains bearish, with a short-term bounce likely from current levels. However, the general bias suggests caution, as the breakdown from the recent consolidation points to a risk of continued declines unless key resistance levels are broken.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you.

Based on the analysis, Ethereum is projected to move towards a price of $2806.40, indicating a potential for significant price increase in this period.

This bullish trend suggests strong demand and possibly continued growth in the price within this timeframe.

Appreciate a like and follow if this analysis helps!

ETH is currently trading around $2400 level. It forms a symmetrical channel in the daily time frame and approaches towards the channel's lower trendline. 

As you see in the chart, it has a strong support of around $2100-$2300 level (Green Box). After we test this support, expecting a good bounce in quarter four of this year. 

All we need to survive the next 20-25 days patiently. After that, we will see a huge upside in the crypto market.

Page5, Article 13: I just made a bitcoin short idea and honestly after seeing Eth I have to make one for it as well. I am mixed between the 2. Eth looks cleaner for me and at a safer level compared to bitcoin right now. 

Bitcoin is still correcting its showing signs that it can give way any moment though

Am not gonna fomo though and get in too early. I would like my entry be a confident one at the end of this hour or a bit later.

When its ready and I enter I expect it to start melting right away with little to no draw down. There's no eth volume to support price right now on the weekend and it has lost major support levels.

Where I marked off on the chart for tp is where I anticipate that price could probably find some support.


Final verdict. I asked my younger which he like better eth or bitcoin and he says eth. And I agree. The RR will probable be bigger if bitcoin was to fall to $56000 or lower

at current price eth is roughly 8RR to $2250 and 16 RR to $2000

Time to lock. I'll post when I enter

Page5, Article 16: The crypto market never sleeps which means leaving your holdings stagnant could mean missing out on significant opportunities. 

So it‚Äôs time to ask yourself:

Are your assets maximizing their potential, or are they just gathering virtual dust?
You wouldn‚Äôt leave all your money in a low interest savings account, so why do it with your crypto?

The idea is to put your investments to work, so they keep earning returns without you lifting a finger. I‚Äôll walk you through exactly how to read it and use it to your advantage.

But that‚Äôs just the beginning, we‚Äôll also be covering:

-Yield strategies: A breakdown of the strategies we use to generate yield.
-Pros and cons: The advantages and drawbacks of each strategy.

Not sure what options are best for you?
Are you letting your capital sit idle? 
Worried about security risks? 

This analysis is about to change that .I‚Äôll show you how to maximize your returns and crush those security fears, so you can confidently put your assets to work

Let's dive right in and kick things off with the ‚Äòcrowd favorite‚Äô of yield strategies:  staking 

Staking is exclusive to Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains and their associated tokens.

Meaning you cannot gain staking yield from Bitcoin, for example, because it is a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain. by staking your tokens like  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  or  CRYPTOCAP:SOL , you receive a portion of newly minted tokens, effectively earning yield while playing a vital role in securing the network.

If you‚Äôre not staking, you could be missing out on significant gains, with potential returns ranging from 3% to 18% APY. that‚Äôs why many investors choose to stake their assets rather than let them sit idle



Staking has become a widely adopted strategy, with staking ratios (amount staked vs. unstaked) sitting between 20% and 80% on most POS blockchains In fact, a staggering $520 billion is currently staked across the top PoS blockchains, underscoring its popularity as a method for generating additional income.

Assuming an average 5% reward rate, that equates to $25 billion in staking rewards. That‚Äôs massive.

Despite the appeal of earning extra income through staking, becoming a solo staker can be technically challenging which is why staking providers like Lido, Rocket Pool, and Jito have emerged.

They handle network validation for the rest of us, while maximizing our staking yield. 

Let‚Äôs break down the pros and cons of using a staking provider:

Pros:

‚úÖ Security and efficiency: Our tokens are put to work securely and efficiently, contributing to the network‚Äôs security without us having to manage it all ourselves.

‚úÖ Maximized rewards: We earn the majority of staking rewards without needing to handle the technical complexities, making it a hassle-free way to generate income.

‚úÖ Liquidity retention: We receive liquid tokens as proof of our staked assets, allowing us to stay flexible and use them in other DeFi opportunities.

Cons:

 ‚ùå Fees: These providers typically charge a fee ranging from 8% to 25% for their validation services, which can slightly reduce your overall yield.

 ‚ùå Smart contract risks: There are inherent risks associated with smart contracts, such as bugs and/or vulnerabilities, that could potentially impact your staked assets. 

By weighing these pros and cons, you can decide whether outsourcing your staking through liquid staking providers is the right strategy for you.

Ok, so if that‚Äôs the case how do we go about choosing the right liquid staking provider?

Here are some key factors to consider when selecting a provider:

1/ Reputation and security

Track record: Look for providers with a solid track record and a strong reputation in the DeFi space. 

Security measures: Ensure the provider employs robust security measures, such as smart contract audits. 

 2/ Total volume locked

TVL: Check how much liquidity your chosen provider has attracted.

TVL is a quick and effective measure of the broader market's trust in a provider, as it reflects the total amount of assets currently staked or locked in their protocol, valued in dollars.

Feel free to use DefiLlama, which ranks all liquid staking providers by TVL.

Simply select the blockchain you‚Äôre interested in, and you‚Äôll see the top players in the space, giving you a clear view of where the most assets are being staked and which providers are leading the market. 

 3/ Yield rates

Competitive yields: Compare the staking yields offered by different providers. While higher yields are attractive, they should not come at the expense of security or reliability.

Fee structure: Be aware of the fee structure. Liquid staking providers typically charge a small fee for their services, which can impact your overall returns. 

 4/ Liquidity and flexibility

Liquid staking tokens (LSTs): Check if the liquid tokens issued by the provider are widely accepted across DeFi platforms and have enough liquidity. The more integration and liquidity these tokens have, the better.

Redemption options: Some providers offer instant or flexible redemption options for your staked tokens, which can be crucial if you need quick access to your assets. 

 5/ Decentralization and governance

Decentralization: Providers that are more decentralized tend to be more resilient to risks such as regulatory actions or central points of failure. 

Governance participation: Some providers offer governance rights with their tokens, allowing you to have a say in the protocol‚Äôs future direction. This can be an added benefit for those interested in being more involved in the ecosystem. 

 6/ Community and support

Active Community: A strong, active community can be a good indicator of a provider‚Äôs health and future prospects. Engage with the community to gauge the level of transparency and support. 

so while you trading and trying to maximize your gains Its good to stake some of your HODL bag as well

If Bitcoin will fall and at the same time its dominance will rise that's means we may see a strong downtrend in altcoins.

Ethereum has completed its Elliot 5 wave pattern from the bottom and and still in the correction waves. And I think a second wave Elliott correction is needed in the longer term uptrend.

Afterwards, I think 2025 could be a very good year the market and there might be a chance to sell at good prices in 2026.

Hello everyone,
Let's analyze ETHUSDT in weekly timeframe!!

ETHUSDT is currently forming a bullish pennant structure and maintaining strong trendline support. It is trading above the 200 MA, which is expected to act as a crucial support level.
RSI: Crossover in oversold zone.

There are two possible outcomes based on ETH price predictions:

Scenario 1:
ETH may bounce from the support range of $1996.59 to $2226.50, followed by an initial drop of approximately 7-10%.

Scenario 2:
ETH could break and fall through the upper support zone of $1996.59 to $2226.50 and decline toward the lower support zone of $1079.39 to $1251.48. A bounce from this lower support could occur only if ETH breaks the above zone, though this scenario is less likely due to the potential 50% decline from the current price, especially considering current market sentiment and cryptocurrency adoption trends.

BUYING ZONE:

Upper support zone:
$1996.59 to $2226.50

Lower support zone:
$1079.39 to $1251.48

Page6, Article 16: Hi everyone, 

I have been studying ICT lately and practicing into charts mainly BTC and ETH. Not yet trading with actual money tho, as I hit a wall in my trading journey couple of months ago and just started studying again. Hoping to get positive feedbacks as to my ICT knowledge from here on. 

ETH for daily chart,
as we can see here, ETH has been trading in the discount area for quite some time clearing FVGs in the lower time frame. The wick of today's candle bounced right into our displacement low and my invalidation area for bullish scenario. If we zoom out we can see that ETH has been forming lower highs recently that's why I placed my invalidation in that area. 

If we manage to clear past the range high, hoping we see ETH clear up also the SIBI in the Daily timeframe, then I feel very positive for ETH going in the upside. But first we need to clear the SIBI, at least enter in the equilibrium so it will feel a little more positive for ETH.

That's it everyone, kindly correct me if I am wrong as I am still in the learning process in my trading journey. üôÇ üìàüìàüìàüöÄ

Swallow Team
Page6, Article 19: Ethereum is under bearish pressure, with the amount of ETH sent to exchanges gradually increasing. This coincides with Ethereum facing strong resistance at the $2,750 price level. 

Currently trading below $2,500, Ethereum could see further declines if the selling pressure continues. Exchange reserves have risen, with 19 million ETH valued at $47 billion now held on exchanges. A significant drop in large holders‚Äô net flow, down 17% over the past 30 days and 36% in the past week, suggests that whales are reducing their positions. 

This trend is a bearish signal, as it often leads to retail investors following suit, potentially pushing ETH‚Äôs price down to $2,100. However, a resurgence in demand could push the price back up to $2,600.
Page6, Article 20: We have entered the liquidity zone and now Ethereum has shown a strong buying reaction. We are moving in a wide range, therefore, long entry at prices of 2300 with the goal of growth to 2600. After that, I think the fall to the values ‚Äã‚Äãof 2000 will continue

Page7, Article 1: $2,500 Zone has supported  CRYPTOCAP:ETH  many times.

This $2.5K zone is a saviour from Ethereum's fall. If this zone breaks, this baby may rally further south.

For now, we are likely to see positive move before breaking the current support zone.

Can the bull even ride it to $2400?
Page7, Article 2: On a daily timeframe, we are looking for that support zone where we had our last liquidity grab. 

This zone will decide the next major zone where breaking it would mean a nice Dowwnard movement breaking all lows here but seeing the price securing this zone we will see a bounce towards the 200EMA zone!

Page7, Article 6: ETH/USDT is currently trading at $2,448, down by 0.07%. On the 4-hour chart, ETH shows signs of weakness after breaking down from a rising wedge pattern, a bearish signal suggesting a potential downside. Immediate support is around $2,395, with a more significant support level near $2,165, where a long-term trendline may provide a strong base. Resistance is seen at $2,580, and a break above this could shift the trend back to bullish. However, failure to hold above support levels might push ETH towards lower zones, potentially targeting the $2,100 area. Watch for volume confirmation on any breakout attempts.

Note: This is not financial advice. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you!

üß†From a graphical perspective, we have an opportunity to form a descending triangle near the buy zone. Maybe we need to be more patient and wait for a breakthrough after the price is compressed to the extreme.

Stay Tuned for more updates
Page7, Article 10: Waiting for level confirmation Followed by correction 
At the moment, the ETH/USD trading situation is characterized by volatility, which is often seen in the cryptocurrency market. Ether (ETH) is at levels that can be both support and resistance, depending on current news and analytics. Investors are keeping a close eye on regulatory changes as well as the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, which could influence demand for Ether. Technical analysis shows some support and resistance levels where consolidation may occur. Market sentiment varies and traders are likely to continue to look for short and long term profit opportunities. It is important to keep in mind that changes in the global economy may also have an impact on the cryptocurrency market.
Page7, Article 11: You need to understand that most of the beautiful posts about the amazing life of a traders, airdrop hunters are complete nonsense and "fake it till you make it" life! Most people lose money in trading, and this applies not only to the crypto market! Therefore, on the channel we do not talk about stupid things like tothemoon, uponly, super-profitable meme tokens and other nonsense! Ask yourself the question, are you ready to quit your job and go into full-time trading or full-time work with cryptocurrency! These can be nodes, an accounts farm for airdrops, content creation, work in a crypto project, be the meme token degen, trading. 

A few key questions that you need to honestly ask yourself
1. Do you have a extra cash for several months, if, for example, the first six months, you will not be able to make a profit from cryptocurrency?
2. How old are you and what are your expenses? After all, the responsibility for income when you have a family and children is much bigger than when you are 20 years old and you can live peacefully with responsibility only for yourself!
3. Do you have enough experience for regular trading, do you have an understanding of the market, if, for example, we will trade in a downward trend for 2-3 years and investments will not be able to generate income, but only trading! Do you have a deposit to work with!? Lets be real! Start with 100$ and trade every day with x50 lev its not a good idea and plan! One day all this succesefull signal channels and traders just drawdown their accounts, but they got a lot of money from Discords, memecoins alllocations! So be real with initial deposit! 
4. How are things going with storing funds, diversification, risk management and money management! Do you have a strategy and a plan for what exactly you will do every day?
5. Do you have skills outside the market, what will you do if your plan does not work? Will you be able to quickly find a job to restore the deposit and try again
6. Are you mentally ready to work every day in this area now? After all, now you will have a lot of time, without a boss and a stable fixed payment at the end of the month! Do you know how to plan your day and work! Are you a disciplined and balanced person, because emotional decisions and trading on fear or greed can ruin your entire deposit!
7. Do you have a plan in case of a black swan in the world, a new pandemic, a financial collapse or abrupt regulation of cryptocurrency in your region!

Page7, Article 12: Fundamental analysis in the traditional financial markets involves evaluating a company's intrinsic value through a variety of metrics, such as earnings, revenue, and growth prospects. However, applying this same approach to cryptocurrency networks presents unique challenges. Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, and their value often stems from factors that don't align with conventional financial metrics.

Key Challenges:

Traditional Metrics Fall Short:

Cryptocurrency networks are not companies with revenues, profits, or physical assets. Therefore, traditional metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios or revenue growth don‚Äôt apply.

Misleading Social Media Data:

Social media presence and subscriber count might seem like indicators of a project‚Äôs popularity or potential, but these figures are easily manipulated. Fake followers, bots, and exaggerated engagement can create a false impression of legitimacy and success.

Isolated On-Chain Metrics:

While on-chain metrics provide valuable insights, they can be misleading if analyzed in isolation. For instance, a high number of active addresses might suggest widespread usage, but without context, it doesn't reveal whether these addresses represent genuine users or automated bots.

Relevant On-Chain Metrics:

Number of Transactions: Indicates the level of network activity, but doesn‚Äôt differentiate between meaningful transactions and spam.

Transaction Cost: Reflects the cost of using the network, which can indicate demand, but also congestion or inefficiency.

Active Addresses: Shows how many unique addresses are participating, but could be skewed by the creation of multiple addresses by a single entity.

Commissions (Fees): High fees might indicate network demand, but can also point to issues like scalability problems.

Hashrate or Coins in Staking: High hashrate or staking levels suggest network security and confidence, but can also centralize control if dominated by a few large players.

Design Indicators:

Whitepaper: This document outlines the project's goals, technology, and roadmap, but its value depends on the technical understanding of the reader and the honesty of the team.

Project Team: The experience and reputation of the team are crucial, but the anonymous or pseudonymous nature of many crypto projects complicates assessment.

Competitors: Understanding a project's competitors helps gauge its potential, but the fast-paced nature of the crypto space means that new competitors can emerge quickly.

Tokenomics: The economic model of the token, including supply, distribution, and incentives, is vital, but poorly designed tokenomics can lead to inflation or lack of demand.

Financial Indicators:

Capitalization: Market cap is often used as a quick measure of a project‚Äôs size and importance, but can be misleading in low-liquidity markets.

Liquidity: High liquidity indicates that an asset can be traded quickly without affecting its price, but low liquidity can lead to price manipulation.

Emission Method: The way tokens are issued (e.g., through mining, staking, or ICOs) affects supply dynamics, which can influence price stability and long-term viability.

In summary, while fundamental analysis in the crypto market is challenging, a multi-faceted approach combining on-chain metrics, design indicators, and financial indicators can offer valuable insights. However, these should always be interpreted with caution and in context, given the unique dynamics and rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape.

Page7, Article 13: hello guys.

 Resistance Zone:
 Price action has recently tested the resistance zone around $2,668-$2,715 (yellow shaded area), which aligns with a Fibonacci retracement level of 0.618. The price was unable to break above this resistance and has started to move downward.

 Bearish Trend Formation:
 A clear downtrend is forming as the price has failed to make a higher high and is now making lower lows. The downtrend is confirmed by the rejection from the resistance zone.

 Fibonacci Retracement Levels:
 The chart uses Fibonacci levels to highlight potential support and resistance areas. Key levels to watch:
0.382 retracement at around $2,455.94
0.618 retracement at around $2,395.78 (next target zone)

 Key Support Levels:
 The next significant support level is around $2,366 (highlighted by the yellow zone at the bottom). If the price continues its downward movement, this area may serve as a potential buying opportunity or a target for short positions.

 Potential Trading Strategy:
 The bearish momentum suggests considering a short position with a target near the $2,366 support zone. A stop-loss could be placed above the recent high at $2,668 to manage risk.

 Market Outlook:
 Bearish in the short term as the price is likely to continue declining towards the next key support level.

 Overall, the chart suggests a bearish trend with a potential downside target around $2,366 if the current support level fails to hold.

üß†The current market is still in a shock stage, moving back and forth between the resistance zone and the buying zone. We are now in the red selling zone and relatively close to the resistance zone above, so chasing the rise is unreasonable. From a pattern perspective, we have the opportunity to form an ascending triangle here, and if we continue to break upward, we can try to place some short orders after reaching the resistance zone.

Page8, Article 4: ETH has been trading inside this channel for over two years now. After the recent touch of the support, the support has solidified itself even further. Note that the support is a more clear-cut line, while the resistance is more an area.

Another touch of the bottom support would potentially be great news for the bulls, hence the signal on the chart. Seeing that we already touched it recently, we can use the wick as a clear stop level. Target placed at the top of the channel, $5000. This will create a great trade with a RR of 8.5.

Keep in mind that the support could potentially also break down. This would indicate a long-term bearish shift in trend.

Page8, Article 13: BINANCE:ETHUSDT  is clearly in the accumulation phase, sitting just below the psychological level of 3000. Recently, the price hit a support level that was also tested back in February and subsequently bounced off it. Over the past three weeks, we've observed mostly sideways movement. When examining the weekly timeframe, it's evident that the market formed a long-tailed bar, indicating a liquidity grab below the February low. This suggests that there was strong buying interest after the dip. Given that the market has retested the recent low area and rebounded, I believe we can expect a gradual upward movement from here. My target is resistance zone around 2950.

ETH is holding decent support within the $2,184-$2,348 range. A few weeks ago, when the market experienced a major correction, ETH dropped to this same support range and bounced back.

With the price currently at $2,520, ETH is likely to test the 35 EMA resistance. If it closes above the 35 EMA, a rally toward the upper resistance at $3,750 is possible.

The RSI has rebounded from the oversold zone, and bullish momentum is building.

Key levels:

- Support Range: $2,184-$2,348.
- Primary Resistance: $2,930.
- Higher Target: $3,750.

Page8, Article 18: Trade setup : Price broke below its 200-day moving average, which signaled downtrend. It bounced off $2,100 support and reached $2,800 resistance where it got rejected. Momentum is fading (MACD Histogram declining ). We would be buyers if price dips to $2,100 support again. The recent launch of nine ETH Spot ETFs could also boost demand for ETH. Learn to trade chart patterns in Lesson 8 and set Stop Loss levels in Lesson 9.

 Pattern : Price is Approaching Support, which is a level where it could pause or reverse its recent decline, at least temporarily. Support is often a level where price has bounced up in the past, or potentially prior Resistance level that was broken. (concept known as polarity). Once price breaks below support, it can move lower to the next support level. Learn to trade key levels in Lesson 7.

 Trend : Short-term trend is Strong Down, Medium-term trend is Strong Down and Long-term trend is Strong Down.

 Momentum  is Bullish but inflecting. MACD Line is still above MACD Signal Line but momentum may have peaked since MACD Histogram bars are declining, which suggests that momentum could be nearing a downswing. Price is neither overbought nor oversold currently, based on RSI-14 levels (RSI > 30 and RSI < 70).

 Support and Resistance : Nearest Support Zone is $2,400.00, then $2,100.00. Nearest Resistance Zone is $2,620.00, then $2,850.00.
Page8, Article 19: The price of Ethereum broke below the support at $2500, which revived the possibility of a restest of the next support at $2200. Therefore, a structural higher low is going to form in a deep value zone following a breakdown from the rising wedge. The bulls have halted the bearish trend with a reversal above $2500 while the next price action remains uncertain. If the bulls maintain a healthy upswing, a rise above $2700 may elevate the levels to $3000. As the crypto winters are about to begin, the bullish probability remains within a limited range. 

Therefore, if the price loses the current support zone between $2350 and $2416, then a drop close to $2000 could be imminent. This move may attract the required liquidity, which may revive a strong ascending trend. 

The ETH price is still trading above the EMA 50 support level in the longer time frame and hence there could be a possibility of a price capitulation. Therefore, the sluggish phase is expected to go on where the price may continue its trade within a narrow range. Hence, the Ethereum (ETH) price is believed to maintain a range-bound trade for a few more weeks, which may result in a bullish breakout beyond $3000.

Page9, Article 4: The Spot ETFs is always a bullish development. Crypto is growing, the market is expanding and is being accepted all across the world. This is good and we love it.

The effect these "financial vehicles" have on the market is a completely different monster.

The effect is surely bullish, long-term, but on the short-term things can be different.

You know, this is a business. In business, when you buy large quantities of anything, usually you tend to get a big discount.

The institutions want crypto, the giants want Ether and they want billions of it. There is a catch though, they are willing to pay only around $1,000 to $1,200 for each ETH and this they say is still a big price.

Long story short, these giant institutions bought billions of dollars worth of Ether and this will soon reflect on the price.

The chart says a support range of $1500 - $1750 as the next support, but, knowing that they paid around $1,100 per ETH God only knows how far down the price will actually go.

Namaste.
Page9, Article 5: BINANCE:ETHUSD  ETH is consolidating in front of strong resistance. Bulls do not let the price down beyond 0.5 fibo. amid Friday's news, the cryptocurrency market is reviving and ETH has high chances to pass through 2800. 

  

A false breakout of the resistance of the range is formed, but instead of falling, the coin is consolidating, which is generally one of the pre-breakout nuances. Technically, it would be an ideal condition for me to wait for a prolonged consolidation near 2780-2800 followed by a price advance towards the zone with a breakout target. The liquidation that took place earlier rid the market of an unnecessary part of speculators, after which the whales went into an active accumulation phase, now ETH shows positive preconditions of readiness to go to the intermediate high and resistance of the global range. 

 Support levels: 2717, 0.5 fibo
Resistance levels: 2780, 2817 

The market is bullish, as evidenced by some indicators, technical indicators on the chart, as well as the fundamental background. Accordingly, in the mid-term I expect the price to come out of the consolidation 2780 - 2550 and most likely this exit will be accompanied by a breakout of resistance and growth to 3300.

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:ETHUSD   ;)

Page9, Article 6: Ethereum corrected itself after nearing 4000. 2000 is the newly created base support . If the current bull run continues it will most likely reach 5000 in the long run. It might take quite some time but entering near 2000 area and having stop below 2000 would be the safe bet. The monthly wave indicator is still in the bull run zone and it has not confirmed the bull run is over .
Page9, Article 7: Ethereum has broken a flip range to the bottom and is now pulling back towards this area.

Also, Ethereum's structure is bearish in large timeframes.

We are looking for sell/short positions in the POI range.

The targets are marked on the chart.

Closing a daily candle above the invalidation level will violate the analysis.

For risk management, please don't forget stop loss and capital management
When we reach the first target, save some profit and then change the stop to entry
Comment if you have any questions
Thank You
Page9, Article 8: After a rough sell-off last week the market seems to get stabilized. 

Both  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  and  BINANCE:ETHUSDT  are setting up for a new buy point. 

For  BINANCE:BTCUSDT , you can see the idea in the related ideas section. 

For  BINANCE:ETHUSDT , I am expecting it will cross up the resistance $2730 and I placed a buy stop order at this price level.

Page9, Article 10: Hello TradingView Family / Fellow Traders. This is Richard, also known as theSignalyst.

 üìàETH has been overall bullish,  trading inside the flat rising channel in orange.

Moreover, ETH is approaching a massive round number $2500.

üèπ The highlighted blue circle is a strong area to look for buy setups as it is the intersection of the $2500 and lower orange trendline acting as a non-horizontal support.

 üìö As per my trading style: 
As #ETH approaches the blue circle zone, I will be looking for bullish reversal setups (like a double bottom pattern, trendline break , and so on...)

 üìö Always follow your trading plan regarding entry, risk management, and trade management.

Good luck!

All Strategies Are Good; If Managed Properly!

Page9, Article 11: Very tough Support in the last daily low will pump it to the last top resistance. This idea is totally depends on BTC behavior.
Page9, Article 12: Ethereum bounced off the ascending trendline and bounced off the support level. Bullish movement to resistance level at 2780 is expected to happen.
Page9, Article 13: This coin has ben assessed on a hourly chart making a bearish divergence near the resistance zone of a daily time frame. It is making a double top which is a reversal pattern. The chart might go sideways or start its downward trend. I have placed a pending order of a sell stop at the breakout a double top's neckline.

The Signal is:
EP: 2734.99 
SL: 2790.36
TP: 2679.62
Page9, Article 14: Etherium long position from 2590$.
There is a nice retest of a broken trendline.
Waiting for the retest and then things will look better.
Page9, Article 15: It looks like ETH is making an attempt to push towards ~3k coming days/next week. Alts are performing pretty decent as well, which is what you want to see for bullish continuation - An overall strong market, not just BTC, so I'm giving this a high chance.

As I said in my BTC analyis, 61k is the level to hold for BTC for the next 2-3 days, for ETH this level would be ~2.7k.

Key level for ETH is around 3.2k (monthy open), if we see this month close above this level, it's a matter of time until we see ETH picking up momentum again heading into september. 

3.6k should be a tough nut to break and we could see a higher low around ~3k before going up much higher. So ideally you want to see ETH forming higher lows from now on but once it gets back above 2.8k this would aready be my invalidation level (on a daily close that is). 

Still believe ETH is primed for 5-6k+ this year but it will likely be the last leg of this bull market. Don't dare to predict when it's going to happen, but it will surely take another 2-3 months. 

So as a trader you basically just let your positions ride at this point. Any entry below 2.8k is quite decent, so don't worry if you didn't catch the bottom of the flush we saw few weeks ago. 

Stay safe!
Page9, Article 16: ETHUSDT.P daily timeframe prediction + description


1. **Elliott Wave Structure**:
   - The chart illustrates a **5-wave impulse pattern** (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) marked with green lines. This pattern typically represents a strong directional move in the market, either up or down.
   - Following the 5-wave impulse, there is a **3-wave corrective pattern** (labeled A, B, C) marked with red lines. This corrective pattern is a common structure where the market retraces a portion of the previous impulse move.

2. **Fibonacci Extension Levels**:
   - The chart has two key Fibonacci levels highlighted: **0.618** and **0.5**.
   - The **0.618 to 0.5 Fibonacci extension level** is located from around 2560 to around 2458.

3. **Equilibrium and Take Profit (TP)**:
   - An "Equilibrium" level is marked on the chart, representing a significant horizontal price level where the market might find balance.
   - A "75% TP" level is indicated at 2819.17, which is a suggested price target where a trader might take profit on their position.

4. **Price Action**:
   - The current market price is shown between the labeled points A, B, and C, with the red lines connecting these points indicating the ongoing ABC corrective wave.

### Prediction (ABC Correction):
The Idea is predicting that the market is currently in an **ABC corrective phase** following a significant 5-wave impulse move downwards. Here‚Äôs the detailed description:

1. **Wave A** represents the first corrective move upward after the 5-wave downward impulse.
2. **Wave B** is the subsequent move downward, representing a partial retracement of Wave A.
3. **Wave C** is the final move in the correction, expected to move upward again and typically reaching or slightly exceeding the end of Wave A.

### Specific Prediction Based on the Chart:
- The prediction indicates that the price will likely continue upward from the current level, aiming to complete the **C wave** of the ABC correction.
- **Wave C** is expected to reach around the **0.618 Fibonacci extension level**, which is marked as a significant resistance point.
- Once Wave C is completed, this could signify the end of the correction phase and potentially the resumption of the previous trend (either continuing downwards or reversing to the upside, depending on broader market conditions).

This type of analysis is used by traders to anticipate market movements and make informed decisions on entering or exiting positions based on the likelihood of these patterns playing out as predicted.

the last TP: 3011
entry: 2550
SL: 2367

A slight pullback might be expected before wave C and notice that this might not be in the next few days or weeks, the date is not fixed.
Page9, Article 17: CRYPTOCAP:ETH  is looking more bearish than $BTC. Still struggling to break resistance. If  AMEX:BTC  makes another impulse downward after being rejected from 70k again, expect ETH to test 2k or even lower.
Page9, Article 18: After seeing the reaction of Asia making a new low and seeing that London has just made a new low I had marked a buy order in the middle of the 4H FVG as if it was respected it would be a great opportunity to continue rising until the next bullish 4H FVG.  BINANCE:ETHUSDT
Page9, Article 19: Although Ethereum showed some strength during the latest market pump, the token didn't clear essential levels.

On the contrary, ETH was rejected at the significant 2.8k resistance and the 4H EMA200.

Currently, ETH is struggling to stay above its sideways channel trendline. A close below this trendline on the daily chart would put us back where we came from. 

Moreover, the 2.5k level would return to the play in this case.

Volume continues to be relatively low ‚Äî especially in the context of a significant breakout.

Therefore, the story remains the same: As long as ETH trades below 2.8k, long trade entries don't make sense.
Page9, Article 20: Hi everyone, in my analysis ETH will break through resistance this week and rise to 3,000 ++

Note : Please follow your strategy, this is just my idea and i will gladly see your ideas in this post.

Don't forget to put STOP LOSS for your position, remember STOP LOSS is the key of consistency trading for long term.

üò±When I woke up, I found that my position had decreased. It turned out that the profit was automatically stopped after reaching the target  ü•≥

üß†From a structural perspective, we have a bearish head and shoulders structure built near the resistance zone, but I am not prepared to participate in this short opportunity just yet because there is a larger level bull structure present. Moreover, it is very close to the 2694 support area, the inflection point below, so short selling is not cost-effective.

‚ö†Ô∏èNote that the long orders we held near 2660 have been swept away after moving up SL. I will wait for new signals to appear before considering setting up new transactions‚òïÔ∏è

(ETHUSDT 1D chart)

The key is whether the price can rise above 2851.75 to break out of the short-term downtrend channel.

-
Currently, it has risen above the M-Signal indicator on the 1M chart.

Therefore, from a long-term perspective, it is possible that the uptrend will continue.

However, in order for a full-scale uptrend to begin, the M-Signal on the 1D chart > M-Signal on the 1W chart > M-Signal on the 1M chart must be in that state.

Therefore, we need to see if it can maintain the price by rising above the M-Signal indicator on the 1W chart after the volatility period around September 8th.

-
Since the StochRSI indicator is currently in the overbought zone, it is important at what point it finds support when the StochRSI indicator falls from the overbought zone and becomes StochRSI < StochRSI EMA.

Therefore, if it fails to rise above 2851.75 and falls, it is important to see if it can find support around 2621.99-2700.43.

If it finds support around 2621.99-2700.43 and switches to the state of StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, it is expected to lead to an attempt to rise above 2851.75.

-
If the M-Signal indicator of the 1W chart rises above, the HA-High indicator (3265.00) of the 1W chart and the HA-High indicator (3321.30) of the 1M chart are likely to be the first resistance zones.

-
The volatility period on the BTCUSDT chart is around September 13.

However, the volatility period on the ETHUSDT chart is expected to start around September 8.

Therefore, the key is whether it can escape the short-term downtrend channel after September 8.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin after rising above 29K.

The area expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.

‚û°Ô∏èWe started to fall back after being blocked by the resistance area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe two necklines (2805-2813) again. This is very reasonable. The support area that can be seen currently is around 2700-2730.

‚û°Ô∏èIf we develop as expected, then after reaching the most ideal target area of ‚Äã‚Äã2880-3000, we will close the long orders we hold and then look for short selling opportunities.

üß†We placed some long orders after breaking the key watershed downtrend line and saw a nice move up. From a structural perspective, a bullish cup-and-handle structure has been established, and there is still room for continued gains in the future.

‚û°Ô∏èHowever, after we broke through the previous high, we encountered the resistance of two necklines (2805-2813), so we need to be wary of the risk of a correction. Even if we want to participate in new long transactions, we should wait patiently for a period of correction before considering it.

‚û°Ô∏èUnfortunately, there was only a US$1 difference from our TP2 and the automatic reduction was not triggered, so we manually reduced our position by 30% and only retained 20% of our position. We are patiently looking forward to more.

Page10, Article 19: Current Situation:
Ethereum's daily chart remains unchanged as the price consolidates within its current range. The longer this consolidation continues, the larger the anticipated breakout could be.

Trade Position:
Currently positioned long on ETH, but traders should be cautious of a potential stop-hunt that might trigger a flush to the downside before the significant move occurs.

Key Level to Watch:

Support Level: $2,350 ‚Äì This is the critical area to monitor if a downside flush happens.
Stay vigilant and prepared for potential volatility as the consolidation phase unfolds.

Page10, Article 20: Market activity for Ethereum (ETH) has been subdued, showing only a slight increase of 2.45% in price, now trading around the $2,600 level.

This kind of price behavior is typical when an asset is trading within a symmetrical triangle‚Äîa pattern characterized by converging diagonal upper and lower lines.

Previous instances of such trading patterns have often led to significant price movements, either upwards or downwards.

Momentum among Ethereum traders is increasing, as indicated by the Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD). 

This tool tracks the relationship between two moving averages of ETH‚Äôs price, helping to spot changes in momentum and direction. 

Recently, the MACD signaled a bullish crossover, suggesting that buyers are actively entering the market and may continue to push the price upward.

Additionally, Ethereum‚Äôs momentum has been on the rise, with the MACD trending toward positive territory. This suggests a strong likelihood of continued price increases.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also supports this bullish outlook. It has been rising since the 18th of August, indicating that buying pressure was mounting. 

If this trend persists, it could further propel ETH‚Äôs price higher to the $2,800 target.
Page10, Article 21: üìä#ETH is blocked by the downward trendline‚ùå

üß†Recently, ETH has been consolidating sideways since it reached the resistance zone. The differences are relatively large, the trend is not good-looking, and it is not standard, so I rarely pay attention to it. Only when we get out of this divergence area will trading become easier.

‚û°Ô∏èThe key watershed that can be seen at present is the downward trend line. Today is the third test. If it cannot successfully break through, then I hope to see the price move back to the buying zone below.
