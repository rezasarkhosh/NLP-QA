traders. follow always get new information quickly. please also click boost. nice day today. im publishing advance schedule. content explanation part necessary understanding chart. therefore dont necessarily read want use chart indicator refer explanation often give like this. lets summarize current chart content. current important support area 61099-25 rising 1st 63118-6264000-0 2nd 65920-7167614-25 1st 2nd areas correspond support resistance areas. among next important point 61099-25 65920-7167614-25. falls 61099-25 1st 57889-1059053-55 2nd 56150-0156950-56 1st 2nd areas support resistance zones. moves according previous flow expected trend determined rising around 65920-71. however since stochrsi indicator shows signs entering overbought zone need check point supported falls overbought zone. therefore need look stochrsi indicator initialized. one actually knows future trend be. however guess based current movement respond accordingly. therefore necessary objectively observe kind movement chart showing. however since candlestick charts commonly see volatility exposed likely difficult analyze interpret chart. therefore necessary exclude elements fakes sweeps movement candles. think renko chart good chart use. renko 1d chart think know support resistance points current trend without explaining separately. let explain little more. falls 56000 new downtrend likely form. since currently moving sideways 5600070000 range likely uptrend begin rises 70000. roughly explained important areas current price position. need create trading strategy based whether support support resistance points easy check whether support. therefore supplement utilize bw indicator stochrsi indicator. bw indicator included tsbw indicator indicator comprehensively evaluates displays stochrsi macd cci pvt supertrend indicators. therefore lowest point 0 judged low point section formed look place buy. confirm quickly made bw line drawn near price candle. hand highest point 100 judge high point section formed look place sell. similar principle bw indicator utilize stochrsi indicator. words stochrsi indicator rises oversold section look place buy falls overbought section look place sell. talked lot utilize stochrsi indicator would appreciate could refer previous idea. btcusdt 1d chart actually dont need draw separate trend line chart. however many people look trend line check trend pattern according drew it. judged necessary select volatility period trend line drawn. since btc eth charts occupy large portion coin market draw trend line select volatility period inform you. trend confirmed mssignal indicator. mssignal indicator consists msignal line ssignal line. therefore current trend determined based arrangement msignal lines 1m 1w 1d charts. msignal 1d chart msignal 1w chart msignal 1m chart considered fullblown uptrend. msignal 1d chart msignal 1w chart msignal 1m chart considered fullblown downtrend. since msignal 1w chart msignal 1d chart msignal 1m chart interpreted maintaining uptrend long term showing downtrend short medium term. therefore whether uptrend maintained switching msignal 1d chart msignal 1w chart important issue trend perspective. confirmed trend check happens trading period create trading strategy accordingly. therefore first need find trading period. utilize halow hahigh indicators hams indicator. halow indicator generated breaks low range. therefore falls halow indicator likely show stepwise downtrend receives support section buy. hahigh indicator generated breaks high range. therefore rises hahigh indicator likely show stepwise uptrend receives resistance section sell. therefore narrower gap halow hahigh indicators higher possibility large volatility. words check convergence divergence. confirmed trading period halow hahigh indicators need support resistance points create actual trading strategy. used several auxiliary indicators draw horizontal lines. distinguish strength support resistance roles based length horizontal lines. however need draw support resistance lines 1m 1w 1d charts. talk support resistance lines 1d chart explanation. points currently performing strongest support resistance roles chart 69499-85 68393-48 58697-01. next important points 64179-08 57889-10 56022-01. create trading strategy selecting support resistance low points like this. chart shows support resistance points drawn 1m 1w 1d charts. may differences points explained support resistance points actual charts used. reason selected based importance support resistance points. importance support resistance points order 1m 1w 1d charts. therefore support resistance lines 1w 1d charts near support resistance lines drawn 1m chart replaced support resistance lines drawn 1m chart. bw line drawn point arrow pointing. bw line line drawn highest point 100 corresponds high point section. however since stochrsi indicator yet clearly reentered overbought zone interpreted additional increases taking place. therefore stochrsi indicator rises overbought zone tries fall overbought zone check whether supported near bw line. rises 61099-25 1st 63118-6264000-0 2nd 65920-7167614-25 1st 2nd areas correspond support resistance zones. look increase breaking sell line seems risen 89%.  therefore shows increase time well expected touch around 65920-71. 65920-71 point important point hahigh indicator point 1w chart. 67614-25 point hahigh indicator point 1d chart. therefore see order stepwise uptrend begin must rise 67614-25. 61099-25 point hahigh indicator point 1m chart section must supported order stepwise uptrend begin longterm perspective. nice time. thank you.

guys without ado let’s dive right main content. short believe bitcoin positioned price increase. i’ll explain outlook three key arguments starting first one. reason 1. i’ve applied bollinger bands bitcoin’s daily chart. currently price rebounding touching lower band. support resistance often occur upper lower bands bollinger bands. case price first hit upper band followed touch lower band—typically precursor rebound. let’s verify historical examples. example 1. chart january 2024. time price followed similar pattern first hitting upper band touching lower band. following price rebounded sharply eventually hit new alltime high. example 2. take look chart february 2023. price touched upper band followed lower band saw four consecutive green candles afterward leading significant rally. example 3. chart february 2022. despite prevailing downtrend witnessed technical bounce price touched upper band dropped lower band. significant rebound followed even midst bearish market conditions. let’s shift back current chart. reason 2. next lets take look rising channel formed three critical points. find channel quite interesting. focusing half line consistently provided clear support resistance levels. recently saw price rejected channel reinforces reliability. however price currently broken channel. manages rebound reenter could witness significant upward movement. pattern commonly referred trap frequent occurrence technical analysis. example 1. chart december 2023. rising channel based three key points. sharp drop price broke channel quickly recovered forming trap pattern rising opposite end channel. example 2. take look chart march 2024. see rising channel formed three key points. ten consecutive green candles price hit peak dropped. despite breaking channel price quickly recovered forming another trap pattern continued rise holding middle line channel. example 3. here’s chart november 2023. rising channel formed connecting lower trendline peak. price drop price broke lower trendline forcing many retail investors exit positions. however price soon rebounded eventually broke channel upside. time trap pattern appeared twice triggering multiple exits market. reason 3. third reason involves 3 market phases pattern. pattern typically unfolds three distinct stages contraction expansion profit taking. first contraction occurs stabilizes price range makes investors feel comfortable. next expansion phase kicks causing volatility confusion often leading investors get stopped out. finally profit taking phase occurs sparking fomo fear missing sentiment among investors price moves rapidly. pattern often leveraged market manipulators shake retail investors larger price movement. let’s take look past examples see action. example 1. here’s chart january 2024. showcases textbook example 3 market phases contraction stabilized price range expansion created volatility confusion profit taking resulted strong uptrend. example 2. here’s chart june 2023. see classic case 3 market phases pattern. expansion phase price breached upper lower bounds forcing retail investors stop out. followed strong directional trend. first reason bollinger bands second reason channel third reason 3 market phases final conclusion today’s post anticipating significant upward move. long three reasons mentioned today remain valid remain confident bullish setup. historically highprobability scenario personally plan take long position. thank reading found analysis helpful please consider giving boost following future updates. buy sell recommendation. personal perspective used reference only. decisions responsibilities lie you.
