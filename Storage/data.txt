Page 1, Article 1: ‚û°Ô∏èBitcoin is heading for a massive bear market in 2024/2025! If you are new to crypto, you may miss information about usual Bitcoin volatility; precisely, Bitcoin crashes by 80% - 90% every 3rd year. Of course this is not natural, it's caused by tremendous manipulation by Cabal (banks, governments, world's organizations (WEF, WHO, etc...). They all work together while giving you an illusion. Of course their goal is to enslave humans with nanotechnologies, artificial intelligence, a neurolink from Elon Musk (that will be connected to your brain), a credit score system, and 1 world digital currency (Bitcoin), forced jabs, etc... All these technologies are completely incompatible with the human body and cause massive depression, anxiety and cancer. In today's world, we can already see how many people are in a depression state by these technologies.

‚û°Ô∏èThey will not tell you that every human naturally possesses strong abilities, such as Telekinesis (move objects with your mind) or Telepathy (you don't really need to use your phone to communicate over long distances). There are natural abilities that every human can do without exception. And I don't want to talk about magic powers, leaving your physical body during sleep (astral travel) or meditation, maybe in the next post. These are abilities the Cabal doesn't want you to use.

‚û°Ô∏èOn the weekly chart, we can see that Bitcoin is heading downward, I expect 28k to be hit in 2025. Of course markets move in waves, and we have many minor levels on the way down. We have the 100 and 200 weekly moving averages at the same place, 0.382 FIB retracement, fair value gaps, and 0.618 FIB retracement. I will keep you updated once we reach these important levels!

Page 1, Article 3: My fellow traders, here we have a classic bearish chart setup.

‚ûñ Bitcoin has been consolidation with a bearish bias now for six months straight; it has been printing lower highs.

‚ûñ Volume has been dominant on the bearish side and the BTC side of the Altcoins market is decidedly bullish. These signals are telling us that Bitcoin is likely to move down next; another leg down.

‚ûñ This move can develop within the next 3-14 days, thus making this a timing trade. Potentially, a "great entry timing."

I am wishing you profits and good luck.

Page 1, Article 4: Bitcoin is going to hit $100,000 in 2025... I am going to breakdown how everything will develop in a few minutes.

How are you feeling in this beautiful Saturday/Sunday?

The correction is not yet over. When the correction is over we will have bullish action, of course, but bullish action doesn't mean straight up, it simply means higher highs and higher lows. There will be fluctuations, shakeouts, swings and all types of market moves in-between.

The correction bottom comes in and growth immediately follows for a month or two and then another drop. This drop can end in a higher low or lower low (around November), makes no difference. After this drop we enter the accumulation phase and things will slow down.

While Bitcoin moves slowly, slow and steady growth, these Altcoins that I've been sharing now will have their best period in some 4, 5, 6 years.

December 2024, January and February 2025 Bitcoin will be slow but still higher, moving up, recovering. Full speed starts to develop right after February, at the beginning of March 2025. We can say it will take some time to break resistance, the barriers, and so after March/April 2025 we can see the light and we are now aiming toward $100,000. I don't know if it will hit right on April or May or later down the road, but it will take a while.

In short, Bitcoin is likely to hit $100,000 after March 2025.

All the period before this date the Altcoins will shine. The Altcoins will shine because Bitcoin will be growing slowly, kind of sideways; bullish accumulation/consolidation. It will be obvious that the 2024 corrective phase is a thing of the past and everybody will be preparing for the new All-Time High in the latter part of 2025.

We are likely to get a blow-off top in 2025. Not like 2021 but more like 2017. Remember this.

The numbers are pointing toward 190,000 as the top but we will have to add inflation and God knows about market hype. So it can go to 220,000 if things go great.

If things go bad, for whatever reason, we can peak around 150K.

Sounds good?

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.
Page 1, Article 5: BINANCE:BTCUSDT  is strengthening after a false breakdown of the 54.5K - 55K support. Fundamentally and technically, there is no buyer motivation. Traders have moved into the waiting or selling phase...

  

Now BTC is accumulated mainly by wallets with balance < 1BTC... Larger wallets are not doing much. Also, judging by the statistics of various services it can be seen that the trading activity of large investors has decreased, and whales have stopped actively accumulating since August. Traders doubt the current rebound in BTC and continue to actively short it.
Technically, the coin shows negative, bearish dynamics, forming gradually declining highs without the possibility to approach the retest of local peaks.
For the last one and a half or two months a tight sideways range has been formed and MM continues to keep the price inside the flat, it is also worth paying attention to the descending resistance, which also prevents the market from going up, putting pressure together with SMA-200.

 Resistance Levels: SMA200, 59600, Trend Line
Support levels: 57736, 56K, 54500 

At the moment the price is consolidating in the bullish zone, which indicates a possible chance to rise to 59600. The situation may end with a short-squeeze and further decline after liquidity capture. The pressure from sellers continues and buyers are not ready yet

Page 1, Article 8: üì£Despite the recent decline in Bitcoin's price, "Michael Saylor", a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency market, continues to advocate for holding onto Bitcoin. This comes as some analysts, citing recent US employment data, anticipate a potential interest rate cut by the "Federal Reserve", which could drive up riskier assets like Bitcoin. In this analysis, we will delve into the technical reasons supporting this viewüëáüëáüëá

üî•#Bitcoin / ‚è±Daily Timeframe
üìå#Bitcoin failed to reach above the bearish channel on the weekly timeframe during its previous bull-trend.

üîªSubsequently, it has retested the channel's bottom with the recent decline.

üöÄAs a result, there is potential for growth based on a double bottom pattern and a triple divergence, targeting the channel's upper boundary.

‚úÖThis rally could initiate from the current channel bottom or the support zone of $49,000.00 - $50,096.10.

‚ö†Ô∏èIf it rallies from the channel bottom and reaches the first target of $57,877.90, a pullback to retest the second support zone is likely before a substantial uptrend resumes‚ÄºÔ∏è

üôÖRegardless, a breakout above the first target ($57,877.90), which is a crucial resistance level on the daily timeframe, is essential for the uptrend to continue‚úÖüöÄ

üéØSubsequent targets include:
üöÄTarget 2: $66,755.85
üöÄüöÄTarget 3: $74,537.70

‚ùåThe stop-loss for the bullish scenario is a breakout below the bearish channel and a daily candle close below $49,000.00 on the weekly timeframe.

üîÑIn this case, the trend would shift from bullish to bearish, potentially targeting $41,218.20 and then $34,494.20üëÜüëá

‚úÖOn the monthly chart, #Bitcoin is showing signs of forming a flag pattern, which could signal a substantial price increase. 

‚ÅâÔ∏èHowever, for this bullish scenario to play out, the price needs to break above the flag pattern on the monthly timeframe. 

‚úÖIf this occurs, #Bitcoin could potentially rally to around $155,000üöÄüöÄüéØüí∞
Page 1, Article 9: Hello traders,

Bitcoin price tested 53k support area again and currently is in a correction phase.

I expect BTC price to trade in the range between 53k and 61k before 18th September when the FED expected to cut rates. 
After that event all markets might plunge in the short term but in the long term this should be bullish.
Considering all this, it's highly important for Bitcoin price to hold above the 50k area in the short term before all markets will start to recover.

Will Bitcoin manage to hold a 50k support area is another question but if it fails to do so then we might see BTC reaching 47k or even 42k areas. 
But in any case I don't expect the price to stay at those levels for too long as it is more likely to recover quickly.

Please, do not forget to boost this idea and leave your comments below, thanks.
Page 1, Article 10: Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. Some days ago price declined to the resistance level, which coincided with the resistance zone, and at once rebounded up to the trend line. After this, BTC turned around and made a strong impulse down, breaking 63900 with 53200 levels, but soon turned around again and rose higher than the 53200 level, making a fake breakout of it. Next, the price started to grow and later it grew almost to a resistance level, where it some time traded. Then the price rose to the resistance zone, where it touched the trend line one more time and then started to decline. In a short time, BTC fell to the support level, which coincided with the support zone, and a not long time ago it rebounded and started to move up. So, in my mind, I expect that BTCUSDT will make little correction movement and continue to grow to the trend line. For this case, I set two goals, first at the - 57400 points, and second at the 60600 points, which coincides with the trend line.

 ‚ö†Ô∏èThings can change... 
The markets are always changing and even with all these signals, the market changes tend to be strong and fast!!
Page 1, Article 12: I wasn't even looking at Bitcoin but opened this chart to check some numbers in relation to ETCBTC, which is ultra-bullish right now and what do I see?

Bitcoin just lost ALL support on the weekly timeframe.

There is only the wick from the 5-Aug. week that's been lower since February. Bearish bias, bearish potential, bearish continuation confirmed for the 300th time.

What is happening is nothing new. This is something that has been in the making for the past six months. Bitcoin gave the first massive, impossible to ignore signal on the 5th of March, six months ago, with the highest bearish volume session on the daily timeframe in years.

The action has been bearish, sideways, down, lower highs and lower lows... The chart tells us the tendency, the market will make up the event that will be the catalyst that produces the crash that we've been seeing developing for so long.

‚ûñ What to make of this situation?
‚ûñ Where do go we from here?
‚ûñ What about Crypto?

This is a positive situation. We are seeing the natural workings of the market first hand. The market grows and shrinks. Money flowing out of Bitcoin will reach other portions of the market and all is well. Everything is as it should be and life is good.

From here, we move to the Altcoins. We enjoy the Altcoins and profit from their rise as Bitcoin crashes. When Bitcoin hits bottom, we can either move back to Bitcoin or continue with the Altcoins, but, when the bottom is hit, the opportunity to buy again presents itself. Better prices, more people, new participants will join. All the gambling, all the weak-hands, all these things will be "corrected," erased, removed from the market and only those that are ready for the long-term will stay in the game. This is again positive, there has always been corrections and corrections will continue to exist for as long as we humans live in a world of duality with good and bad, night and day, left and right, pleasure and pain. This is exactly what the market does. Energy from the moon (down), energy from the sun (up).

Crypto as a whole is becoming better. Crypto as a whole is evolving. What about Crypto?
Cryptocurrency is doing great and will continue to do great. The Cryptocurrency market is evolving and will continue to evolve.

Think of the 2022 bear-market. When Bitcoin crashes, everything crashes. Bitcoin would only hint at moving lower and everything would be down 20-30%. Now we are seeing the lowest prices in months and many pairs are staying strong, ready to move ahead.

Imagine billions upon billions moving from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin, Tron and the rest, to the smaller Altcoins, what do you think will happen? A major bullish wave.

So, when one side of the market is depressed, the other side can grow. We are here, we are adults, we are advanced, we are smart; we can see this dynamic and instead of letting our Bitcoins lose value, we can take action and profit all day long.

‚ûñ What action to take now?
‚ûñ How to survive the correction?

Sell the pairs that are trading high. High can be those trading near March 2024 prices or February 2024 or near their recent peak. Those are no good, for now. Sell those.

Buy those trading low. Low can be those trading near a strong support. Can be a support that is 1 year old, 2-3 years old, etc.

Buy those trading at All-Time Lows or those trading near their October/September 2023 low/support. These are good now and set to grow.

The Tether (USDT) pairs are risky no matter how they look. They will crash when Bitcoin crashes. Period.

The Bitcoin (BTC) pairs are the only way to succeed at this point. Plenty of time we had to take action, plenty of time to prepare. There is still time now because, while Bitcoin has been going down, some of these Altcoins, most of them, are still at their lowest level in 3,4,5 or 6 years; it can't get any better than this. These will grow long-term and it will be a win-win-win.

‚ûñ What happens if you are wrong?

This is not financial advice.

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Namaste.
Page 1, Article 13: Good afternoon my fellow supporter, readers, followers and Cryptocurrency traders, how are you feeling in this wonderful day?

We are going to look at a classic now, everybody on TradingView knows this one; MA200.

‚ûñ When Bitcoin, or any Cryptocurrency for that matter, trades below MA200 on the daily timeframe we consider this bearish long-term.

‚ûñ When the trading is happening above this level, it is considered bullish.

‚ûñ Bitcoin is currently trading below MA200 on the daily timeframe.

‚ûñ MA200 sits right now at exactly $64,000.
‚ûñ Any trading below this level indicates that a long-term bearish bias is in place.

Thank you for reading.

Page 1, Article 14: Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price rose to resistance 2, which coincided with the resistance zone and broke this level. Then it rose a little higher than the resistance zone and some time traded near until it reached the trend line and then BTC started to decline. In a short time price declined to resistance 1, which coincided with one more resistance zone, breaking resistance 2. As well, the price started to trades inside the wedge, where it rebounded from resistance 1 and tried to grow, but failed and soon dropped back. Some time later BTC fell to the resistance zone and at once rebounded to the trend line, which is the resistance line of the wedge also, and then declined to the support line of the wedge, breaking resistance 1. Recently price bounced up to this level and tried to break it, but failed and now trades below. In my mind, BTCUSDT will make a small movement up and then continue to decline to support line of the wedge. Therefore I set my goal at 54800 points.

Page 1, Article 16: Before the bears said that Bitcoin would fall to $40K, there was no basis for prediction other than self-induced fear.

Let me say Bitcoin is "just as easy" to reach $100K.
Even though Bitcoin is now down $54,200 and has traded below $6K for the last seven days, I think it could easily reach six figures as well, citing macroeconomic factors such as the U.S. government paying a lot of interest on its debt every day and the growing number of businesses holding bitcoins. This is supported by the reserve requirement ratio, $3 billion in debt per day, strategic bitcoin reserves, pension allocations and corporate purchases.
Page 1, Article 17: Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. Observing the chart, we can see that the price some time ago entered to the range, where it at once reached the top part, which coincided with the resistance level and then dropped. BTC fell to the bottom part of the range, which coincided with the current resistance level, and at once rebounded and started to move up. In a short time, the price reached the 61800 level, and broke it, thereby exiting from the range also. Next, the price made a small movement up, after which turned around and started to decline inside the downward channel, where BTC broke the 61800 level one more time. Later, the price declined to the support line of the channel, and at once rose to the resistance line and continued to move down. Price fell to the 56600 level and broke it, after which made a retest and continued to decline. For this case, I think that Bitcoin can make a small movement up and then continue to decline inside the downward channel. Therefore I set my TP at 51000 points.

Page 1, Article 18: hello guys.

let's dive into the monthly time frame of btc analysis.


 Breakout Confirmation:  
The candle highlighted in yellow, initially suspected to be a "hunting candle," has not confirmed its status as such. With 6 subsequent candles failing to validate a hunting pattern, it is more likely a breakout candle indicating a continuation of the bullish trend.

 Scenario Probability:
 The more probable scenario suggests a continued upward movement, targeting the next significant resistance level above $72,000.
The scenario where the price touches the lower level (around $42,000) is less likely, given the strong bullish momentum and support levels seen in the recent price action.

Page 1, Article 19: Hello traders, I want share with you my opinion about Bitcoin. By observing the chart, we can see that the price not long ago declined in a downward channel, where it dropped from the resistance line to the seller zone, which coincided with the resistance level. Then the price bounced up and tried to grow, but soon continued to fall. In a short time, BTC declined below the 57900 level, but later turned around and rose to the resistance line of the channel, after which it reversed and fell to the support line of the downward channel. Then the price rose to the 57900 level and even entered the seller zone, after which it dropped to the support level, exiting the downward channel, and soon broke the 54800 level, falling even lower. But after this, Bitcoin turned around and started to grow inside the upward channel, quickly rising to the 54800 level, which coincided with the buyer zone, and broke it again. Next, the price rose to the resistance level of the channel, after which it rolled down. So, in my opinion, BTC can decline a little more and then start to move up to the resistance line of the upward channel, thereby breaking the resistance level. In this case, I set my TP at 59000 points, which coincides with this line. Please share this idea with your friends and click Boost üöÄ
Page 1, Article 20: Hello everyone,

Today, I‚Äôve prepared an educational guide on chart patterns, specifically focusing on the Flag Pattern.

This content is designed to be easy for beginners to follow, so I hope you find it engaging and informative. :)

Below is the outline I‚Äôll be using for this post:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Outline 

1. What is a Flag Pattern?
 
  Definition
  Key Components
  Characteristics
 

2. Bullish Flag Pattern
 
 Basic Characteristics
 Examples
 

3. Bearish Flag Pattern
 
 Basic Characteristics
 Examples
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 1. What is a Flag Pattern? 

 1) Definition 
 
 A Flag Pattern forms during a brief consolidation phase after a strong price movement, often signaling the continuation of a trend. It typically appears when prices make a sharp move, either up or down, followed by a period of sideways or slightly counter-trend movement.
 Flag Patterns can occur in both uptrends and downtrends, named for their resemblance to an actual flag. After a strong price move, the market consolidates briefly before continuing in the original trend direction.
 

 2) Key Components 
 
 Flagpole: The initial strong price movement that sets the overall trend direction before the consolidation phase.
 Flag: The consolidation period where prices move sideways or slightly counter to the trend, often forming a rectangle or parallelogram. This phase typically occurs with a decrease in trading volume.
 Breakout: The moment when the price resumes its original trend direction. In an uptrend, this is an upward breakout, and in a downtrend, a downward breakout, confirming the continuation of the trend.
 

 3) Characteristics 
 
 Duration: The Flag Pattern typically lasts longer than the Flagpole but varies depending on the timeframe.
 Volume: Volume usually decreases during the Flag‚Äôs formation and increases once the breakout occurs.
 Reliability: The Flag Pattern is considered a reliable indicator of trend continuation, making it a favorite among traders using trend-based strategies.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 2. Bullish Flag Pattern 

 1) Basic Characteristics 
 
 A Bullish Flag forms after a strong upward price movement, signaling a temporary consolidation phase. During this consolidation, volume typically decreases, suggesting that the market is pausing rather than reversing. After this phase, the price often continues its upward trend, accompanied by an increase in volume. Bullish Flag Patterns also help relieve overbought conditions in technical indicators, providing the market with a chance to prepare for another move up.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 This chart from May 2023 shows a strong Flagpole followed by a long consolidation phase (Flag). The volume then increased as the price broke out, completing the Bullish Flag Pattern.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this chart from March 2021, we see a similar setup: a strong Flagpole, followed by a consolidation phase, leading to a breakout that continued the upward trend.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Bearish Flag Pattern 

 1) Basic Characteristics 
 
 The Bearish Flag Pattern is the inverse of the Bullish Flag. It follows a strong downward move (Flagpole) and is followed by a period of consolidation (Flag) with decreasing volume. Like its bullish counterpart, the Bearish Flag can relieve oversold conditions, leading to a continuation of the downtrend after a breakout.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 This chart from May 2022 displays a Bearish Flag Pattern: a strong downward Flagpole, followed by a Flag consolidation phase. After the consolidation, a breakout occurred, continuing the downtrend.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 This chart from February 2022 also illustrates a strong downward Flagpole, followed by a consolidation phase (Flag), leading to a breakout that completed the Bearish Flag Pattern.
 This guide will help you better understand the Flag Pattern and how it can be used in your trading strategy effectively!
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Conclusion 
 I hope the various Flag Patterns and market analysis techniques covered in this post prove helpful in your investment journey. Chart analysis is not merely a technical skill but also a deeper understanding of market psychology and movement. Flag Patterns, along with other chart patterns, visually reflect the psychological dynamics of the market. Mastering their use can greatly contribute to successful trading.

That being said, the crypto market is inherently unpredictable and fast-moving. While technical analysis is a valuable tool, it‚Äôs important to adopt a comprehensive approach that considers broader market trends and external factors. I encourage you to apply the insights gained from this post with a balanced and cautious perspective when making investment decisions.

New opportunities are constantly emerging, and those who are prepared to seize them will find success. The chart represents the market‚Äôs voice. Listening to it, interpreting it, and making informed decisions based on that interpretation is "the essence" of chart analysis.

I sincerely hope that, through continuous learning and experience, you‚Äôll evolve into a more confident and successful investor.

 üìâ Clear Corrective Structure Formed At The BTC Chart, We Have a Rising Wedge By The Clear ABC Structure And At 1H Timeframe Strong Bearish Hammer Formed At The Chart, Also At Higher Time Frame There Is Head And Shoulder  

üéØ Totally I Think Still Bearish Scenario Is More Probable And Leg Down To The 49k And 44k Is a Next Move I Expect For The BITCOIN
Page 1, Article 22: The price perfectly fulfills my previous idea. It hit target level.  BINANCE:BTCUSDT  in continues to trend downward, showing a lack of buying pressure since the last week of August. The price action has consistently produced lower lows and lower closes. Even on the daily timeframe, we‚Äôre seeing these lower lows, despite a recent false breakout below the July low, with the price hovering around that area once again. Historically, September has been a challenging month for Bitcoin, often showing negative performance. This suggests there is a likelihood of the price moving further down, possibly breaching the 50,000 level and targeting the support zone between 48,000 and 45,000. Should the price reach this area, we could potentially see a strong bounce and the beginning of a new bullish trend. My target is support level at 51220.00

2Ô∏è‚É£ We Have a CPI News Today And I Expect a Bullish Effect To The Market 

üìà By These Two Reasons I Think Today BITCOIN Could Breakout The 57300$ Resistance And Trend Line Toward a 60k , 65k And 68k
Page 2, Article 1: Bitcoin Growth Perspective up to 65K
 
Currently, BTC is consolidating, and preparing for its next significant move. 
The key resistance level at $59,600 is important for Bitcoin to overcome to gain further upside momentum

 Technical Analysis 
59.600 price level has been identified as a significant resistance point. 
Breaking through this zone could signal a strong bullish trend which can push Bitcoin up to 62500 which corresponds to another stronger zone.

Continued interest from institutional investors can provide the necessary capital inflow to push BTC past these resistance levels.

Positive regulatory developments can boost market confidence, aiding in the upward movement of Bitcoin.

Global economic conditions, including inflation rates and monetary policies, will also play a significant role in Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory.

 You may find more details in the chart!
Thank you and Good Luck!

Page 2, Article 2: Bitcoin and Ethereum mining wallets noted that the supply of bitcoin has declined since the first half of 2024. A rebound in the total supply of wallets is a sign that these assets could rebound.
On Friday, Bitcoin and ETH were hovering around key support levels.
Analysts believe the recovery in their holdings could signal a bull market for both assets.

This indicates that the bull market of Bitcoin is coming!
Therefore, my view on Bitcoin is still an upward trend, short-term operation friends do not need to worry, I will also provide some operations to let you gain!
Page 2, Article 3: As you can see, BTC has created an ascending head and shoulders and , which has just been broken in the 4-hour time frame and this means that the price can be bullish and I expect the price to go up to the  Fibonacci line of 0.618 = 60k .  Stay tuned for more updates, thanks 

BTC From a different point of view !!!



Previous Analysis
Page 2, Article 4: Currently trading below 200 day EMA on daily chart . Price has not traded in this area since October 23. 

Bull flag break out failed and trapped bulls at 64K (new lower high). 

Potential support for this drop : 38K.
Page 2, Article 5: Hello my dear friends, another weekly session is over and new data becomes available. 
Let's review those in an unbiased way and see what the chart is saying.

‚ûñ The 2-Sept. week just closed at 54,869. This is after being rejected by EMA34.
‚ûñ It is the first time that Bitcoin closes below EMA34 in more than a year.
‚ûñ It is the worst weekly close since Bitcoin moved above 60,000 in February.
‚ûñ It is the worst weekly close, coming out of a major high, since November 2021.

‚ûñ The weekly session also closed below the 0.382 Fib. retracement level relative to the bullish wave that started in September 2023; a major support lost.

‚û¢ Everything is ultra-bearish. 

‚ûñ The weekly session that just closed also ended as a Doji but red. Signaling the continuation of the previous candle. The previous candle was a full red candle.

‚û¢ Everything is so bearish that we need not go any further.

I would love to entertain you more but it would be a waste of time.

All the signals coming from this chart are saying that  Bitcoin is about to crash .

Namaste.
Page 2, Article 6: It is observed that price is traded within a band (blue channel) forming a pattern known as the bullish flag which is highlighted (green) pole and a trading channel (blue). 
This present a massive opportunity as this chart structure indicates a prospective price rise of about 70%. 
This also aligns with the other fundamentals like the US elections in November as usually market makers will take position before significant events.

The idea is to buy at the lower troughs of the blue channel while expecting a price break-out to about $88,000

ACTION PLAN
50,560-53,770	-- BUY
50,550 -48,659	--WAIT/ DO NOTHING 
BELOW 48,396	--SELL

However, this trade idea gives a risk reward  ratio of 8.9.

Goodluck!!

Page 2, Article 10: On a smaller timeframe, we see yet another good start for a potential rejection to happen near 100EMA. 

So far, sellers seem to take dominance near this zone, which is good for us. 

We are looking here for further pressure from sellers and eventually a further downward movement from here!

Swallow Team
Page 2, Article 11: Now bitcoin price is in the ascending Triangle with means the bitcoin price can react to this situation and breaks the triangle and will go up. and the most important resistance for Btc is currently 61k if the price breaks this resistance, AB=CD.
Page 2, Article 12: I want to answer this question right away, for me it's only a matter of time. Of course it will be and even higher

In my opinion, we are seeing consolidation after a strong uptrend, which is normal for financial instruments. And this is even more normal than the volatility we have seen in previous years


At the moment, to continue growth, it is important for us to keep the price above 50,000. If this does not happen then we will go to the next level of support and this is 40,000 and this may mean that we will change the consolidation and go into the downtrend. And I don't think it's the job of big money to let the price go so low 

As we can see from the current test of the support level, the volumes are already much smaller, that is, there are fewer people willing to sell.


Locally our task with the current one is to return and make another attempt at the 60,000 test 


On one of the senior timeframes we can observe a convergence that has not yet formed but has been playing for a very long time 

For now I assume that the support level will hold and we will be able to make another approach to exit the consolidation breakout point is 65.000 and this breakout can send the price to new highs


I wish you all good trading, stay safe and try to use spot))

Page 2, Article 15: Bitcoin  started to rise again after  Failing(Fake Break)  to break the  Support zone($58,000-$56,600) .

From the point of view of  Classical Technical Analysis , it seems that Bitcoin has formed a  Falling Wedge Reversal Pattern , and if the  upper line  of this pattern breaks, we can expect a  further increase in Bitcoin .

From the point of view of  Elliott wave theory , Bitcoin's  correction waves  seem to be continuing. The last corrective wave was the  Zigzag Correction(ABC/5-3-5) , which was the  end of wave C ,  $55,600 .

Also, we can see  Regular Divergence(RD+)  between Consecutive Valleys.

A  head and shoulders pattern could form , causing Bitcoin to  decline again  to nearly  $50,000==Two scenarios are possible üëá


I expect  Bitcoin  to move according to the movements  I have outlined in the chart .

 Note: If Bitcoin loses the Support zone($58,000-$56,600), we should expect Bitcoin to fall to $51,000(at least).

Page 2, Article 20: In this analysis I want to take a look at BTC's short-term price action: what can we expect over the next few days?

As seen on the chart, the price is currently slightly reversing from the diagonal purple resistance. It's too early to call for a reversal, but we have to be cautious nevertheless.

On the bottom you can see the RSI indicator flashing overbought. The previous 2 times this occurred it caused a reversal.

This is exactly the same as today: RSI overbought and hitting resistance. This is not a time to be bullish. I'd wait for the price to pierce through the resistance. For aggressive bears, however, this seems like a perfect bearish swing-trade.

Page 2, Article 22: Hi folks today I'm prepared for you Bitcoin analytics. If we look at the chart we can see how the price some time ago rebounded from the resistance level and dropped lower than the support level, which coincided with the support zone. After this, BTC turned around and in a short time rose higher than the 53900 level, breaking it, and then continued to grow to the resistance level. When the price reached this level, it some time traded near it, after which made the correction and later backed up to the 61200 level. Soon, BTC broke this level and then reached a trend line, after which the price turned around and dropped lower 61200 level, breaking it one more time and continuing to decline. Price declined near the trend line to the support zone, after which the price turned around and made an impulse up, breaking the trend line. At the moment, BTC continues to move up, so, I expect that price will continue to move up to 61200 resistance level. For this case, my goal is this level.

üìà As per our latest analysis, attached on the chart, BTC has rejected the $50,000 - $52,000 support zone and has been trading higher since then.

As long as the bulls remain in control,  a continuation towards the $61,000 - $62,000 resistance zone is expected.

 Bearish H&S: Indicates a potential reversal of an uptrend.
 Bullish H&S: Suggests a potential reversal of a downtrend.
 
 Cup Formations: 
 
 Bearish Cup: Typically forms during a downtrend and might indicate a continuation or reversal.
 Bullish Cup: Generally forms during an uptrend, suggesting continuation or reversal.
 
 Harmonic Patterns:

 Range-Bound Market:  Price is moving within a range, with resistance at $66,813.59 and support around $56,200-$54,650.

 Upside and Downside Hunting:  Failed breakout attempts suggest a potential liquidity grab; price may dip below the current range (downside hunting) before reversing.

 Key Levels:
Resistance: $66,813.59
Support: $56,200 - $54,650 

Outlook:  Short-term bearish with a potential reversal from lower support zones.  Watch for a breakout above the range.

Page 3, Article 11: By analyzing the #Bitcoin chart on the weekly timeframe, we can see that over the past two weeks, the price dropped from $65,000 to $52,500 and is currently trading around $54,400. If the price remains below $57,870, we will likely see further declines in Bitcoin. The potential targets for this drop are $50,750, $49,000, and $44,100. After a short corrective wave, we may witness a significant upward move in Bitcoin, with targets above $80,000.

In these two years, I tried to make a profit by including my analysis point of view. I personally do not expect Bitcoin to fall and expect I have a one-year bullish move from Bitcoin. The hold is much harder than I thought. In these two years, my hold has affected my psyche. Try not to follow the analysis of others who talk about the fall, because there is no information about They do not have the nature of Bitcoin. I hope that Bitcoin will move according to my analysis like the last two years. This year I will celebrate the 150,000 dollar Bitcoin celebration. Remember that God is with those who are patient.

  ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì


As always, I‚Äôve kept the explanations simple and beginner-friendly. I hope this guide provides you with valuable insights!

Here‚Äôs today‚Äôs outline:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Outline

  Definition
  Key components
  Characteristics
 

 2. Head and Shoulders 
 
  Basic features
  Examples
 

 3. Inverse Head and Shoulders 
 
  Basic features
  Examples
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


 1. What is the "Head and Shoulders" pattern? 

 1) Definition 
 The Head and Shoulders pattern is a well-established reversal formation that appears after an uptrend and signals the potential start of a downtrend. It indicates that buying pressure is weakening and selling pressure is gaining momentum. 

 2) Key components 
 
 Left Shoulder:  The initial peak, where the price rises and then pulls back.
 Head : The highest peak, situated between the two shoulders, representing the final bullish push.
 Right Shoulder:  The third peak, which is typically lower than the head but similar to the left shoulder, signaling diminishing buying interest.
 Neckline:  A key support line drawn across the lows of the left and right shoulders. A decisive break below this neckline confirms the reversal and the beginning of a downtrend.
 
 3) Characteristics 
 
 Reversal signal:  The Head and Shoulders pattern marks a transition from an uptrend to a downtrend.
 Easy identification:  The structure is visually distinctive, with three clear peaks.
 Neckline significance:  A break below the neckline serves as a confirmation signal for the downtrend.
 Volume dynamics:  Volume typically rises during the formation of the left shoulder and head, decreases during the right shoulder, and surges again when the neckline is breached.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


 2. Head and Shoulders (Reversal from uptrend to downtrend) 

 1) Basic features 
 End of an uptrend:  The Head and Shoulders pattern forms at the end of a bullish phase, signaling a weakening in buying strength.
 Distinct peak heights:  The head is always higher than the shoulders, which are generally symmetrical, though the right shoulder may sometimes be slightly lower, enhancing the pattern‚Äôs reliability.
 Neckline as a trigger:  The neckline acts as a critical support level. A break below it confirms the pattern and signals the onset of a bearish trend.
 Volume confirmation:  Volume increases during the left shoulder and head formations, weakens during the right shoulder, and spikes when the neckline is broken, confirming a potential sell-off.
 Price target:  After the pattern completes, the expected price drop is typically equal to the distance between the head and the neckline, providing traders with a target.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 In this example, we see a fakeout at the right shoulder, followed by a sharp decline. 
 After a brief retest of the neckline, the price broke through and continued its downtrend.
 


 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this chart, a fakeout occurred when the price dropped from the head and formed the neckline, misleading many market participants. After forming the right shoulder, the price successfully declined. There were two retests, which confirmed the reliability of the pattern.
 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 3. Reverse Head and Shoulders (Trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend) 

 1) Basic features 
 End of a downtrend:  The Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern typically forms at the end of a downtrend, signaling a potential reversal to the upside.
 Formation of lows:  Like the standard Head and Shoulders, this pattern consists of three lows‚Äîleft shoulder, head, and right shoulder‚Äîwith the head being the lowest point.
 Neckline significance:  The neckline is drawn across the highs of the left and right shoulders. A break above this line confirms the reversal and acts as a strong buy signal.
 Volume pattern:  Volume tends to decrease during the formation of the pattern but surges when the neckline is broken, signaling strong buying momentum.
 Target setting:  After the pattern is confirmed, the expected price rise is often equal to the distance from the head to the neckline, which helps traders set profit targets.
 

 2-1) Example 1 

 
 After the Head and Shoulders pattern formed, the price broke above the neckline, successfully reversing the downtrend into an uptrend. A buy strategy would have yielded profits at the breakout point.
 

 2-2) Example 2 

 
 In this example, a smaller Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern formed within the head of a larger pattern (see Example 3). After two successful retests, the price reversed into a strong uptrend.
 

 2-3) Example 3 

 
 This example showcases the smaller Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern mentioned in Example 2, located within the head. After two successful retests, a buy strategy could have led to profits as the price reversed into an uptrend.
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 ‚úîÔ∏è Conclusion 

 "Charts are the maps of the market." 

 The Head and Shoulders and Reverse Head and Shoulders patterns we‚Äôve covered in this post are key signals that frequently appear in the market. Charts aren‚Äôt random‚Äîthey are visual representations of market psychology and investor behavior. As traders, our role is to interpret these maps, navigate the market, and make informed decisions.

Investing is more than just buying and selling. Sometimes the market may move contrary to our expectations, while other times we seize opportunities and achieve success. Each experience is a chance to learn and grow. The more experience you gain, the more paths you‚Äôll recognize on the chart.

Success in this market requires persistence, patience, and continuous learning. Understanding and analyzing chart patterns like the ones discussed here is just the beginning. I hope this post has helped you gain a deeper understanding of the market and make more informed decisions.

The market is always evolving, but within that evolution lies opportunity. The key is developing the ability to spot those opportunities. With knowledge, experience, and confidence, you‚Äôll find greater success.

Stay prepared, and always listen to what the market is telling you.
Page 3, Article 17: #BTC

Bitcoin price is moving in a descending channel on the 4-hour frame and is largely adhering to its borders.

The price has touched the lower limit of the channel, which is considered a support area in green at $53,000.

The price is now 54,600, which is the entry point.
The price is expected to reach the upper limit of the channel at $56,730.

Page 3, Article 19: Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a modest decline on Wednesday, dropping approximately 1.5% to trade at $56,500. The slip comes after the highly anticipated U.S. presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump made no mention of cryptocurrency regulation.

The debate, which covered a wide range of topics from abortion rights to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, left crypto enthusiasts and investors yearning for clarity on the candidates' stances regarding digital assets. And now the ripple effect of Bitcoin's decline has been felt across the broader cryptocurrency market.

Despite the day's losses, data suggests continued institutional appetite for cryptocurrencies, with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recording a substantial net inflow of $117 million.

While cryptocurrency regulation wasn't addressed during the presidential debate, former President Trump's stance on digital assets has evolved significantly.
Initially skeptical, Trump has recently embraced Bitcoin, suggesting it could be "the new gold."                   In a recent interview, he even hinted at potentially appointing Elon Musk to oversee the U.S. financial system if re-elected, signaling a pro-crypto direction for his potential future administration.
On the other hand, Vice President Harris has been more cautious in her approach to cryptocurrency. 
During her time as a Senator, Harris co-sponsored the Blockchain Promotion Act in 2019, which aimed to create a working group to explore the potential uses of blockchain technology.
However, she has not made many public statements specifically about cryptocurrency regulations since becoming vice president.

as I published before.



 Descending Channel:  The price is trading within a downward channel, indicating a short-term bearish trend.

 Upside Rejection:  Attempts to break above the upper boundary near $59,000 failed, suggesting resistance.

 Downside Target:  If the price continues to follow the channel, it may target the lower boundary near $54,000.

 Key Levels: 
 
 Resistance: $59,000
 Support: $54,000
 Outlook: Bearish momentum with potential downside extension towards the lower support zone. Watch for any break below $54,000 or above the channel for trend reversal signals.

Page 3, Article 21: Hello everyone!

Bitcoin is currently displaying the  '3 Market Phases,'  and we‚Äôre transitioning from Contraction into Expansion. As long as the price holds above the lower boundary of the horizontal channel, I believe there‚Äôs a strong likelihood of continued upward momentum.



 Key points: 
 
 Break below the channel:  A breakdown could signal the beginning of a significant downtrend. However, if the channel holds, the uptrend is expected to persist.
 Uptrend continuation:  There‚Äôs a solid chance we could see a rise toward the 63K level.

Page 3, Article 22: Hello everyone,

Here‚Äôs a quick and simple breakdown of the key support and resistance zones.
Below are the reasons why these zones have been selected:

 ‚úîÔ∏è Support Zone 1. ($53,329.5 ~ $52,372.5) 

 
 Descending channel
 Fibonacci 0.786 retracement
 Significant low (S/R Flip)
 


 ‚úîÔ∏è Resistance Zone 1. ($55,969.0 ~ $55,499.6) 

 
 Fibonacci 0.236 retracement
 Significant low (S/R Flip)
 


 ‚úîÔ∏è Resistance Zone 2. ($58,218.0 ~ $57,348.7) 

 
 Fibonacci 0.382 retracement
 Significant low (S/R Flip)
 

There's a strong likelihood of significant price action within these zones, either as support or resistance. Keep a close eye on Bitcoin‚Äôs movement in these areas. Best of luck!

 *S/R Flip: Support/Resistance Flip

For the upward trend to continue, this trendline needs to be broken. Also support area has been shown on the chart.

The market is extremely bearish!
The annual candle has always been red after the halving! I emphasize always.
In the best case, he will see the price of 25,000 dollars and in the worst case, the price of Bitcoin will be 10,000 dollars.
After this, we can think about bitcoin above 100 or 150 thousand dollars!

Although it is a short rise, the StochRSI indicator is already showing signs of entering the overbought zone.

Accordingly, the key is whether it can maintain the price above the MS-Signal indicator (M-Signal on the 1D chart) while receiving support near 56150.01-56950.56 and rising above 57889.10.

If not,
1st: 54730.0
2nd: 52137.67
You should check for support near the 1st and 2nd above.

Currently, since the M-Signal of the 1W chart > M-Signal of the 1D chart > M-Signal of the 1M chart, we need to check if it can lead to a movement to change the M-Signal of the 1D chart > M-Signal of the 1W chart.

Therefore, if it rises above 57889.10,
1st: 59053.55
2nd: 60672.0-61099.25
You can trade depending on whether there is support near the 1st and 2nd above.

The volatility period will begin soon.

As we pass around September 13 (September 12-14), we need to check in which direction it deviates from the 52137.617-61099.25 range and respond accordingly.



We are always at a crossroads.

I think we need to observe the flow of funds in the coin market to make a clearer choice at this crossroads.

It is not easy for individual investors to know the flow of funds.

We can only briefly understand the flow of funds due to stable coins such as USDT and USDC.

Currently, USDT is sideways, and USDC is gapping up, which is the driving force behind the coin market.

However, I think that USDT needs to gap up for the market to start a real uptrend.

Therefore, we need to think about how to increase the number of coins and tokens corresponding to profits while trading from a short-term perspective for the current uptrend.

Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after rising above 29K.

The section expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (when overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (when overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

Since I think it can create a new trend in the overshooting section, I need to check the movement when this section is touched.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to create a pull back pattern and start after rising to around 57014.33.

Page 4, Article 4: #BTC: No Major Changes Yet..!! Bitcoin has been consolidating within a Descending Broadening Wedge for the past six months. Breaking through the critical $69-70k resistance level is essential for the bulls to regain control. Despite multiple failed attempts, there is renewed optimism that this time could be different, as the resistance is showing signs of weakening.

A successful breakout above the Descending Broadening Wedge could propel Bitcoin towards the $100k mark in Q4. However, for now, leverage trading might not be the best approach. If you‚Äôre holding Bitcoin, it‚Äôs time to sit back and relax‚Äîthe next bull run could be just around the corner.

Page 4, Article 5: I'm seeing that the price of bitcoin could explode at any time. However, I'm starting to notice weakness in the bounce so I've taken the opportunity to make a short entry as it hasn't broken strongly above the 4h FVG and only went up for liquidity.

  


Trade management: SL in the wick in case it resumes the upward bias better get out of the way. TP on the swing low.

Page 4, Article 7: Bitcoin is retesting the old range lows as support, for the second day in a row. Bulls want to see this general level hold.

Many expected significant price action during the debate, which did not really happen. Bitcoin is clearly stuck in the mud in this part of the cycle, waiting for the next big move. The longer we trade sideways, the bigger the next move will be.
Page 4, Article 8: 4H candle is closed very bullish!

The next important levels for BTC: 56,900 and 59,900
If we see bearish signs up there, we prepare for Sell/Short positions.
Page 4, Article 9: BTC's price recently bounced from a strong support zone. A potential Bullish reversal seems in play as the price action has broken the previous Lower High. 

This is the 3rd Bounce from key Monthly Fibonacci levels since the previous massive Bull rally (along with further confluence from key Fibonacci Harmonic levels on the shorter 4HR time frame). 

Bounces from these critical levels may eventually lead to the completion of a massive Bullish flag/Cup & Handle Patterns on the Monthly time frames.

If price breaks the all time high and crosses 74000, the chances of TP2 will increase.

Page 4, Article 12: Headline & Core Inflation 
13:30 (GMT) see's the release of the atest round of inflation data. The results here are pretty black and white high inflation (over 2.6% YOY for Inflation, over 3.2% for Core Inflation) is bad. End of. 

We need inflation t come down so we can cut the rates.

Heres where any predictions get a bit tricky though. Very good inflation data 2% like 2% or under could mean we get a big rate cut (50bps is a 33% chance atm). That would send the market wild. Coming in at 2.6% / 2.5% will give us a 25bps rate cut - which is bullish but might be priced in to some degree.

 Either way, low inflation good. High infation bad. 
 
Inflation Rate (YOY) 
Predicted = 2.6% Priced In
 <2.6% = Bullish 
>2.6% = Bearish

 Core Inflation Rate (YOY) - Inflation data not including food and fuel. 
Predicted = 3.2% Priced In
<3.2% = Bullish
>3.2% = Bearish

 Technicals 
In terms of the charts I'd say thats an ascending triangle.

Nice little series of higher lows being capped by flat resistance at $57.5k.

Usually a bullish set up, but realistically thats not going to mean alot if inflation is 9%.

 Trading Plan 
What we can say though is that the overhead resistance starting at $57.5 is basically toast if we get a good inflation read so If we get a good read go long.

Targets are not clear but after the immediate cluster theres an old support/resistance at $63.7k so maybe target $60k ($59.9k to be safe) and $63.7k incase we blow through it.

Bad inflation = short. It could be bad but still take incramental profit to be safe at support, so $53.5k, $50k and maybe hold a bit back as we could easily sink much lower.

 Prediction  - 2.6% price pumps to $60k area (I hope!)
Page 4, Article 13: In less than six months, you will see Bitcoin at $38,000 and $35,000, and you will see $70,000 in two years.

Page 4, Article 14: Bitcoin is suffering in the daily time frame and it can fall down sharply and reach the limit of 40-48. In the meantime, the dominance of Bitcoin is also falling, which is a sign of stagnation in the altcoin market. Please note that In this case, don't go to them when the coins are pumped because it will be an excuse for your liquidation. The best time to buy bitcoin and altcoins is between 40-48

Page 4, Article 16: 200EMA is still holding the ground where EMA is not letting the price through. 

Our gameplan here is simple: if we manage to hold this zone until the end of the zone, if we see a rejection happen in 36 hours, then we will see a good downward movement from here. 

But remember, fakeout option is still possible but only if buyers manage to breakout and secure the zone above EMAs.

Page 4, Article 17: Hello everyone, a few days ago, the price of Bitcoin fell to the resistance level and immediately bounced back. After that, there was another reversal and a strong downward impulse, breaking 63900 at the level of 53200. Then the price went up and down. For a short period of time, BTC fell to the support level, which coincided with the support area, and it finally rebounded and began to move higher not long ago. Therefore, I expect Bitcoin to continue its correction trend and continue to grow to 70K.
I set two goals for this situation,
The first is at 57,400 and the second is at 60,600.
Page 4, Article 18: After Bitcoin retraced nearly 19% from its recent highs, I believe it hasn‚Äôt yet reached the average cycle correction of around 22%, which could take the price down to about $57,500. In a more bearish scenario, the correction could deepen to 25%, or even extend toward $50,000‚Äã.

Factoring in U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, will drive short-term volatility, it is likely that it will lead to market downturns before any stable recovery‚Äã. Even if BTC does put higher and reach near $65,000,the short term upside would be capped as major selling pressure is likely to appear there. This makes the $60,500 level a reasonable point to short with a target of 
 around $59,000 at the 200EMA.

Page 4, Article 20: Bitcoin took a significant hit yesterday, dropping past our initial target zone and finding support at the secondary zone outlined in Plan B.

The purpose of our plan is to identify key levels or zones that serve as strong areas for potential trades. If the Plan B level continues to hold, the price may form a potential leading diagonal, creating a wave structure from 1-5 as highlighted on the chart.

This scenario could push BTC's next target back to the 66k-68k range. This setup allows us to use a tight stop loss just below 56k.
 
It's a volatile market, so we should be prepared for any outcome. Trade safely.

Page 4, Article 22: Bitcoin can reach up to 56,000 and maybe with a little optimism up to 57,800 in the second stage, for a stronger climb, you have to be a little patient so that the conditions are met.
Page 4, Article 23: Based on the analysis of price action and the identified supply and demand zones, BTC/USDT appears to be at a critical juncture with the 50% retracement level acting as a significant resistance. If the price fails to break through this level and encounters selling pressure, a fall towards lower levels is plausible. It is crucial for traders to keep an eye on the behavior around the lower demand zones to gauge the strength of the potential reversal or continuation of the downward trend.

as we continue to consolidate and fear begins to rise, it becomes blatantly clear to me as to what is truly going on.

we're clearly in a fourth wave.
fourth waves are notorious for creating fear, uncertainty, and doubt. they make you question weather the trend is truly over, they bore you with sideways price action which makes you hand over your hard earned coin to the one who is re-accumulating, in preparation for the next mark-up phase.

the person who is accumulating will buy everything you have to sell, 1:1. not a penny more.
whenever you run out of coin to sell, the accumulator will begin the mark-up phase, and you will likely begin to fomo back into the market after awhile, which will cause an aggressive \ parabolic push up.

this is a time for accumulation,
not for capitulation.

A few moments ago price entered to rising channel, where it reached $61800 level, broke it, and continued to move up.

Price reached resistance line, then it turned around and started to decline and soon exited from channel.

Next, price continued to decline in wedge, where it declined lower than $61800 and $55700 levels, breaking its.

Then BTC reached support line of wedge and then started to grow inside another rising channel.

In this channel, price broke $55700 level and at the moment it trades near resistance line of channel.

Possible, BTC can reach resistance line of channel and then start to decline to $55500

Swallow Team
Page 5, Article 12: hello guys.

 Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern:  The chart highlights a clear Inverse Head and Shoulders formation, a well-known bullish reversal pattern. The left shoulder, head, and right shoulder are well-defined, signaling a potential trend reversal from the previous downtrend.

 Breakout Above the Neckline:  The price has broken above the neckline, which confirms the reversal pattern. This is typically a strong bullish signal indicating further upward momentum.

 Engulfing Pattern:  An Engulfing pattern at the right shoulder supports the bullish case, suggesting the buyers are gaining control, pushing the price higher.

 Next Target: The projected target for this breakout is $62,000, which is indicated on the chart. This would be the next key resistance level where traders might take profits or reassess positions. 
 
Pullback Potential:  There is also a possibility of a minor pullback to retest the breakout area (around $58,500), which would act as support before continuing upward.

Page 5, Article 13: Not much has changed here for Bitcoin, even though we did get a decent move up yesterday back into the range.

What ‚Äúmay‚Äù be important is that Bitcoin has potentially put in it‚Äôs first higher low since the all time high. As you can see, we have had bearish market structure - a series of lower highs and lower lows. This higher low would be conrirmed by a break above $65,000 - the last lower high.
Page 5, Article 14: it is the result of price pattern reading, various indicators and many other pyramids.

It is possible that the rise in the white box will be deleted maximally.
The last drop is not a mini abc, which gives the probability that it will drop below 49k.
More information in the updates that may say this is a potential truth.

Page 5, Article 15: Yes, the title is correct.

I anticipate a massive sell off this weekend and by the time you read this post I will already be in the trade. In fact am already in a short from previous Idea this will be a big scale in position.

Briefly put, the bears are in control whether you like it or not. I don't care which side is in control like many of you in the chat, I just want to be on the right side. Long term we bullish but right now we correcting and as such bearish on lower timeframes

Weekly, daily, 4hr and 1hr timeframe are all trending down. Which means the odds are significantly in favor of the bears-We don't get easy markets like this all the time. Its that simple guys. Trade probabilities, why would you want to go against the trend, or rationalized it...that's futile. If the market was to flip bullish, you don't have to ask me twice if am a look for a long, if plan says long then go long.

Now, the bull market is safe as long as we don't break below 26k area. Let me just state that quickly because I see many in Tv chat calling bear market and that's because you guys don't understand market structure and trends properly. Believe it or not all this down movement is just one big correction...until it's not, that's why 26k is important to hold but I don't think we'll fall that low. 47-45k is my prediction for bottom, if that fail then 31k.

Anyways, just wanted to give a bit of context. For this trade:

potential early close at $53500...I doubt here will be enough demand there but its a potential reversal area to monitor.

Main tp is $51500, I will for sure take at least 75% off since it's so close to final tp which is $50,000 where I will fully close the position.

That's the plan given all goes well. The odds are in my favor and checks all the boxes in my trade plan.

I Just now entered short and posting this idea right now. I'll update in the comment if I decide to make any adjustments.

Overall RR to 51500 is roughly 10 RR which would be a fxcking blessing for my accounts.

This post is longer than usual but such a bold prediction deserves it.
Page 5, Article 16: BTC Update:

Bitcoin is moving as expected. Yesterday, it made a sudden drop but quickly recovered. The current price of $58.1k needs to move strongly to continue the rally.

The RSI continues to gain bullish momentum and still has room to grow.

The target of  FWB:67K -$68k remains unchanged.

I'll provide updates on the altcoins shortly, so stay tuned. If you have any requests for specific altcoins, let me know in the comments or via DM.

Page 5, Article 18: BTC is set for another down trend . watch closely for better sell opportunity if all confirmations hold
Page 5, Article 19: Analyzing the Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) 4-hour chart gives a clear view of the market's recent activities and provides insight into potential future movements:

Overview of Current Market Conditions:

Bitcoin is currently trading around $56,590, following a significant downtrend from its recent highs. This movement has positioned Bitcoin just above a major support level at $54,319.86 (S1), which is critical to watch in the short term.
Support and Resistance Levels:

Immediate resistance is identified at $58,672.95 (R1). This level could act as a short-term barrier for any upward movements. Further resistance is seen at $65,731.15 (R2) and $70,387.98 (R3), which align with previous price consolidation zones and peaks.
Key support levels are $54,319.86 (S1) and a more substantial base at $48,745.21 (S2). These levels could potentially hold further price declines if the current support fails.
Technical Indicators:

The MACD is currently below the signal line and hovering near zero, indicating a weak momentum and a bearish market stance. This suggests that there might be continued downward pressure or consolidation in the near term.
The RSI is at 43.44, which is neither in the oversold nor overbought territory. However, it leans towards a bearish sentiment, aligning with the MACD's indications.
Trading Strategy:

Given Bitcoin's proximity to the $54,319.86 support level (S1), my immediate strategy would be to monitor this level closely. A bounce off this support with increased volume could signal a potential buying opportunity, targeting the first resistance at $58,672.95 (R1). Conversely, a break below this support could see Bitcoin testing the next major support at $48,745.21 (S2), presenting a short position opportunity.
Entering a trade, I would place a stop-loss just below $54,000 for long positions, to mitigate risk in case of a sudden downturn. For short positions, a stop just above $54,500 after confirming a breakdown would be prudent.
Risk Management:

Considering the volatile nature of Bitcoin, maintaining a strict risk management strategy is crucial. Adjusting stop-loss levels to break-even when prices move favorably can protect gains and reduce potential losses.
Regularly reviewing upcoming economic events and news that may affect market sentiment is also vital, as crypto markets can be highly responsive to such stimuli.
Overall, this analysis aims to leverage technical insights to capitalize on Bitcoin's price movements, balancing between cautious observation and readiness to act on clear market signals.

USDT, USDC seem to have gapped up as the weekend approaches.

I think the gapped up is a sign of funds flowing into the coin market.



The rise in USDT dominance is likely to lead to a decline in the coin market.

However, since funds flow into the coin market through USDT, I think that USDT dominance will show an upward trend in the medium to long term when considering it from a medium to long term perspective.

When funds flowing into the coin market purchase coins and tokens, USDT or USDC flow back into the exchange, which is expressed as a decline in USDT dominance.

Therefore, I think that in order for a large bull market in the coin market to begin, USDT dominance will start to decline after a large rise.


In that sense, the 4.97 point of USDT dominance is expected to be an important turning point.

If USDT dominance rises above 6.39, the coin market is likely to show a large decline.

I think that if it rises above 6.39 and then falls to the 4.97-6.39 range, the coin market is likely to form a bottom range.

My personal hope is that it will fall after receiving resistance near 6.39 ~ Fibonacci ratio 0.75.

If that happens, I think the coin market will already be on an uptrend before it is recognized as a bottom.

We need to see whether individual investors will recognize it as a bottom and give them a buying opportunity, or whether they will not give them a buying opportunity.


In that sense, I expect the volatility period around September 13 to be a meaningful period.


In fact, this volatility period is the period set on the 1W chart.

Therefore, the actual volatility period is the week before and after September 16.

In other words, if expressed as a 1-day period, it corresponds to September 9-29.

The strong support zone is expected to be around 42K-43K.

I think this is the zone that most people are expecting.

Therefore, if we give individual investors a buying opportunity as I mentioned earlier, I think it will touch around 42K-43K.

If we do not give individual investors a buying opportunity, it is expected to turn upward near the M-Signal indicator on the 1M chart.

In other words, it is expected to touch around the Fibonacci ratio of 0.707 (48064.07) ~ 0.786 (51606.42) and turn upward.

-

When looking at the NAS100USD chart, we need to check if the StochRSI indicator enters the oversold zone again when a new candle is created.

The important zone is the 17854.8 point.

If it falls below this point, it is likely to touch the Fibonacci ratio 0.618 (17141.4) on the right.

Therefore, I expect the trend to form after the volatility period of BTC that I mentioned earlier.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that the real uptrend will start after it rises above 29K.

The expected range to touch in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41
101875.70-106275.10 (overshooting)
4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

#BTCUSD 1M

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.

-----------------
Page 5, Article 22: Hello, this is full-time trader full_time_trader88.

Here‚Äôs the Bitcoin market analysis for September 10.

Let‚Äôs dive right in.




 (Ascending Channel Perspective)

üî¥ Ascending Channel 1 

This is the first short-term ascending channel (pink).
 Bitcoin has broken out to the upside and even completed a support retest.

The price was already trending upwards within the channel, but this breakout further solidifies the bullish outlook.

 üîµ Ascending Channel 2 

This is another smaller ascending channel, which has also broken to the upside‚Äîanother positive indicator.

As long as these ascending channels hold, the overall trend remains bullish.





 (Descending Channel Perspective)

üü† Descending Channel 

This descending channel had been in place for about a week. After breaking down through the lower boundary, Bitcoin has rebounded and is now testing the upper resistance.

Currently, it‚Äôs facing resistance for the third time.
A breakout from this channel would be a significant move.




 (Both Channels Together) 

Here‚Äôs what the combined view of both the ascending and descending channels looks like.





 (Bollinger Bands Perspective)

üî¥ Lower Bollinger Band Break 

Recently, the candles broke below the lower Bollinger Band.

Historically, when this occurs, the price tends to rebound towards the middle band, and it has done so recently.

Given this pattern, we can expect a potential rise to the middle Bollinger Band,
currently sitting at $58.9K.





 (Angle Perspective)

üîµ Gradual Decline Followed by a Steep Drop 

If you observe recent downtrends, they tend to begin with a gradual decline before accelerating sharply, which often marks the bottom.

The early September drop follows a similar pattern, suggesting we may be in a potential bottoming area.

In such cases, Bitcoin has historically rebounded beyond the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. For the recent drop, this would take us above $60K, indicating a possible short-term rally to that level‚Äîan encouraging signal.

(Of course, no chart pattern guarantees certainty.)





 (Symmetrical Triangle Perspective)

üü£ Mid-sized Symmetrical Triangle 

This is a mid-sized symmetrical triangle spanning 43 days.

As it hasn‚Äôt broken out yet, it could potentially extend to a 50‚Äì60 day consolidation period.

This is one of the largest symmetrical triangles we‚Äôve seen this year.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Volume 

The volume within the triangle is inconsistent, making the pattern less reliable.
However, due to its size, I‚Äôm watching it closely.





 (Large Descending Channel Perspective)

üü¢ Large Descending Channel 

This large descending channel has been in place for about six months, dating back to March 2024.

Bitcoin has stayed within this channel throughout, with every candle contained inside. It‚Äôs quite a persistent structure.

The recent bottom coincided with a bounce off the lower boundary of this channel, making it a key support level.

(Previous attempts to break below were unsuccessful, as the daily close remained inside the channel. The daily close is, therefore, an important indicator.)






 (Major Support Zone Perspective)

üü£ Consolidation Before a Major Rally 

Historically, Bitcoin consolidated for around 10 days before a 50% rally.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Major Support Zone (50.5‚Äì53.0K) 

I‚Äôve highlighted a rectangular box at this consolidation area, which now serves as a major support zone.

This area has provided key support during Bitcoin‚Äôs lows in July, August, and September.

I view the 50.5K‚Äì53.0K range as a critical support zone.





 (Combined View of Symmetrical Triangle + Large Descending Channel + Major Support Zone) 

Here‚Äôs what the chart looks like when we combine these elements.






 (CPI Schedule)

‚ö™Ô∏è CPI (Consumer Price Index) 

The CPI data will be released on September 11 at 8:30 AM.

It‚Äôs essential to observe whether this data impacts the crypto market. 

Historically, CPI releases have had a significant influence on crypto prices, so be cautious as we may see increased volatility during this period.

-


 

1. The uptrend is still intact.

2. The outcome of the mid-sized symmetrical triangle and large descending channel will be pivotal.

3. Be prepared for potential volatility during tomorrow‚Äôs CPI release.


This is a simple summary of my thoughts. 

Please use it as a reference, and I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your follow and like.

Thank you!

 Volume Momentum Using MACD: This indicator calculates the MACD based on smoothed volume changes. By using the difference between two moving averages of volume (short-term subtracted from long-term), it highlights significant shifts in volume momentum, which are essential for confirming trend strength and sustainability.
 Fractal Analysis: Fractals are used to identify natural repetition patterns in price movements around significant highs and lows. This indicator employs multiple fractal lengths to capture a comprehensive picture of market structure and pivot points, enhancing the detection of potential trend reversals or continuations.
 Trend Confirmation: By combining the insights from volume momentum and fractal analysis, this tool filters out false signals and provides a more reliable confirmation of the underlying market trend.
 
 
 How It Works 
 
 The MACD of volume highlights shifts in market momentum, with a focus on how recent volume compares to historical norms.
 Fractals delineate critical points in the price structure, offering visual cues about potential turning points based on historical price action.
 The indicator synthesizes these elements to paint a clear picture of potential trend developments, signaling green when both volume momentum and fractal proximity suggest a bullish trend, and red when they indicate bearish conditions.
Page 6, Article 1: Bitcoin is consolidating and preparing for its next big move.

Technical analysis
Important resistance at the price level of 59.600 has been broken. Is crucial for the coin to gain further upside momentum
Breaking out of this area similarly signals a strong bullish trend, which could push Bitcoin to 62500, which corresponds to another stronger area -65000

Continued interest from institutional investors could provide the necessary capital inflows to push Bitcoin above these resistance levels.

Positive regulatory developments can boost market confidence and help Bitcoin rise.

Global economic conditions, including inflation rates and monetary policy, will also play an important role in Bitcoin's price trajectory.


Thanks for watching and good luck with your deal
Page 6, Article 2: Everyone is turning very bullish, which is not good for the crypto market. With the upcoming bloody September, we have a strong confluence to sell Bitcoin with the current price of 63,800. Why are Bitcoin and whole crypto in a bear market? On the chart, we can see that the price is printing lower lows and lower highs, which is by definition a downtrend. It has been like this since March 2024, and nothing has changed since then. We can see that the price is inside this descending parallel channel on the daily chart. There are no signs of strength in higher timeframes! Bulls didn't prove their strength yet, so to me it looks like a bull trap, and we will see a 30% crash!

From the Elliott Wave perspective, we have an ABC correction so far, and it's too early to tell if this will turn into an impulse wave or not, but right now this is a corrective structure. The problem is that everyone is turning bullish again; everyone sees a huge bull market, but usually the market does the opposite.

Let me know what you think about my analysis in the comment section, and please hit boost and follow for more ideas. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach! Thank you, and I wish you successful trades.
Page 6, Article 3: Hi Guys
Like Yesterday i am expecting some sells before the news ( Which target reached ) , You need to make sure Quickly in and out before news come in .
Market looks Bearish but could it sell it before news . Want see what seller gonna do
 
please note that : if bears  not step in just before news i will  close my short position 

Good luck




This is not investment advice
Page 6, Article 4: üÜïIt's certainly concerning to see BlackRock, a financial giant, experience its first outflow from its Bitcoin Trust. This could indeed exert downward pressure on Bitcoin's price, especially in the short term, as it may signal a shift in sentiment among institutional investors.

‚≠êHowever, it's important to consider the broader context. While BlackRock's outflow is notable, other major asset managers are still seeing inflows. Furthermore, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond short-term capital flows.

‚≠êFor instance, developments like the partnership between Merlin Chain and BitcoinOS, aimed at improving network scalability and efficiency, could significantly bolster Bitcoin's long-term prospects. Such advancements have the potential to drive increased demand and adoption.

‚úÖUltimately, while short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, it's crucial to maintain a long-term perspective. Technical analysis, combined with a deep understanding of fundamental factors, can provide valuable insights into Bitcoin's future price movements. The market will ultimately decide, and it's wise to stay informed and adapt to evolving market dynamics

üíéDaily #Bitcoin Analysis
üöÄIn our previous analysis, we predicted a bullish move from the weekly timeframe channel's bottom, which successfully occurred, reaching our initial target of 57877.90‚úÖü§ë

‚ö†Ô∏èAs previously mentioned, this target represents a significant resistance level (daily timeframe pivot: monthly resistance)‚ùóÔ∏è

‚úÖContinuation of the bullish-Trend Scenario:
If the 57877.90 resistance is breached on the daily time-frame, we anticipate further growth towards targets of 63002.85, 66755.85, and ultimately 74537.70üöÄ

‚úÖLower Price Entry Scenario:
Given the strong resistance at the monthly level, a pullback is possible before a breakout.
However, if a correction occurs, we remain bullish and expect #Bitcoin to find support at one of the following levelsüëá
55743.20 (weekly support), 51676.75-52489.40, or 48483.55-50096.10, from which it can resume its upward trajectory towards the aforementioned targets

‚ùåStop-Loss for the Bullish Scenario: Our bullish view would only be invalidated if a weekly candle closes below 49000.00üîªüîª
üîÑIn such a case, we will provide an updated analysisüßê

...............................
üíé#Bitcoin Analysis: ‚è±4-Hour Timeframe

üìåBased on the price touching the daily pivot point (monthly resistance) and the subsequent temporary weakness:

üëâIf the price breaks down on the 4-hour timeframe due to this contact and reaches the support zone of 55059.97 - 55743.20:
üí∞We can use the formation of a head and shoulders pattern to determine the subsequent direction of movement on this timeframe.

‚úÖbullish scenario: If the price reaches the mentioned support zone, bounces, and breaks above the neck-line of the head and shoulders pattern, it confirms a continuation of the uptrend from this area.

‚úÖtemporary bearish scenario: If the 4-hour timeframe breaks below the head and shoulders pattern, it indicates a continuation of the bear-trend towards the second and third support levels of the main analysis. The price is expected to attempt to form a bottom at one of these support levels.


üíé4-Hour Timeframe Analysis(
‚ùóÔ∏èThere is also a possibility of a temporary rally to the resistance zone of 58556.01 - 58936.40, followed by a decline to the support zone of 55059.97 - 55743.20.

‚úÖIn this scenario, the head and shoulders pattern should be drawn with a positive slope, and we would wait for a breakout below the lower boundry or above the upper boundry to signal a temporary decline or a continuation of the growth.

‚ùåThis scenario remains valid until a significant breakout above the monthly #Bitcoin resistance occurs, which would confirm the continuation of the bull-trend from this level on the daily timeframe.
Page 6, Article 5: TL;DR for Busy Readers

 
 95% confidence that Bitcoin has bottomed at $52.5k, with the worst possible scenario at $50.4k.
 The USDT Dominance Chart is showing resistance levels not seen since the last bear market when Bitcoin was around $27k.
 For Bitcoin to hit $44k, USDT dominance would need to enter bear market territory, which is highly unlikely.
 A 30%+ downside move in USDT dominance suggests more capital will flow into Bitcoin, signaling a bullish uptrend.
 The odds are heavily in favor of Bitcoin moving upward from here, and I expect it to play out over the rest of the month.
 

I‚Äôm 95% confident that we‚Äôve bottomed out at $52.5k, and the worst case scenario would be $50.4k. Additionally, I‚Äôm 95% certain we won‚Äôt see a drop to $44k or anywhere near it. Here‚Äôs why.

 The USDT Dominance Chart: A Key Indicator 
One of the most reliable charts for predicting Bitcoin tops and market reversals is the USDT Dominance chart. This chart tracks the dominance of Tether (USDT) in the market, and right now, it‚Äôs showing levels not seen since the last bear market when Bitcoin was trading around $27k.

Currently, USDT Dominance is at critical resistance, touching levels that are typically only observed during bear markets. Historically, when USDT dominance hits these levels, it signals a bottom for Bitcoin and the beginning of an uptrend.

Additionally, the USDT dominance chart indicates we could see over a 30%+ move to the downside in USDT dominance, meaning more capital will flow out of stablecoins and back into Bitcoin and other cryptos. This is a strong indicator that Bitcoin is bottoming out and preparing for a bullish move.

 Why $44k is Unlikely 
For Bitcoin to drop to $44k, USDT dominance would have to enter territory that we‚Äôve only ever seen in true bear markets. If this happens, it could break the higher timeframe (HTF) structure on both the USDT dominance chart and the Bitcoin chart, and ultimately, we wouldn‚Äôt just stop at $44k‚Äîwe‚Äôd probably end up around $30k.

 That‚Äôs why if you‚Äôre hoping for $44k , you‚Äôre really wishing for a major bear market that could pull Bitcoin down much further. This scenario would mean a shift in the current market structure, which doesn‚Äôt align with the probabilities we‚Äôre seeing.

 Upside Probability is Much Higher 
While there‚Äôs always a chance that USDT dominance could break higher and push the market lower, the probability of this happening is very small in my opinion. Investing is all about probabilities, and when we assess the entire market situation, it‚Äôs clear that the upside is heavily favored right now.

Based on the data, the market structure, and the USDT dominance chart, the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing upward from here is very high. It‚Äôs important to monitor how the market behaves in the coming weeks, but all signs point toward a bullish move.

 My years of experience kind of Opinion 
In summary, the USDT dominance chart is signaling that we‚Äôve likely seen the bottom at $52.5k, and the chances of Bitcoin falling to $44k or lower are extremely slim. If anything, this level of USDT dominance typically indicates that a Bitcoin rally is on the horizon. Stay cautious, but it looks like the market is gearing up for an uptrend. Let's see how the rest of the month plays out, but from where I stand, the upside looks very promising.
 
DISCLAIMER: 
All though I predicted the market at 18K pump, this prediction is still for informational/documentation of my journey and entertainment purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. As with all investments, there are risks involved, and probability-based analysis may not always result in accurate predictions. Always consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

I think funds are still flowing into the coin market.

Therefore, as long as funds flow into the coin market, the coin market is expected to continue its upward trend.


However, I think that it is necessary to adjust the investment ratio because the trading volume is not the same as before (box section).

-----------------------------------------------

(1D chart)

The horizontal line drawn on the chart indicates the volume profile section.

Therefore, the strongest volume profile section at the current price position is around 58697.01.

In addition, the volume profile section currently being formed is 56843.36, 64179.08.

The PVT indicator is a component of the BW indicator.

Since the PVT is currently in a downward trend, we can see that the downward strength is strong.

Therefore, when it rises above 58697.01, it is important to see whether the PVT turns into an upward trend.

-
(1D chart)

If it receives support near 57889.10, it is highly likely that the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator will turn upward.

Therefore, the key is whether it can receive support near 57889.10 and rise above 59053.55.

However, since the current StochRSI indicator is in the overbought zone and has a change in slope, there is a possibility that it will make a short-term high near 57889.10.

If the StochRSI indicator turns downward this time, whether it will receive support near 56150.01-56950.56 is an important key.

-
(1W chart)

If PVT falls below the dotted line on the 1W chart, there is a high possibility that it will turn into a downtrend.

Therefore, you should check whether it can be supported near 57122.77, which is the lower point of the HA-High indicator box on the 1W chart.

--------------------------------------------

Since the trading period is mostly different, the chart analysis will differ depending on which point you start trading from.

Therefore, the points or sections I mentioned are points or sections that can affect the trend.

I think the point that has the greatest influence on the trend change from the current price position is the 57889.10 point.

In order for the trend change to expand, it must break out of the 56150.01-59053.55 section.

-
From a short-term perspective, it seems that it is currently forming a short-term high.

So, to break above this short term high, it needs to be supported above 59053.55.

-
Have a nice time.

Thank you.

Hello everyone,

BTC has successfully closed above the $57,273 level, reversing the previous downward trend. This recovery came after a sharp 3.5% drop, which may have caused panic among some investors.

The next crucial resistance level for Bitcoin is $60,863.

Key Points:

Recovery: Bitcoin closed above $57,273.
Previous Drop: A 3.5% decline created market uncertainty.
Next Resistance: $60,863.
Immediate support: $57,273

As for BTC, I‚Äôm seeing prolonged consolidation with the removal of all levels. Experience tells me that autumn is the "golden time" for crypto, so the BTC fractal might play out, as I‚Äôve shown in detail on the chart.

When you start studying charts, the first thing you learn is about candles.

However, you start studying about the Open, Close, High, and Low of candles.

When you start studying about the Moving Average, you start to think that you understand the charts.

However, when you actually start trading with the Moving Average, you realize that nothing works properly.

So, you start studying other indicators.

-
The above is based on my experience. When you study various charts, you may think you know them, but when you actually start trading, you realize that they don't apply at all.

Where on earth did I go wrong?... What I learned after a long time is that I was wrong from the very beginning.

-
In other words, I realized that my subsequent chart studies were not done properly because I lacked understanding of candles.

When you start studying candles, you study candles of various shapes and patterns.

At this time, you should not be too obsessed with the names of candle shapes or patterns or the conditions that occur and try to memorize them.

It is important to read it repeatedly several times until you can grasp the concept of the arrangements formed by the combination of candle shapes or patterns, that is, the support and resistance points.

Eventually, when the candle shapes or patterns are combined, you can find the volume profile section formed around it, that is, the section where trading volume occurs.

By drawing and marking the support and resistance points you find in this way on 1M, 1W, and 1D charts, you can create a trading strategy on the charts you mainly trade.

That's all the experts in chart analysis say.

In the end, everything is about looking at the combination of candles that make up the chart, finding the corresponding support and resistance points, and trading according to your trading strategy.

A trading strategy is to create a response strategy at the corresponding support and resistance points based on the three things above:
1. Investment period
2. Investment size
3. Trading method and profit realization method

However, since most books do not include trading strategies, you will only learn about the timing of trading and closing of trading using various indicators.

Because of this, there are many cases where you cannot respond to the volatility that occurs after starting trading and end up losing money.

Even so, it is difficult to specifically define the contents of trading strategies.

This is because the investment period, investment size, and trading method are different depending on the individual's investment style.

Therefore, what I can tell you is that you need to set the buy, sell, and stop loss points according to the support and resistance points obtained through chart analysis and wait for a while.

Due to price volatility, you may not touch the buy, sell, and stop loss points or may move past them.

You should learn how to create a trading strategy by modifying the way you respond to these things according to your investment style.

-
One important thing here is that you should mark the support and resistance points in advance through chart analysis before starting trading.

Otherwise, if you start trading and then mark support and resistance points, psychological factors will come into play, which will likely lead to an unexpected transaction.

Don't forget this, and you should practice marking support and resistance points in advance before starting a transaction.

Also, you should avoid analyzing charts after listening to various articles, news, or community content.

The reason is that psychological factors can come into play.

-
I think trading is a response to the movement of prices that fluctuate in real time.

Therefore, waiting and determination are necessary.

If you wait too long or do not make a decision and pass it by, there is a high possibility that you will suffer losses or make little profit, so you need something to refer to when waiting or making a decision.

That is the support and resistance points I mentioned above.

-
However, support and resistance points alone do not solve everything.

Therefore, you should add trend lines and various indicators to ask for a method of responding to price fluctuations.

However, since the trend line is formed by a diagonal line, there is a lack of countermeasure strategies using the trend line.

Therefore, the trend line is used to literally find out what the current trend is.

-
Therefore, when it deviates from the trend line, the movement at the support and resistance points is checked and the corresponding response is made.

When trading with a chart consisting of the above two support and resistance points or only the trend line, there are often cases where the transaction cannot be properly conducted due to fakes or sweeps.

Therefore, in order to counter these fakes or sweeps, various indicators are added to the chart.

The most commonly used of these is the price moving average.

Even if you add the price moving average, you realize that it is a curve, just like the trend line, and is therefore not suitable for countermeasure strategies.

So, the price moving average is also used to check the trend, just like the trend line.

-
In that regard, the indicator I recommend is the StochRSI indicator.

The default settings for the StochRSI indicator are 14, 7, 3, 3 (RSI, Stoch, K, D).

The value of the Signal line (EMA) of the StochRSI indicator is 7.

If the StochRSI indicator rises in the oversold zone and maintains the state of StochRSI > StochRSI EMA, it is a buying period.

On the other hand, if the StochRSI indicator falls in the overbought zone and maintains the state of StochRSI < StochRSI EMA, it is a selling period.

However, you should trade depending on whether there is support or resistance at the support and resistance points formed at that location.

Even if there is movement in the StochRSI indicator, it is recommended not to trade if you do not have support and resistance points drawn on the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts.

The reason is that you may feel psychologically anxious, so there is a possibility that the trade will proceed incorrectly.

-
If you can trade with only what I mentioned above and make an average profit, it is because you have established a trading strategy according to your investment style.

-
We need objective information to establish a trading strategy according to your investment style.

We think that this is the only way to minimize the psychological factors that arise when starting a trade.

If you can add various indicators to the chart to obtain objective information and receive support and resistance point information according to them, you can create a trading strategy according to them at any time.

To do this, we used the StochRSI, OBV, CCI, and RSI indicators to display support and resistance points on the price candle part.

And, we added the StochRSI and BW indicators as auxiliary indicators.

The StochRSI indicator added as an auxiliary indicator is not the StochRSI indicator provided by default, but an indicator with a modified formula, so you can share the chart and use it or copy and paste the TS-BW UP indicator to your own chart and use it.

There is no problem using the basic StochRSI indicator.

However, there is a slight difference from what I said, so there may be a slight problem in understanding.

-
As above, since the support and resistance points of the 1M, 1W, and 1D charts are drawn on the chart to create a trading strategy, my chart is very confusing and not easy to understand when you first look at it.


And, since there are many indicators that I have not explained, it may be even more difficult to see the chart.

Therefore, to resolve the difficult parts, share the chart, hide the indicators added to the chart, and activate them one by one while looking at them, and you will be able to understand the chart.

If you share the chart, you can use it normally, so you can check the chart from various angles.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

Page 6, Article 21: BlackRock is nowhere to be found... And I noticed that lately Michael Saylor hasn't been buying any Bitcoins. What to make of this information?

One way to look at the Bitcoin market from a rookie bullish perspective, is through the story that Bitcoin is strong and cannot move lower because (1) the Spot ETFs (aka. BlackRock) will buy everything and (2) Michael Saylor "bought Bitcoin."

This is a true story.

Bitcoin is still trading at $57,700.

Now, what if you are one of those Spot ETFs and MS Bought Bitcoin kind of person, how are you feeling now that these people are nowhere to be found? Does this lowers your confidence in Bitcoins ability to maintain its current price, or, are we still aiming for 100K next?

The correction is on! and has been ongoing for almost six months now.  We are about to experience what traders call the final "leg down." 

It is very intriguing, I can feel the suspense in the air... But we have bearish action, lower lows and normally, when you are about to experience a very strong rise everything is green, day after day. Right now I am only seeing red.

What do you make of the current situation?
Is Bitcoin going up or down?

Prepare for the crash.

We are trading the altcoins but remember, and this is very important, at first, everything can experience a very strong negative reaction but everything soon stabilises. The smaller ones will recover sooner, some will not even flinch. Others will grow... We looked at this many times through hundreds of charts. 

The big ones, the giants, are going to crash together with Bitcoin. You already know about those.
The altcoins trading against Bitcoin, some are safe but prepare to hold strong for a few days.

The tether pairs are mixed. Each chart should be considered individually.

I am wishing you the best.

Once the correction is over, we will be sharing bullish charts, LONG, until late 2025.
It will be awesome.

I love you.
You are truly appreciated.

Thanks a lot for your amazing support.
I love life.

Namaste.
Page 6, Article 22: BINANCE:BTCUSD  is not falling below 50K, which is expected by many. The flagship continues to consolidate ( which has been going on for half a year now ) and accumulate potential at the expense of some traders or another, mostly at the expense of sellers. Why am I being positive? 

  .

In the second half of August, BTC tried to move into the realization phase and headed towards 70K, but ran into a block of limit orders ( resistance ) at 65K - MM is not ready to let the price go. Having formed a double top, the price returns to the range confirming the fact of false breakdown and liquidation, as a consequence of such actions MM has an interest - liquidity from below ( for this reason I am waiting for initial decline with subsequent growth ). The chart above shows the key zones and possible scenarios to pay attention to when forming your strategy

There is no constructive reason for the formed fall and therefore this movement can be considered purely manipulative, the purpose of which may be to buy up the asset through panic selling as well as prolonged accumulation before realization. 

 Resistance levels: 59600, 60500
Support levels: 58700, 57900, 57736, 56078 

  .

The market is still strong but in a range. Any attempts to sell-off are aggressively bought out by whales ( liquidity withdrawal ). On W1-M1 a stop is forming after a strong rally, which is considered as a controlled consolidation within the bull cycle, which is far from ending. The high probability scenario of that technical nuance is an upward distribution of accumulation. 

 Rate, share your opinion and questions, let's discuss what's going on with ‚òÖ  BINANCE:BTCUSD   ;)

Page 6, Article 23: CRYPTOCAP:BTC  remains in a massive consolidation pattern due to the ETF pump, which overheated the market on the 1W timeframe. The MACD has reset, and we are currently in a downtrend.

However, the chart indicates that we may have reached the bottom at 48k, and we‚Äôre starting to see higher lows. The MACD also shows the potential for a cross at 0, which could signal a reversal within 2 to 4 weeks.

A new rising pattern is emerging, which could be the foundation for an uptrend reversal. If the MACD fails to cross at 0, consolidation may continue for another month or two, causing further pain for altcoins.

That said, we also observe a bullish divergence forming, which is another positive signal. Additionally, USDT dominance is at resistance and could be rejected.

In summary:
- Possible MACD 1W cross and reversal
- Emergence of a rising channel pattern
- USDT dominance at resistance
- RSI in oversold territory

These signs suggest that the market has cooled down and may be ready to resume its upward progress.

Page 7, Article 3: Bitcoin  has entered September 2024 under pressure, following a broader pattern seen in previous years where the month tends to be bearish for the cryptocurrency. Historically, Bitcoin has faced average declines of about 4-7% in September, often driven by a combination of market sentiment and broader macroeconomic factors, such as changes in U.S. monetary policy.

As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $54,700, reflecting a slight rebound after testing lower levels near $52,950, which aligns with the lower Bollinger Band. The market remains largely cautious, with key indicators reflecting mixed signals:

Bollinger Bands and Volatility: Bitcoin is trading between the lower and middle bands, which shows that while it‚Äôs under bearish pressure, it hasn‚Äôt yet fully broken down. Historically, a move below the lower band often signals oversold conditions, leading to a bounce, and we see the price now holding above $53,000. However, volatility remains high, as shown by the ATR (Average True Range) at 958.80, indicating that the swings in price are likely to remain large, adding to the uncertainty.

 Momentum Indicators: 
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) stands at 39.29, signaling mildly oversold conditions. This level suggests that Bitcoin may not face heavy selling pressure from here unless broader market conditions worsen, but it‚Äôs not low enough to confidently call for a strong rebound either.
The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) remains in bearish territory, with the MACD line at -1,017 and the signal line at -944, indicating that downward momentum is still present but might be slowing. The negative histogram at -72.85 further confirms ongoing selling pressure but suggests it‚Äôs not accelerating.
Parabolic SAR and Stochastic Oscillator: The Parabolic SAR is hovering at $54,988, just above the current price, reinforcing that Bitcoin is still in a short-term downtrend. However, the Stochastic Oscillator at %K: 46.27 and %D: 37.77 is showing early signs of a possible bullish crossover, hinting at a potential recovery if buying interest picks up from these levels.

 Short-Term Outlook 
Given the overall technical setup, Bitcoin appears to be in a consolidation phase after a sharp sell-off earlier in the month. The $52,950 level is acting as strong support, and as long as Bitcoin holds above this, the immediate threat of a more significant breakdown seems to be avoided. However, it needs to reclaim the $55,853 middle Bollinger Band to challenge higher resistance levels, especially the upper band at $58,758, which would signal a shift in momentum.

 Market Sentiment and Broader Trends 
In terms of broader sentiment, the market remains cautious due to ongoing speculation about a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could introduce more volatility. Analysts at Bitfinex have pointed out that a rate cut could trigger a deeper correction to $55,000 or lower, potentially pushing Bitcoin as low as $45,000 in a worst-case scenario.

That said, some analysts, including Rekt Capital, expect Bitcoin to consolidate through the rest of September and potentially break out in late September or October, a historically more favorable month for the cryptocurrency. If Bitcoin can hold support and gain momentum heading into October, there‚Äôs potential for it to reverse its current downtrend and push toward higher levels in the mid-to-high $60,000s, particularly if macroeconomic conditions stabilize.

 Conclusion 
Bitcoin‚Äôs current market behavior reflects its usual September weakness, with mixed technical indicators suggesting a period of consolidation. With a key support zone around $53,000 holding firm, the market appears to be waiting for clearer signals, potentially from economic data or broader risk sentiment. A short-term recovery is possible, especially if Bitcoin can clear the $55,800 level, but traders should remain cautious given the historical volatility and upcoming macroeconomic events.
Page 7, Article 4: BTCUSDT continues its downward trend, with a noticeable lack of buying pressure since late August. The price action has been characterized by consistent lower lows and lower closes. Even on the daily chart, we see this pattern persisting, despite a recent false breakout below the July low, with the price hovering near that level again. Historically, September tends to be a difficult month for Bitcoin, often resulting in negative performance. This pattern suggests that the price could drop further, potentially breaking below the 50,000 mark and aiming for the support zone between 48,000 and 45,000. If the price reaches this zone, a strong rebound could occur, potentially sparking a new bullish trend. The target is the support level at 51,220.00

üß†From a structural point of view, the double bottom bullish structure constructed near the buying zone has all the target zones achieved, so we need to be alert to the risk of a pullback.

Page 7, Article 7: If we compare the stock market drops at August 05 and September 03, we can say that the crypto market is still holding up very well.
 But we shouldn't relax, because there are a lot of events coming up in September that will set the tone for the Autumn: 
1Ô∏è‚É£ September 6 - data from the labor market. July 5 and August 5 were extremely volatile downward after the data release. Now the market interprets and considers the most important indicator of the health of the US economy to be not inflation but the number of jobs created. Based on this data, on August 5, the market plunged into a not so pleasant weekend when  CRYPTOCAP:BTC   went below $50K.
2Ô∏è‚É£11 September - publication of the CPI and inflation data in the United States.
3Ô∏è‚É£18 September - the results of the two-day Fed meeting, the announcement of a rate cut. It's elegant that this day is also a full moon, conspiracy theorists are on the base)
4Ô∏è‚É£20 September - a hat trick - a day when stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options expire on the same day. This happens only four times a year - on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, which can lead to a sharp increase in trading volume and volatility.

Page 7, Article 10: Elliot Wave Theory is an absolute favorite of mine, combined with Wyckoff Method and chart analysis (trendlines and technical indicators). If you've been following; you'll know I've been speaking of a multi-month cycle, specifically a multi month corrective wave before the final impulse wave up (4-5).

Considering we're still in that corrective phase, let's take a look at TWO options from here:

 Option 1 , is we retrace around -50%, same as last time. However, this would pose an issue - if we drop lower than (1), it invalidates the Elliot Wave Theory, and also invalidates the bullish cycle. The second problem, is that the previous cycle's increase (2-3) was MUCH bigger than the current 2-3 we are observing. This brings us to option 2.


 Option 2 , is that we retrace around the same ratio as the previous cycle. To calculate the ration, we need to see what % we retraced and compare it to the % increase. 
We increased 1533.92% (2-3)and retraced 55.25% (3-4). That means it's a 3.6% correction compared to the increase.
For the current cycle, we increased 357.27% (2-3) and retraced 33.76% (3-4). This gives us a 9,45% correction - three times as much as the previous cycle.


You can take this two ways -  either we're following a 50% correction, OR we're not falling lower than the current point 4 which is around $49K.

Page 7, Article 11: Current Position: Bitcoin is trading around $58,227, moving within a descending trendline pattern but showing signs of upward momentum as it nears a key horizontal resistance zone between $60,000 and $65,000.

 The major resistance zone is the brown-shaded area between $60,000 and $65,000. A clear breakout above this zone is necessary for a bullish continuation.

 Immediate support is marked by the green descending trendline around $54,000. The next significant support zone is the green area between $43,000 and $46,000, which has historically provided a strong base.

 A breakout above the $65,000 resistance zone could lead to a continuation towards $70,000 and potentially higher levels. Positive momentum indicators would support this scenario.

 If Bitcoin fails to break above the current resistance and faces rejection, it may retest the descending trendline support around $54,000. A drop below this could see Bitcoin revisit the $46,000 support zone or lower.

 Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance zone, and its ability to break through or face rejection will dictate the next significant move. Watch for a decisive move in either direction for confirmation of trend continuation or reversal.

 This analysis is for informational purposes and not financial advice. Stay vigilant with market updates and adjust trading strategies accordingly.
Page 7, Article 12: The BTC/USDT weekly chart shows Bitcoin currently trading near $54,996, testing a descending trendline and a key horizontal resistance zone between $60,000 and $65,000.
There is a significant support zone between $43,000 and $46,000, which Bitcoin has respected in the past. This zone could serve as a strong base for a potential bounce if tested.

The highlighted resistance zone around $60,000 to $65,000 remains a critical area that Bitcoin needs to break above to confirm a bullish continuation.
The green support zone between $43,000 and $46,000 is the immediate downside target if Bitcoin continues to face selling pressure. Below this level, the ascending trendline offers additional support around the $40,000 level.
Potential Scenarios:

 If Bitcoin can hold above the $55,000 mark and push through the overhead resistance, we could see a rally towards the next psychological level of $70,000 and beyond. The upper arrow on the chart suggests optimism for a potential breakout.
 A failure to hold above current levels might lead to a retest of the lower support zones around $46,000, and potentially lower if market conditions worsen.

A weekly close above $65,000 would provide a strong bullish signal, indicating a potential continuation toward all-time highs.
Monitoring volume and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD on the weekly timeframe could provide early signals of a trend reversal or continuation.

The presence of a descending triangle pattern indicates potential consolidation before a major move. Market sentiment will play a key role in dictating the direction of the next breakout.
Broader market factors, including macroeconomic data and overall crypto market health, will influence BTC's price action.

Traders should watch the key support levels closely and consider stop-loss placements just below the $43,000 zone to manage risk effectively.
It's important to adjust positions based on Bitcoin's price action around these critical zones, especially near major support and resistance levels.
This weekly update provides an overview of the key levels and potential scenarios for BTC/USDT. With Bitcoin currently at a crossroads near important resistance, market participants should closely monitor for breakout or breakdown signals in the coming weeks.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Stay updated with market movements and adjust your trading strategy accordingly. Keep an eye out for further updates and analysis. Thank you!
Page 7, Article 13: So, here we are. Hope these updates helped a little in navigating what has not been an easy market at all. Predicting these moves is near impossible, but we can look at possible zones and levels where we might interact with price and prepare for multiple scenarios.

We have cleaned up a lot of bad lows we had, only to sweep a previous low by $10. Technically that's a sweep, in reality it's not a very convincing one.

Open Interest declined a little bit, but not by any meaningful amount: there are still 30-40k contracts that opened during the $55-60k range, that's a bit troublesome still.

Previous plans:

It's a bit unclear, so we'll have to monitor as we go. Going by the squiggles, we lost GP and are now in the red path. On the other hand, we can see it as yellow that just went a little deeper.

It will depend a bit how much time we spend down here, but I'd disregard anything that happens over the weekend since price is just naturally drifting up to fill the imbalance we left.

Ideal scenario is the blue path I've added: sweep the recent low on Monday or Tuesday, but quick reclaim, then take out the bad highs around 60k. Then we take it from there.
Page 7, Article 14: Money flowing out of Bitcoin will flow to the Altcoins?

How are you feeling today my dear reader?
I am hoping you are having a wonderful week.

Just as a friendly reminder, Bitcoin's correction is not yet over and $40,000 is likely NOT the bottom of this corrective phase.

How low it truly goes it is an open ended question but it is something that will surprise most participants, as usual.

Why would Bitcoin move lower?
Why not 100K?

The market moves in cycles and it tends to seek balance.

A prolonged bullish wave, 16 months, is matched by a strong correction.
It is just the way it works.

This is normal market action and this should not discourage anybody... We are full green for 2025 and the only troublesome period is between now and October.

The "trouble" period for Bitcoin is August 2024 and September 2024.
October 2024, November 2024 and December 2024 is neutral and recovery.

January 2025 and February 2025, is back to high prices and green.  Then we will see massive growth in 2025 until we hit a new All-Time High of around $190,000.  More or less.

Hold strong throughout the correction.

Consider the altcoins. Many hit bottom. It is wise to buy those trading low and sell those trading high. Trading 101. Simplicity is key.

Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions.

Namaste.
Page 7, Article 15: Bitcoin surged above $58K during today's trading session on the back of a recovery in US tech stocks and gains in Asian stock markets.
After the game can still maintain this key point, which provides strong support for the next rise. Bitcoin will further return to the $60K position over the weekend or next week, so the $70K position is not far away.
As for this period, I set two goals, 59.5K and 63K.
Page 7, Article 16: Current Analysis: BTC/USDT is trading within a descending channel on the 2-hour chart, suggesting that Bitcoin is in a short-term downtrend. However, BTC is currently testing the lower boundary of the channel and is showing signs of a potential bounce.

 The lower boundary of the channel is around $56,200 - $56,500.
The upper boundary of the channel near $58,500 - A breakout above this could confirm a bullish reversal.

Monitor for an increase in volume, which could signal the strength of the move if BTC attempts to break out of the channel.
RSI: Currently in a neutral zone, suggesting no immediate overbought or oversold conditions.

 A breakout above $58,500 with strong volume could trigger a move towards the next resistance levels around $60,000 and beyond.
Continued Downtrend: If BTC fails to break out and loses the $56,200 support level, it could continue to trend lower within the channel, targeting $55,000 or even lower.
Trading Plan:

Consider entering a long position on a confirmed breakout above the channel with a target of $60,000 and a stop loss just below the breakout level.
If BTC fails to hold the lower boundary and breaks below $56,200, consider shorting with a target of $55,000 and a stop loss above $57,000.

 This is not financial advice. Keep a close watch on BTC's price action for rapid changes, and adjust your strategy as necessary. Stay tuned for further updates and analysis. Thank you!
Page 7, Article 17: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, more than 30,000 Bitcoins have been transferred to Binance earlier today...

In a previous article, we mentioned the best case scenario and the idea of ignoring the worst case scenario, this can be a mistake. The truth is that Bitcoin, the Cryptocurrency market, tends to surprise, always, either on the bullish or bearish side. Regardless of what happens, it is always wise to consider all scenarios.

The altcoins are correcting below our baseline, which we defined as the price level at which these projects traded around January 2024. The truth is that most altcoins are going back to October 2023 price levels. This is the same price at which the market traded before the major 2023/24 bullish wave; after the long consolidation phase.

Some altcoins did even worse and went lower to break below their June 2023 low and others broke down even further, including big and highly recognized projects, and crashed below their May/June 2022 low reaching new All-Time Lows. Bitcoin is currently trading at the same price it traded back in April/March 2024; very high by all standards.

The higher it trades, and the longer it takes to drop, the stronger the strength of the bearish move. This is called bearish consolidation, which in turn is a distribution phase. The distribution phase is termed so because the big players and large Bitcoin holders distribute their coins to the rest of the market.

Just as a long six months bullish consolidation (accumulation) phase led to a massive bullish rise. In reverse, a long six months bearish consolidation (distribution) phase can lead to a massive bearish crash.

Bitcoin grew just like certain altcoins, it did better than most. Only a few projects grew more than Bitcoin in terms of previous past action. Meaning, only a few projects moved to hit new All-Time Highs. It was Bitcoin and these few. The rest produced a strong wave in late 2023, others minimum growth.

While we know and assume that Bitcoin isn't likely to crash as the altcoins, because of its size and fame, look what happened to Ethereum... And Ethereum is gearing up for another round of the same. The same dynamic where Junk-base is buying billions of Ether to sell to Spot ETF holders at a low price continue. They are accumulating to sell en-mass.

Hope for the best; prepare for the worst.

The best scenario puts Bitcoin at $40,000 as the correction bottom. This can easily still be true.

A stronger correction would send Bitcoin lower toward the $33,000 - $36,000 price range.

A doom scenario and things getting really bad, for whatever reason because things tend to develop always as a surprise, would be Bitcoin between $33,000 and $26,000 on a wick. $26,000 is the price at which Bitcoin traded in October 2023, which is before the final impulse that led to our newest and latest All-Time High of $73,777.

Regardless of the general perception, such a move wouldn't change much in how Bitcoin continues to grow and evolve in the long-term. This can happen if some unforeseen event hits the market. Also because we have about 3 weeks of continued bearish action, which is plenty of time for everything to show up. The least expected scenario is always the one that comes to pass.

There is always good news... The stronger the correction, the stronger the recovery that will follow.

The stronger the panic, the stronger is the lesson that the market participants will learn.

The bigger the shock, the stronger the market reaction and after the recovery happens, more confidence in the system develops and everybody will know for certain, forever that Bitcoin is here to stay.

I am not saying that we will necessarily see $26K but, prepare for the worst... Just in case.

Namaste.

üß†We have been consolidating sideways in the selling zone for a long time. After finally digesting the selling pressure in this range, we chose to continue to break upward, so the selling zone turned into a support zone. At present, we have reached the stage resistance zone, and we do not recommend that you chase the rise in this range.

‚û°Ô∏èThe next resistance is located near the downward trend line (around 61k). If we develop relatively strongly, then the extreme resistance is located near the turning point 65175, which is also an ideal target area for the bull structure.

‚û°Ô∏èTherefore, we have locked in about 80% of the main profit, and will allow the remaining positions to wait for the ideal target without risk. üôèüéØ

The downward retest on Wednesday 11 September did not reach 49K, it stopped at 52550. 

Moving forward I don't expect price to fall below @ 57041. That's close to the open on Thursday 12 September, which is the day that Mercury left His previous retrograde zone. I myself will try to get a fill to go long near Thursday's low.

  

On Monday 16 September Sun enters Virgo and reaches Venus's position of Sunday 25 August.

Bitcoin price will retest and  pass  65K on this date, continuing upwards.

After that I See bitcoin taking out its previous highs, because the next major downtrend only begins when Mars enters Cancer on Sunday 20 October. But for this leg up I hope to take profit at about 68K and then assess where to re-enter.

Page 7, Article 20: My expectations from the previous post have materialized, and the price of Bitcoin has dropped again into the price imbalance zone below 53,500. My expectations for Bitcoin's price next week are as follows: due to negative economic news, the stock market will likely continue to decline for several more days starting on Monday. Since Bitcoin's price correlates with key indices like the S&P and Dow Jones, there is a high probability that Bitcoin will continue to decline, potentially reaching as low as 48,900.

If we look at the Long-Term Holder Realized Profit/Loss Ratio 7D indicator, which unfortunately is not yet available publicly on the TradingView platform, based on this data, Bitcoin is currently in an accumulation phase before a major growth season. Similar patterns occurred during the 2011 and 2021 market seasons.

Page 7, Article 23: TLDR: 
My base case is that next week, Bitcoin will make another LL. I expect volatility and at least one shakeout. Ultimately, Bitcoin will reach a low between 47K ‚Äì 49K. 
After making the low, bitcoin will begin a relief rally, lasting until after the Fed meeting on September 17th. My analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs reaction to the previous rate cut in 2020 points to a temporary relief rally and a resumption of the downtrend. However, this rally can be savage and even go beyond the previous high of 65K. 
If I am correct, next week will be extremely difficult to trade. My best bet is to wait for 49K to get hit and buy with low leverage or wait for a trend reversal confirmation. 
I realize I strayed from the conventional interpretation of a corrective WXYZ. Some of you were kind enough to reach out and offer your opinion. I will include these as alternative scenarios. 

 Bitcoin Macro Outlook: 

I believe Bitcoin is in the final stages of a complex wave four correction. After This correction period, I expect a continuation in wave five to around 80K. 
 Where do I draw the line? 
Price: A weekly close below 43.6K, which is the 0.618 of wave 3.
Time: if this correction lasts after October 2024.  
Figure 1: Macro Outlook. 
  
Figure 2: Bitcoin Correction Price & Time Limits. 
  

 Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook: 

The selling pressure on Bitcoin is close to exhaustion. However, I still expect the price to make an LL next week. 
I outlined the path the price will take. ‚ÄúNo plan survives first contact with the enemy‚Äù (Helmuth von Moltke). The vital part of the plan is for the price to make a double-bottom scenario at around 49K. Invalidation is next.
Figure 3: Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook. 
  

 Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook Invalidation: 

Bitcoin holds the trendline and advances in a triangle breakout. 
This scenario is less likely for two reasons:
1. Because of the violation of the Gann Angle (2/1). 
2. The daily wick from August 5th has yet to be filled. 
Figure 4: Bitcoin Short-Term Invalidation. 
  
Figure 5: Gann Angles & Wick Fill. 
  

 Time Over Price:  

Gann believed that "Time is the most important factor of all." He argued that when sufficient time has elapsed, it could overbalance price, leading to a change in market trends. 
My premise is that we are due for a short relief rally after next week. Whatever happens after September 14th, I will look for long trades. 

Best Wishes
Page 8, Article 1: üìä#BTC is still in the selling zone‚úîÔ∏è

üß†From a structural perspective, we are still within the target area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe double bottom bullish structure, and we still need to be alert to the occurrence of a callback before completely breaking through this range.

‚û°Ô∏èIf you want to participate in long trading, you need to wait patiently for the target area to break through. After the target area turns into a support area, you can then look for opportunities to enter the long position in this range.

‚û°Ô∏èIf we fail to break through the target zone and return to the support zone again, then we can consider participating in some new long trades.

Page 8, Article 2: I have been following the Bitcoin price action locally quite often, and would like to strategize a plan based on the current price action on the charts. 

At the moment, I believe we will likely move up to approx $60k to test the Value Area Low of the previous 6 month range. I do believe we will see seller's step in at that level and bring price back down below $50k where the low of the range liquidity can be taken and shoot right back up to grab the liquidity sitting above $70k. 

Being that rate cuts are quickly approaching, Im sure there will be some turbulence in the markets , especially around the election time. This uncertainty may bring us some amazing opportunities if we are well prepared.
Page 8, Article 3: Understanding the Business Cycle and the Strategic Importance of Holding Bitcoin Through Economic Phases 

The four phases of the business cycle‚ÄîEarly Expansion, Maturing Expansion, Late Expansion, and Recession‚Äîeach play a crucial role in shaping economic activities, investment trends, and asset performances. For those engaged in crypto trading and investment, particularly within the Global Miranda Miner Research Group, it's essential to understand how Bitcoin fits into these phases and why holding onto Bitcoin, especially during the Recession phase, can be a strategic move.

Early Expansion: The Foundation of Growth
The Early Expansion phase is marked by the economy's recovery from a recession. During this phase, employment rates start to rise, business profits increase, and consumer confidence is restored. This period is characterized by heightened investments in sectors like Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Industrials, Information Technology, and Real Estate. Notably, Bitcoin, as a technology-driven asset, tends to attract investors looking for growth opportunities in innovative markets.

Coach Miranda Miner, a respected figure in cryptocurrency education, emphasizes the importance of recognizing Bitcoin's potential during this phase. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group highlights that as investor sentiment shifts towards growth and innovation, Bitcoin's role as a pioneering asset becomes more prominent. Those who invest in Bitcoin during the Early Expansion phase can potentially benefit from its growth trajectory as the economy continues to strengthen.

Maturing Expansion: The Peak of Economic Growth
As the economy moves into the Maturing Expansion phase, growth reaches its peak. Inflation pressures begin to emerge, and the economic environment becomes more complex. Investment strategies typically shift towards sectors such as Communication Services, Financials, Industrials, Information Technology (including Bitcoin), and Real Estate.

According to insights from the Global Miranda Miner Research Group, this phase is a critical juncture for Bitcoin investors. Coach Miranda Miner advises that while the market may experience volatility due to inflation concerns, Bitcoin's inherent properties‚Äîsuch as its limited supply and decentralized nature‚Äîposition it as a potential hedge against inflation. Investors within the crypto community are encouraged to maintain their Bitcoin holdings during this phase, as it can serve as a safeguard against traditional market fluctuations.

Late Expansion: Navigating Slowdowns and Strategic Positioning
The Late Expansion phase is characterized by a slowdown in economic growth. Interest rates may rise in response to inflationary pressures identified during the Maturing Expansion phase. During this period, investments often shift towards more defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Energy, Financials, Health Care, Materials, and Real Estate.

For Bitcoin investors, this phase requires a strategic approach. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group suggests that while traditional markets may start to feel the strain of rising interest rates, Bitcoin‚Äôs unique attributes could provide a buffer. Coach Miranda Miner points out that as economic conditions become more uncertain, holding Bitcoin can serve as a valuable counterbalance to more traditional assets, potentially offering protection against economic slowdowns.

Recession: The Opportunity to Accumulate and Hold
The Recession phase, where economic activity contracts, is often viewed with apprehension by investors. Jobs may be eliminated, and interest rates typically begin to decline as the economy attempts to stabilize. During this phase, investments generally focus on defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples, Energy, Health Care, and Utilities.

However, the Global Miranda Miner Research Group views the Recession phase as a prime opportunity for Bitcoin accumulation. Coach Miranda Miner strongly advocates for holding Bitcoin through this phase, emphasizing that historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience during economic downturns. The Recession phase often leads to a flight to safety, where investors seek assets that are less correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized and finite nature, stands out as a potential store of value in these uncertain times.

The Strategic Importance of Holding Bitcoin
Across all phases of the business cycle, the consistent theme promoted by Coach Miranda Miner and the Global Miranda Miner Research Group is the importance of holding Bitcoin. While the Early Expansion and Maturing Expansion phases may present opportunities for growth and profits, it is during the Late Expansion and Recession phases that the strategic value of Bitcoin becomes more apparent.

Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to act as a hedge against inflation, its independence from central bank policies, and its limited supply make it a unique asset in an investor's portfolio. The Global Miranda Miner Research Group advises that by maintaining a long-term perspective and holding Bitcoin through various economic cycles, investors can position themselves to benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs potential appreciation, particularly in post-recession recoveries.

Coach Miranda Miner often underscores the value of patience and conviction in cryptocurrency investment. The cyclical nature of the economy suggests that downturns are followed by recoveries. Investors who hold Bitcoin during challenging economic periods are often rewarded when the economy rebounds, and Bitcoin‚Äôs value appreciates in response to renewed investor confidence.

Conclusion: Navigating the Business Cycle with Bitcoin
Understanding the four phases of the business cycle is essential for any investor, particularly those involved in the cryptocurrency space. For members of the Global Miranda Miner Research Group and followers of Coach Miranda Miner, recognizing the strategic importance of holding Bitcoin through these phases is crucial. While each phase presents its own set of challenges and opportunities, the consistent advice is clear: Bitcoin, with its unique characteristics, should be held as a long-term asset.

By embracing this strategy, investors can potentially safeguard their portfolios against economic uncertainties and position themselves to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs growth as the economy moves through its cycles. In the words of Coach Miranda Miner, "In the world of crypto, patience is a virtue, and holding Bitcoin through the storm often leads to brighter days

Page 8, Article 4: Our gameplan on the weekly timeframe remains the same, and we‚Äôre still hovering around the resistance zone after several tests.

As the price starts to pull away from this zone and sellers gradually take control, we‚Äôre now setting our eyes on the $40K neckline zone. Ideally, this move would bring the RSI into the oversold territory, creating a potential buying opportunity that could push the price towards $50K.

This gameplan will continue to be our guide over the next few months as we monitor how the market behaves.

Page 8, Article 5: The BTC/USDT daily chart displays a descending channel pattern with a recent test of the lower trendline, indicating a key support area.
The price has recently bounced from the lower boundary near $52,408, showing a potential reversal toward the upper trendline.
The critical support level is highlighted at $52,408. A successful defense of this level could serve as a strong foundation for a bullish move.
The nearest resistance is the descending upper trendline of the channel, currently around $66,000. A breakout above this level could signal the start of a new bullish phase.
Potential Bullish Scenario:

The chart suggests a possible rally from the current levels, with the price potentially moving towards $66,000.
If the price breaks above the channel resistance, it could trigger a larger bullish momentum targeting previous highs or beyond.
Bearish Consideration:

A failure to sustain above $52,408 could lead to a downside continuation towards the next significant support levels around $50,000 or lower.
Monitoring for false breakouts or rejections near the resistance trendline will be essential to manage risk.
Pattern Analysis:

The ongoing consolidation resembles a broadening formation, with increasing volatility at the boundaries of the pattern.
The large upward arrow on the chart indicates a projected move higher, suggesting optimism among traders for a breakout.
Key Takeaways:

A sustained move above the $54,000-$55,000 range with strong volume could validate the bullish scenario.
Positioning should account for both scenarios with stops below $52,000 to mitigate downside risk if the support level fails.
This analysis points towards a cautious optimism for BTC, with critical resistance levels needing to be cleared to confirm a bullish continuation. Keep an eye on the volume and price action around the resistance trendline for further confirmation.

Page 8, Article 6: BTC price retraced and bounced off 0.786 fib so i expect this uptrend to be a bit weak and should go up till 65K before reversing. Will look for a sell entry in this position .
Page 8, Article 7: Clear market structure is very important to trading

The dominant trend (higher time cycles) guide the lower ones

When it's ranged for days, the lower time frames are still tradable but with a higher risk 

Wherever you place your trades, ensure they are protected (don't go too big)
Page 8, Article 8: Bitcoin is right now doing a big stop hunt above the $58k level but closes negative/small positive body + big wick. I could see $56k as the next target because there are some clusters of liquidity.
Page 8, Article 9: Hello, I'm Whale_signal

Before that, we'll review the 1H-BTCUSDT chart

The problematic spot was an hour stick, showing a flow of settling the orange whale surface, and then a sharp drop came out immediately

There are probably people who hosted LONG on that spot

1. If you have made a buy on Whale Indicators, you should designate an entry price cut right away
-> Whale indicators are strong indicators, so if they break, which direction? We don't know how much the price will be pushed
-> Profit is important, but risk response comes first

2. There's been a $250 rise from the orange whale indicator and $250 in the futures market is definitely not a small profit
-> Even if you didn't eat $250, you could have avoided a big loss if you designated it as a stopper

I don't feel good because there might be people who lost money. From now on, please make sure to proceed with the stoppage


1H - BTCUSDT Update


It's a very complicated seat. I think it'll help, so I've added a white whale indicator

If it fails to rise above the orange whale index, it could continue to face downward pressure, and if it deviates below, it could see mid to late 46K to late 47K

And if the mid to late 46K to 47K are also breached, please refer to the 1D-BTCUSDT purple whale indicator

You have to be careful because it's continuously being pushed down and it's located under the purple whale indicator

Page 8, Article 10: We have two signals here to consider: Moving Averages and Candlesticks.

Let's start with the moving averages because it is the easiest of the two.

‚ûñ Bitcoin moved below EMA8/13/21 weekly in July. After trading two weeks below, it recovered last week. This week we have a full rejection and the action is back below these moving averages. This is an ultra-bearish signal and confirms the bearish bias and potential. Major crash confirmed.

Now the candlesticks.

‚ûñ Bitcoin closed below the "weekly support" only once in 2024, that is in early July. After this close, it quickly recovered. Bitcoin traded 7 weeks above this level, blue line on the chart, and this week is closing below it.

‚ûñ A close below this level, confirmed within less than two hours, confirms major crash. This would be the weakest close since February 2024 if we skip the July candle.

üëâ In simple terms, these signals are pointing to a crash toward $43,000 and $38,000 within the coming weeks. No bullish signals are present. Everything is extremely bearish. Run for your life.

‚û°Ô∏èAt present, we are near the resistance zone and the downward trend line, and there is an expectation of resistance and a fall, so even if we are bullish, we need to wait for a period of correction before participating. The next strong resistance is near 57.3k.

Page 8, Article 14: DISCLAIMER: This is not trade advice. This is for educational and entertainment purposes only to demonstrate how I intend to participate in this market. Trading involves real risk. Do your own due diligence.

People like myself (with average-to-below average intelligence) need a simple strategy. 
My "Ducks in a Barrel" strategy is exactly that. Simple. Clear. Rules Based. Effective. Zero Discretion.

BTC (and several other cryptos, for that matter), are setup for "Ducks in a Barrel" long trades. Lets review the process for identifying these setups. To be clear, this is not a "long now" post. This market is SETUP. This is not a timing tool. We get into the market once we get a technical long TRIGGER on the Daily timeframe. From there, we FOLLOW THROUGH on the trade by managing risk and maximizing profit. Without the TRIGGER, we have not trade.

 STEP 1:  Identify a market with a strong trend on the weekly timeframe. I utilize the 39 and 52 period MA. For uptrends, we want to see both MA's sloping up and pulling away from each other. We see on BTC that the two MA's are still upward sloping and pulling away from each other. This confirms step 1, that we are in a strong uptrend.
 
STEP 2:  We need at least 2 of the following to be in unison with the direction we want to trade (in the case of BTC, we need 2 of these to support the long idea).
VALUATION: For longs, we need an undervaluation vs Gold &/or Treasuries.
STOCHASTIC: For longs, we need to see the market is oversold.
SENTIMENT: For longs, we want to see Bearish advisor sentiment (we fade the public sentiment).

 STEP 3:  We see that BTC is Oversold on the Stochastic and is Undervalued vs Gold & Treasuries. This meets our criteria of 2/3 indicators supporting our idea. This market is now SET UP for longs. Now we wait for the TRIGGER.

 STEP 4:  We are waiting for Step 4 in Bitcoin right now. We need to see an entry TRIGGER on the daily timeframe via one of the following entry techniques.
18 Period MA Entry
10 high 8 close MAC w/ Williams Acc/Dis 57 MA Confirmation Entry
Stop either 150% of 3 Period ATR, or 2 times the width of the MAC, whichever is greater.
There are other entry techniques, but they are higher risk. The two entry techniques above will not catch the absolute bottom, but will ensure that you are buying into a confirmed trend change. Other entry techniques come with the risk of trying to "bottom/top" pick, which increases your odds of several losses prior to the real move occuring.

If you have questions about the "Ducks in a Barrel" strategy, feel free to shoot me a message.

I hope you all have a great week.

And as always.....

Good Luck & Good Trading.
Page 8, Article 15: Main Concept 
 
 The core idea behind the Super Trend Reversals indicator is to assess the momentum of automated trading bots (often referred to as 'Supertrend bots') that enter the market during critical turning points. Specifically, the indicator is tuned to identify when the market is nearing bottoms or peaks, but just before it shifts direction based on the triggered Supertrend signals. This approach helps traders engage with the market right as the reversal momentum builds up, allowing for entry just as conditions become favorable and exit before momentum wanes.
 
 How It Works 
 
 The Super Trend Reversals uses multiple Supertrend calculations, each with different period and multiplier settings, to form a comprehensive view of the trend. The total trend score from these calculations is then analyzed using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to gauge the strength and sustainability of the trend.
 A key feature of this indicator is the isCurrentRangeSmaller() function, which evaluates if the current price range is lower than the average over the recent period. This function is critical as it helps determine the stability of the market environment, reducing the likelihood of entering or exiting trades based on erratic price movements that could lead to false signals.
Page 8, Article 16: Based on the new economics data we received the past week I expect a further dump for BTC at least till the FED rates day (19th). However, based on the all-in short mentality by traders, I expect some nice spikes during that time.

(1D chart)

As I mentioned in the idea yesterday, the key is whether it can be supported around 56150.01-56950.56 and rise above the M-Signal indicator on the 1W chart.

Before that, we need to check whether it can rise above the MS-Signal (M-Signal on the 1D chart) indicator and maintain the price by rising above 57889.10.

If it fails to rise above the MS-Signal indicator, it is likely to fall to around 52137.67.

-

The IBIT BTC ETF chart looks a little different in that there is a gap between the MS-Signal indicator and the IBIT indicator.

The location of the StochRSI indicator is also different.

On the BTCUSDT chart, it is just before entering the overbought zone, but on the IBIT chart, it is located near the 50 point.

Therefore, we need to check at what point the StochRSI indicator of the two charts enters the overbought zone and receives support.

-
It is expected that a full-scale volatility period will begin.

Since this volatility period was set on the 1W chart, it is likely to continue until September 29, so caution is required when trading.



If USDT or USDC continues to gap up, it is expected to continue to rise after the volatility period.

-
Have a good time.
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------

- ‚Äã‚ÄãBig picture

It is expected that a full-scale uptrend will begin when it rises above 29K.

The range expected to be touched in the next bull market is 81K-95K.

#BTCUSD 12M

1st: 44234.54
2nd: 61383.23
3rd: 89126.41

4th: 13401.28
151166.97-157451.83 (overshooting)
5th: 178910.15

These are points where resistance is likely to occur in the future.
We need to check if these points can be broken upward.

We need to check the movement when this section is touched because I think a new trend can be created in the overshooting section.

If the major uptrend continues until 2025, it is expected to start forming a pull back pattern after rising to around 57014.33.

BTCUSDT - I think it's a section where we're pulling together by breaking through the 1H falling channel upward


In addition, we think that if we break through a certain price range in the future, we can show the possibility of a trend change

It will be a very important position for investors

The section will be shown in the *whale indicator real-time chart sharing below

Potential early close/partial $55000

70% profit target $54000
Potential full close at $51000

Eventually I anticipate market to reach back to the $47000-45000 area to create a potential bottom.

And for this week I think we'll probably hit 50k. So this short right here could be the potential start of the move.

For me its a matter of when at this point not if bitcoin will make new lows. Its all about probabilities and based on my analysis that's where price is likely to go.

Page 9, Article 6: Market Analysis: 

The current market structure for Bitcoin (BTC) is exhibiting bearish tendencies. The price is approaching a significant high level, and there are potential selling pressures near the Order Block and Point of Interest (POI). Additionally, the Fibonacci Golden Zone is a critical area to watch.

 Trade Recommendation: 

If the price breaks below 55,100, it could indicate a surge in selling pressure. To capitalize on this potential downtrend, consider a short position.

 Trade Details: 

 Entry:  Sell BTCUSDT below 55,080
 Target:  54,400 - 54,000 - 53,800
 Stop Loss:  300-500 points

 Rationale: 

 Bearish Structure:  The overall market structure suggests a bearish trend.
 Order Block and POI:  These areas often act as resistance levels, and a break below them could trigger a sell-off.
 Fibonacci Golden Zone:  This zone represents a significant price level that could offer resistance.
 Liquidity:  The presence of large liquidity levels at 54,400 - 54,188 could provide support for a potential price decline.
 
Note:  This is a general recommendation based on the current market analysis. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any trading decisions.

The above purple whale indicator (with whale photo) showed a precise touch and a $1300 rise


Unfortunately, other rooms and real-time chart sharing should consider the above purple whale indicators (the section with whale photos) as important. The explanation has been emphasized additionally and consistently (with certification)

As expected, I was able to get a good return by breaking through the second purple whale indicator (the section with whale photos)


Now, you can look at the purple whale index at the top

Welcome to the quick update of  BTCUSDT . We have seen BTC touch the levels of $ 52500  and retrace a bit until $ 58000  but couldn't hold it.

We can see it dumping and is currently trading around $56100.

The next levels to watch out for are  $54700 and $53800 . If this holds, we can see BTC pump again and might make a new high in a few months.

 Support levels: $54700. $53900, $49600 in the long run.

Resistance levels: $58027, $61100, $64000, and $72000 in the long run. 

Let's wait and see how this pans out. Until then, stay tuned and trade with caution, ensuring strict  STOPLOSSES !!

Page 9, Article 15: Any deviation from the variables outlined here cancels the scenario and requires reassessment.

From $57,000, I expect a correction to the 4-hour imbalance, followed by an impulse up to $61,000-$62,000, where short positions can be considered. The target would be the imbalance likely forming around the $56,000-$57,000 range, from where we could fuel up for a move to $65,000. At $65,000, it's highly probable a short position with a target of $49,000 will be the best option.

However, if during the rise to $65,000, an area of interest forms on the weekly timeframe, I will not enter a short at $65,000 and will wait to see how things unfold with the new variables in mind.

Page 9, Article 17: Accounting for manipulation to the upside, the general sentiment from the crypto as a whole is bearish so anticipating a relief rally before a continued sell-off into $50,000 seems reasonable right??
Page 9, Article 18: No matter who will be USA president, Bitcoin price will only go up
Page 9, Article 19: Bitcoin has been putting is some near term lower highs and lower lows. 

The daily chart trend is starting to breakdown and show signs of distribution. 

The weekly chart trend is still ok but even if we had a flush to 40k the Weekly chart would still display higher lows. 

The point of this higher low excercise is to define trend and know that trends can often have a large range. 

That being said I think a short setup in BTC is brewing. a retest of the 50 & 100  MA will likely prove to be very strong resistance as we keep losing the key larger term MA's. 

As banks and potentially the stock market lose some momentum its going to be interesting to see how crypto is going to hold up.

- **Target:** $41,860 (Liquidity Area)  
- **Stop Loss:** Above $65,300

**Rationale:**  
- The price is approaching a key supply zone where a reversal due to selling pressure is expected.  
- Price action is in a bearish structure, with the potential to make a lower low targeting the liquidity area below $42,000.  
- There‚Äôs a liquidity pool at $41,860, which could be the final target after trapping long positions.  
- Stop-loss is placed above the supply zone to limit risk in case the price breaks higher.
Page 10, Article 6: Hello everyone, let's look at the current BTC situation considering the one hour interval.  In this situation, we can see how the price has moved higher from the local downtrend line above which it remains.
  Let's start by setting goals for the near future, which include:
T1- 60252$
T2- 62340$
T3- 64922$
  Now let's move on to the stop-loss in case the market continues to decline:
  SL1 = $58,076
  SL2 = $56,190
  SL3 = $555,256 AND
  SL4 = $54,044

  Looking at the RSI indicator, we see a movement at the upper limit, which may influence an attempt to recover or give a temporary sideways trend.
Page 10, Article 7: Current Range: BTC is trading within a significant horizontal range between approximately $52,000 (support) and $68,000-$72,000 (resistance). This range has been respected since March 2024, with several bounces between these levels.

Descending Channel Breakout: Recently, BTC has broken out of a descending channel pattern (marked by the white lines). This breakout suggests a potential shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. If this breakout holds, BTC may see a continuation of upward movement.
 Around $54,000 (near the green trendline), which has acted as a strong support level throughout this range.
The upper boundary of the range near $68,000-$72,000 remains the key level to watch for any potential breakout to the upside.

If BTC continues to hold above the breakout level and gains momentum, the next major resistance will be the upper range boundary near $68,000-$72,000. A successful breakout above this level could potentially target higher levels around $76,000.


If BTC fails to maintain the breakout and falls below the descending channel, we could see a retest of the lower support around $54,000. A break below this level would likely lead to a test of the lower range boundary around $52,000 or even lower levels.
Momentum indicators like RSI or MACD were not included in the chart, but adding these could confirm the breakout's strength.
BTC/USDT shows potential for further upside following the breakout from the descending channel, with key levels to watch at $68,000-$72,000 for resistance and $54,000 as immediate support. As long as BTC maintains above the breakout level, the bias remains bullish, but caution is warranted near the upper boundary of the range.


Disclaimer: This analysis is for informational purposes and not financial advice. Always stay updated with market movements and adjust your trading strategies as needed.
Page 10, Article 8: It continues to look more likely that Bitcoin has put in a higher low at $52,500, although this will not be confirmed until we break above $65,000. There is nothing meaningful on the chart, but it is encouraging to see price back in the range and continuing to head up. 

September is almost halfway over!
Page 10, Article 9: Last week, the price closed below the previous low, forming another lower low. This further confirms that Bitcoin is in a bearish trend, which has been ongoing for the past six months.

The crucial level at the moment is $64,220 (the last formed high). This key level separates us from a bullish (upward) trend. If the price on the weekly timeframe can break this level and close above it, it will be a very important indicator of a trend reversal. Until then, we remain in a bearish trend.

Page 10, Article 11: The 2-hour BTCUSDT chart shows a prevailing downtrend, with the price currently moving below the EMA 34 and EMA 89 lines.

Key Resistance: The 55,000 USD level is a strong resistance, as the price has tested it and failed to break through. The key support lies around 53,000 USD.

BTC is likely to retest the EMA 34 around 55,000 USD before continuing its downward move. If the resistance holds, the downtrend may persist, pushing the price down to the support area near 50,400 USD in the coming days.

In terms of news: The cryptocurrency market is under pressure due to uncertainty surrounding U.S. monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rate expectations from the Federal Reserve.
Page 10, Article 12: Greetings, everyone.üòâ

I would like to present a scenario for your consideration, grounded in  "Elliott Wave Theory" .

 

 ‚úîÔ∏è Wave initiated from the 15K level: Classified as a "Double Zigzag"
‚úîÔ∏è Current wave in development: Y-c-3
‚úîÔ∏è Projected upward range: 93K ~ 101K 

The rationale behind this analysis is as follows:

 
 Zigzag patterns typically move within a parallel channel.
 The first zigzag wave, which started from the 15K level, adhered precisely to this parallel channel.
 As a result, the likelihood of a complex correction occurring is considerably high.
 

Based on these observations, I have constructed this particular scenario. It is an illustrative representation of potential market behavior, grounded in established technical principles. Wishing you all the best of luck.

 
 This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
 It is a personal perspective and should be used for reference only.
 All decisions and responsibilities lie with you.
Page 10, Article 13: Hello, Guysüòâ

Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive right into the main content.

-

In short, I believe Bitcoin is positioned for a price increase.

I‚Äôll explain this outlook through three key arguments,

starting with the first one.

-

‚úÖ  Reason 1.   

I‚Äôve applied the Bollinger Bands to Bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart.

Currently, the price is rebounding after touching the lower band.

Support and resistance often occur at the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands.

In this case, the price first hit the upper band, followed by a touch of the lower band‚Äîtypically a precursor to a rebound.

Let‚Äôs verify this with some historical examples.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

This is the chart from January 2024.

At that time, the price followed a similar pattern, first hitting the upper band, then touching the lower band.

Following this, the price rebounded sharply and eventually hit a new "All-time high".


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, take a look at this chart from February 2023.

Once again, the price touched the upper band, followed by the lower band, and we saw four consecutive green candles afterward, leading to a significant rally.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 3. 

This is the chart from February 2022.

Despite a prevailing downtrend, we witnessed a technical bounce after the price touched the upper band and then dropped to the lower band.

A significant rebound followed, even in the midst of bearish market conditions.

Now, let‚Äôs shift back to the current chart.

----------

‚úÖ  Reason 2. 

Next, let's take a look at the rising channel formed by three critical points.

I find this channel quite interesting.

 When focusing on the Half Line, it has consistently provided clear support and resistance levels.

Recently, we saw the price being rejected at this channel, which further reinforces its reliability.

However, the price has currently broken below the channel.

If it manages to rebound and reenter, we could witness a significant upward movement.

This pattern is commonly referred to as a "Trap," a frequent occurrence in technical analysis.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

This is the chart from December 2023.

We had a rising channel based on three key points. 

After a sharp drop, the price broke below the channel but quickly recovered, forming a "Trap" pattern before rising to the opposite end of the channel.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, take a look at the chart from March 2024.

Once again, we see a rising channel formed by three key points.

After ten consecutive green candles, the price hit a peak and dropped.

Despite breaking below the channel, the price quickly recovered, forming another "Trap" pattern and continued to rise, holding the middle line of the channel.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 3. 

Here‚Äôs a chart from November 2023.

This rising channel was formed by connecting the lower trendline and the peak.

After a price drop, the price broke below the lower trendline, forcing many retail investors to exit their positions.

However, the price soon rebounded and eventually broke out of the channel to the upside.

This time, the "Trap" pattern appeared twice, triggering multiple exits from the market.


‚úÖ  Reason 3. 

The third reason involves the  "3 Market Phases"  pattern.

This pattern typically unfolds in three distinct stages: Contraction, Expansion, and Profit Taking.

 
 First, Contraction occurs, which stabilizes the price range and makes investors feel comfortable.
 Next, the Expansion phase kicks in, causing volatility and confusion, often leading investors to get stopped out.
 Finally, the Profit Taking phase occurs, sparking a "FOMO" (fear of missing out) sentiment among investors as the price moves rapidly.
 

This pattern is often leveraged by market manipulators to shake out retail investors before a larger price movement.

Let‚Äôs take a look at some past examples to see this in action.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 1. 

Here‚Äôs the chart from January 2024.

It showcases a textbook example of the 3 Market Phases:

Contraction stabilized the price range,
Expansion created volatility and confusion,
and Profit Taking resulted in a strong uptrend.


‚úîÔ∏è Example 2. 

Now, here‚Äôs the chart from June 2023.

Again, we see a classic case of the 3 Market Phases pattern.

During the Expansion phase, the price breached both the upper and lower bounds, forcing retail investors to stop out. This was followed by a strong directional trend.

-

‚úÖ   

 
 First reason: Bollinger Bands
 Second reason: The Channel
 Third reason: 3 Market Phases
 

-

Now, for the final conclusion of today‚Äôs post

 I am anticipating a significant upward move. 

As long as the three reasons mentioned today remain valid, I remain confident in this bullish setup.

This is a historically high-probability scenario, and  I personally plan to take a "long position." 

Thank you for reading, and if you found this analysis helpful, please consider giving it a boost and following me for future updates.

Page 10, Article 14: Bitcoin is positioned to break through the $60,000 resistance, supported by bullish momentum and strong technical indicators. A sustained move above this level could propel the price to $63,000, with the 0.618 Fibonacci level providing solid support around $55,300 in case of a pullback.

Page 10, Article 19: üì£ Kazuo Ueda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, announced that if the economy and inflation progress as expected, the bank will continue raising interest rates. In a statement to a government panel led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, he noted that the economic environment remains favorable, and adjusted interest rates for inflation remain negative, even after the main rate hike in late July. This increase, the first in decades, led to the unwinding of yen carry trades and volatility in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

üìä Market Impact:
Ueda's comments increased demand for the yen, bringing the USD/JPY exchange rate down from 147 to 145.85. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures dropped by 0.5%, and Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell by 0.4%. The Bank of Japan's tightening policy contrasts with expectations of rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, which could further strengthen the yen against other currencies.

üåç Global Ripple Effects:
This scenario may force traders to sell risky investments and repay yen-denominated loans, impacting global markets.

üí° Yen Carry Trade Unwind:
The unwinding of yen carry trades, a strategy of borrowing yen and investing in higher-yielding assets, has already disrupted markets, contributing to Bitcoin's decline from $70,000 to $50,000 in the past month. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, warned that the continued unwinding of these trades could destabilize markets unless central banks increase money supply by expanding their balance sheets. Japan's long-standing low-interest policy had fueled widespread yen carry trades, with the Japanese government involved in around $20 trillion of such trades as of last October, according to Deutsche Bank.

Page 10, Article 21: The Cumulative Volume Delta Divergence is an indicator that helps traders visually assess the buying and selling pressures in the market by analyzing volume divergences over time. This indicator overlays directly on the price chart, offering insights into how volume shifts correlate with price movements.

Utility and Trading Benefit
Divergence Detection
The primary utility of this indicator lies in its ability to detect divergences between volume trends and price movements. Such divergences can signal potential price reversals, providing traders with early warnings about shifts in market sentiment.
Enhanced Decision Making
By integrating volume analysis directly with price action on the chart, the indicator aids traders in making more informed decisions regarding entry and exit points. This can be crucial for capitalizing on trends or avoiding potential losses.

Now the mother of all of coins is showing some strength again. Weekly data metrics is shifting now and buyers are back again, positioning aggressively for the next RUN-UP to ATH and beyond.

From our weekly chart diagram above, you can observe that the black bear cells has faded and the white dot (longs) has literally escaped the shorts prison cell (black cell). This signal has never  missed since the 15k BTC season. The batting average of this one playing out again is very very high.

This week is the best time to SEED. Get them all planted now. BTC is already up by 10% after that quick bounce from the strong major order support at 57k area. Signs of what's coming next after this week.

Page 11, Article 7: BINANCE:BTCUSDT  is moving downward toward the bottom of the consolidation zone. For context, the market has been oscillating between the 52K and 72K levels since April. Currently, I believe the market may retest the bottom of this zone, especially after it broke and closed below the psychological level at 60K. On the weekly timeframe, we have also broken and closed below the previous week's low, forming a large bearish candle. As a result, I expect the continuation of this bearish momentum. My target is support level 54000.

Page 11, Article 8: We retested our long POI on very strong momentum caused by SPX flow.

We could look for shorts at a sweep of our local highs around 58.1k, but I'd expect it to overshoot and give us 59.1 or the 59.8-60.6 zone where value got capped a few times in the past weeks.

I'm still not ruling out new lows, but the reaction at this 60k zone will be important to monitor and determine the next few weeks of price action possibly.

Page 11, Article 12: Bitcoin's looking bearish short-term. Key supports to watch: 54,800 and the CME gap at 54,000. I expect a bullish reversal around 53,500-54,000. Resistance is strong at 58,000 and 59,000. My take: we'll see a dip before any upward movement.

Page 11, Article 16: Dated today,  PHEMEX:BTCUSDT.P   had dropped 33% from it's All-time High $73851 at 14th March 2024. Despite the overall bearish sentiment in the market, Bitcoin's recent creation of a Higher Low $52500 at 6th September suggests a potential bullish reversal.

Today, we will delve into how the price of BTC might move in the next few days.

 1. Bullish Breakout.  
If Bitcoin can break above its previous high near $65,000, it would signal a strong bullish reversal. Following this, a period of accumulation might occur, to accumulate more buying power before a push towards the next resistance level around $72,000.

 2. Bearish Drop.  
Alternatively, Bitcoin could continue its downward trend, potentially retesting support levels at $50,000 and $41,900. To assess whether these levels offer buying opportunities, consider the trading volume and Relative Strength Index (RSI) during the decline.If the trading volume is lower than it was on August 5th and the RSI is higher, $50,000 might be a good price to buy the dip. However, if the volume is higher and the RSI is lower, $41,900 could be a better choice for buying low.

 3. Consolidation.  
Given the recent volatility, a period of consolidation between $65,000 and $52,500 is possible. This scenario might present opportunities for traders to employ Phemex Neutral Grid bots to profit from price fluctuations.

 Conclusion 
Bitcoin's price action suggests a potential bullish reversal. However, it's important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and technical analysis should be used in conjunction with other factors when making trading decisions. By carefully analyzing the technical indicators and considering potential scenarios, traders can develop informed strategies to navigate the market.

Page 12, Article 5: Hello traders and investors! 

For a month, I followed the previous analysis. Now, I‚Äôve decided to create a new one. Let me remind you of the setup. 
Quotes:
 On the 8-hour time frame, a sideways range has also formed. The lower boundary is at 53,485, and the upper boundary is at 71,997.
On the 2-hour timeframe, the seller's vector 8-9 has reached the target of 56078. The volume and delta are conducive to gathering stop losses below the level. The quick recovery by the buyer after the breakout and the candle closing above 56078 increase the likelihood of the price dropping below the local low of 55606. For the buyer's range vector 9-10 to play out (with a potential target of 62745), it would be prudent to accumulate volume and push the price below the local low of 55606. 

In fact, the price followed the assumptions. What‚Äôs next? 

On the daily and 8-hour timeframes, the buyer absorbed the seller's candle and formed a buyer's zone. At the same time, on the 8-hour timeframe, the seller touched the lower boundary of the range at 53,485, from where the buyer resumed. 


On the 2-hour timeframe, the seller manipulated the level of the beginning of the buyer's last impulse (56,078) at point 7 of the range. The price is currently above this level. 


All these factors favor searching for buy opportunities. 

I f the buyer defends 56,078 , potential targets are 
 
 58,519, 59,005, and 62,745, 65000 on the 2-hour timeframe, 
 61,166, 62,198, and 70,079 on the 8-hour timeframe, 
 and 61,166, 62,745, 70,079, and 72,797 on the daily timeframe.
 

Good luck with your trading and investments!

Page 12, Article 16: #Bitcoin Update ‚Äì Wednesday, 11.09.2024

Assalamu Alaikum and good evening to all brothers and sisters,

#Bitcoin has closed the daily candle above our key resistance level marked by the black line on the daily time frame. However, today‚Äôs session has been somewhat bearish. On the 4-hour chart, we can observe that the price has just retested the support line (as shown by the black circle). In my opinion, the price still remains bullish.

What‚Äôs next?
If the price continues to hold within the current resistance zone and stays above support, the bullish trend could remain intact. However, if it breaks below the support level, we may see a reversal in the trend.

#ALTS Update
The altcoin market has shown mixed signals today. While some altcoins are performing well, others have experienced significant drops in line with Bitcoin‚Äôs pullback. Nonetheless, all of our signals in the group are performing well, Alhamdulillah.

I wish you all a very pleasant day ahead! Stay informed and trade wisely.
Page 12, Article 17: POSSIBLE MOVE UNTIL FEB NEXT YEAR

 In January 2024, BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, launched two spot Bitcoin ETFs ‚Äì the BlackRock Bitcoin Trust and the BlackRock Bitcoin Private Trust. These funds offer institutional and individual investors regulated access to Bitcoin, marking a significant milestone for BlackRock in the crypto space. With over $8 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock‚Äôs entry was seen as a major endorsement of Bitcoin and a sign of growing institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have garnered over $60 billion in assets under management (AUM) so far.

If the stars align, or more accurately, if the charts, whales, and market dynamics align, Bitcoin might indeed be setting its coordinates for the $40,000s.

Here's to hoping your digital wallets are ready for the ride, whether it's to the moon or just a scenic tour around the current orbit.

#BitcoinTo40k #CryptoVoyage #MarketStructure #WhaleWatching
Page 12, Article 19: $BITSTAMP:BTCUSD. Should we be worried or be exited about the price action of #Bitcoin. Looking at the price action of BTC we  can see that there is a lot going on in the market and some traders are really worried about the next move for Bitcoin. So looking at the current price action, we can clearly see that Bitcoin is forming a falling wedge pattern which is a bullish continuation patten, also if we look at the current price level of 53k, we can see that price has been experiencing some rejections at this area. If Bitcoin should bounce off from this price zone, we should see a retest of the 60k area but if fails and breaks below we should see a proper rejection from the 50k area.
Now the question is should we be worried about the 40k which stands as demand zone  which we could definitely see Bitcoin retest that area if it fails to hold support around the 50k level. looking at the price action and the fundamental activities like CPI, UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM  and many more, we should probably expect some huge volatility which either push the price down to 50k or up to 60k levels respectfully.  My suggestion to any who want to invest in Bitcoin or any other Cryptocurrency is for them to wait for proper rejection and support for Bitcoin.

**On the Monthly timeframe,**  ,  bearish divergence on the WaveTrend is spotted. even when Using another indicator like the RSI or MACD it will reveals the same divergence. This downward pressure is reflected in the current price action. The Fibonacci retracement from the last Higher Low to the Higher High gives us levels that are often respected; the first orderblock has been mitigated and coincides with an old Monthly level, which triggered an upward reaction. The support line, aligned with the 50 EMA, is a "critical" level that could be tested. Losing this level could cause a drop towards the  GETTEX:25K , it may sound unrealistic but is quite possible, given similar moves in the past and the current macroeconomic times globally. Yes i know its a +60% from ath but go check nov ‚Äò21 till nov ‚Äò22. like Mark Twain would say:  "History does'nt repeat himself but it often rhymes"  my message would be that its something you should keep in mind, just in case. 

**On the Weekly timeframe**,  , the WaveTrend shows that once it moves into the negative, strong upward moves often follow. The Stoch RSI is at low levels, which may create buying pressure. Although volume remains low, but previous price increases have also occurred under low volume conditions. The price still seems to be moving within the broadening wedge, and the support line could be retested. The price targets of the broadening wedge and the potential cup & handle formation are close to each other, though the volume for the cup isn't ideal, but I still want to consider the formation.

**On the Daily timeframe, **https://www.tradingview.com/x/SwOlrpl9 , after the All-Time High (ATH), a clear Change of Character (ChoCh) is visible, with lower highs and lower lows confirming the downtrend.

The previous two highs haven't been tapped yet, so I expect reactions at those levels.

**Conclusion:**

Indicators like the WaveTrend and Stoch RSI suggest that a reversal is possible, but I still expect the lower support level to be tested as well. be Looking for the break of this downward trend‚Äîthink of an upward break in structure by printing higher highs and higher lows.

Page 12, Article 21: #Bitcoin Update | Saturday, 07.09.2024

Good Morning to All Brothers and Sisters,

#Bitcoin dropped as predicted in my last analysis, touching nearly all support levels. It found support at the bottom of our yellow area, and the working week closed there. Now, the key point is where the Sunday weekly candle will close. In my opinion, it's time for a trend reversal.

What's Next?

In my view, the price will likely remain within the FRD line until tomorrow. After that, we may see a retracement. If the price crosses the second resistance (blue and black lines), this will confirm the trend reversal. Otherwise, if the price breaks below the yellow area, it could drop further.

#ALTS

There has been significant bleeding in altcoins, but after Bitcoin breaks through the first resistance, I will start providing new signals on #ALTS. Make sure to activate your notifications and stay tuned.

Wishing you all a great weekend!

üëâ 58500$ Is Crucial Resistance Level And The BITCOIN Price Breakout From It By The Strong Green Candle And Currently We Are At The Mid Range Of a Main Bull Flag

üì• By The Yesterday Bounce Bulls Entered The Game And I Expect 67700$ As a Next Target And Major Resistance As a 1.272% PRZ

üîê The Important Point Is As Long As The Price Playing Above 57500$ Is Priority Is Bullish
Page 12, Article 23: In a previous analysis, I discussed the relationship between Bitcoin, the Altcoin market and Bitcoin Dominance. 


An important rotation exists between these three; and by using TOTAL3 together with BTC.D, you can get a clearer picture of where BTC is trading in the current cycle.


In this video, I make an important suggestion based off Elliot Wave Theory. This theory is backed up by the points mentioned but also by the Logarithmic view:


From the log scale, we can see BTC is still trading relatively low compared to previous cycle top-outs. So the question remains -  the end... or just the beginning?

Page 13, Article 1: Bitcoins has not been really moving above the range of  55k-62k  for a longer time now. Also Bitcoin broke below the crucial support at around  58k  and is currently getting rejected from it on the weekly chart.  I think the fed interest rate cut decision will be  extremely important  for Bitcoins midterm future. If the cut isn‚Äôt way higher than the expectations, Bitcoin will drop horribly. The decision could end the current bull market, furthermore because the strength of Bitcoin let loose a lot since the bit higher ATH.  Bitcoin could retrace to 32k-42k . But Bitcoin could also break above the lying above resistances and continue the Bullrun that could finish at  120k in April 2025 .

 Bullrun continuation probability: 60%
Bullrun ending probability 40%

In the same idea I had shared and I talk about the need to be patient right now as we potentially have over-speculation causing tight choppy waves. We need to let the chart speak to us and right now it's not saying anything.
Page 13, Article 4: If BTC has truly found it's bottom, this structure could be the start of a 5 wave elliot wave structure.

Interesting thing shows confluence with the end to a bullish trend towards the end of November before we have a correction.
Page 13, Article 5: If Bitcoin can break the middle line of the channel upwards, then it can be expected to break out of the channel for the first time.

Please note, this analysis is in a 4-hour time frame, and in higher time frames (1 day) stabilization should be done.

Currently, the market shows a greater desire for the price to be stable and not to fall further.
Page 13, Article 6: BTCUSD have been moving on a falling wedge we have a breakouts and retest and now i want to see the price closes above 58k today then more of swing  is expected till we arrive 65k.

Page 13, Article 7: Real traders know that we never say never. These are real levels with many touch points of data that we want to use when looking left. Its possible we come down to 30 k or lower. I know im going to get heckled by the moonboys. "oh bro jus hodl. 1 billion dollar btc programmed bro" uh no little timmy. Btc and crypto need to stitch together real levels of support and put in a base before any real movement higher. 
Just remember dont get cocky kid. It can crash harder and can soar higher thn any other asset . its completely tied to liquidity and rn. Things look bad in the markets on a global scale. A time will come when we go to new highs, but rn its not. I do prefer the gold chart as it paints the real picture. Bitcoin has set in a lower high against gold. I would pay attention to that chart as well.
Crypto is all momentum. remember that. both to the up and down
Page 13, Article 8: This weakly candle is very very very important, there is a scenario that btc is registering higher low in Daily timeframe to push up price, but we should have a look on interest rates cut, its not time to be panic, the market is full of fear, dont sell your BTC to BIG GAME PLAYERS.

Page 13, Article 9: Btc correction in weekly  and ready for heavy Pump üöÄüöÄ
Page 13, Article 10: Unfortunately, despite having a bullish divergence in 4H timeframe and reaching the support zone of 54,600 - 56,100, #BTC didn't show the small pump that was expected! there's probably an underlying reason for this that we don't know yet but  maybe something is going to take place in the coming days!

Anyways, since the bullish divergence didn't work and BTC crossed below the lower trendline and the mentioned support zone in one big candle, it can be said that the sell pressure is indeed strong. The main scenario is that any upward move towards the mentioned area which is now a resistance is considered a retest and Sell/Short strategy should be applied. Secondary scenario is crossing above the resistance zone which isn't very likely at the moment.

As it's been stated over and over for the past few weeks, the overall trend/sentiment is indeed bearish and BTC is most probably heading for 45,000 and then 42,000 zones!
Page 13, Article 11: On a smaller timeframe, Bitcoin is now at the major EMA line, where this is the last zone to get the rejection from.

If everything plays just like we need, we should see a nice rejection from here.

The other scenario would be breaking from 200EMA and forming yet another fakeout like we had before (which would also touch 200EMA on the bigger timeframe of Daily).

Last week Bitcoin went a little more up and then dropped just like I've said in my outlook.

üéØThis could potentially lead to the following targets:
üîªTarget 1: 54841.57
üîªüîªTarget 2: 52381.30
üîªüîªüîªTarget 3: 50096.10

‚ùåThe head and shoulders channel itself provides us with the stop-loss for the bearish scenario:

üëâIf BITCOIN rallies and sees a price above the previous high (59809.65), the stop-loss for the bearish scenario will be activated, and the analysis will need to be revisitedüîÑ
Page 13, Article 16: Hi there,

BTCUSDT appears bearish on the H1 chart, indicating a bias of 54001.88 below 55825.34. The nearest support line is at 54862.55.

If the price breaks above 57666.36, the setup will be considered invalid.

Page 13, Article 18: Hello, this is full-time investor full_time_trader88.

Here‚Äôs a Bitcoin update for September 6.

Let‚Äôs dive right in without further delay.




 (Trendline Perspective)

‚ö´Ô∏è Downtrend Line 

On the Bitcoin chart, we have a well-defined downtrend line that has been touched five times.

Typically, trendlines break after three or four touches, so seeing a 5th touch is relatively rare. 
This indicates that the trendline is well-established and has acted as a reliable resistance each time it was tested.

Therefore, whether or not Bitcoin breaks through this trendline will be a crucial development.





 (Horizontal Perspective)

‚ö´Ô∏è Resistance Level: $57,247 

There has been persistent resistance at this level.

When viewed broadly, it's a 3-touch resistance, but if we zoom in, it becomes more like 7 touches,

making this level extremely important in the short term.

 ‚ö´Ô∏è Support Zone: $55,422‚Äì$55,620 

This range has consistently acted as support.

At this point, we can see that Bitcoin is locked in a battle between this key resistance level and the underlying support zone.





Here‚Äôs a look at the combined picture, taking into account both the trendline and horizontal levels.






 (Divergence Perspective)

üîµ Accumulating Divergence 

On the 4-hour Bitcoin chart, we can see a buildup of bullish divergence.

Although divergence has been accumulating steadily, I believe it hasn't fully played out yet.

This suggests Bitcoin may be gathering strength for a potential move higher.

(In the worst case, it may never trigger. Divergences don‚Äôt always result in immediate action just because they‚Äôve formed.)





 (Daily Chart Perspective)

üî¥ Daily Bollinger Bands 

For the past 10 days, Bitcoin has struggled to break above the midline of the daily Bollinger Bands. 

It has tested this level around four times but has consistently faced strong resistance.

Ideally, we‚Äôd like to see the current bullish divergence give Bitcoin the momentum to break above the midline of the Bollinger Bands.





 (Channel Perspective)

üü† Downward Channel 

Bitcoin has been trading within a downward channel for the last 8 days, with a gradual decline.

While this slow downward movement has occurred, bullish divergence has been steadily accumulating, as mentioned earlier.

Currently, Bitcoin is holding at the lower boundary of the channel.

I personally expect an upward move from here soon (Though this is just my own analysis).





 (Fibonacci Perspective)

üü¢ Fibonacci 0.618 Level (54.5K) 

This is the Fibonacci retracement level connecting the August low and August high.

The key 0.618 level points to 54.5K.

However, 54.5K is not just an important level from a Fibonacci perspective. It‚Äôs also the exact point where the large bullish candle formed in early August.

Therefore, in my analysis, the 54.5K level is highly significant.

As long as 54.5K holds above this level, I will maintain my bullish outlook.




 Conclusion (3-Point Summary): 

1. Bullish divergence is steadily accumulating on the 4-hour Bitcoin chart.

2. The 54.5K level remains critical in my analysis.

3. As long as 54.5K holds, I will maintain a bullish perspective.


This is a simple summary of my thoughts.

Page 13, Article 19: üîªüîªFor the price to continue its decline towards the first target (50096.10-52489.40), the daily candle must close below 55606.00‚úÖ

‚ÄºÔ∏èTarget 1 aligns well with the bottom of the weekly bearish channel, and there is potential for a bearish divergence confirmation at this support zone if the price declines.

üôÖTherefore, we consider Target 1 as the maximum drop potential. There is a high probability of a bottom forming and an bull-trend starting from this area‚úÖüöÄ

üîªüîªüîªHowever, if the divergence is negated, meaning the MACD forms a lower low, Bitcoin could continue its decline towards Target 2 (41218.20)üòê

The conditions for a rally from this area (before closing below 55606.00) will be further analyzed on lower timeframesüëáüëáüëá
.............................
üíé#Bitcoin / ‚è±1h time-frame

üîª‚úÖAs long as we remain below the 15-minute bearish trend-line and today's resistance at 57365.30, there is a tendency for the price to continue its decline towards the aforementioned target (see figure)‚úÖüîª

‚ö†Ô∏èHowever, if the stop-loss for the current bearish scenario is triggered (a breakout of the 15-minute bearish trend-line and today's resistance):

üöÄWe can expect a temporary rally to the targets of 59124.60-59661.30, and ultimately 62121.60üéØ‚è±

‚ò†Ô∏èIt is predicted that, after reaching these upward targets, the price will then decline towards the main target‚ÄºÔ∏è

Page 13, Article 21: A great deal of viewers have contacted me asking how I "time" the market. In other words, once I've identified a market as "set up" (via COT strategy or Valuation Strategy), how do I get into a trade.

This video is the first in a series that will outline the entry techniques that I use.
 
18 PERIOD MOVING AVERAGE ENTRY METHOD: 

By far, this method is the safest change of trend confirmation that you will find. There are other entry techniques that will get you into the market sooner, sure. But those other entry techniques come with greater risk, and could be called "bottom picking" to some degree. 

The 18 Period MA Entry Method is simple.

 STEP 1:  Plot the 18 period SMA on your chart based on the closing price.

 STEP 2:  For  LONGS , you need to see two full range candles form  ABOVE  the MA. From there, mark out the highest high of those 2 candles. When price trades up into that high, the trend has officially changed to bullish. For  SHORTS , you need to see to full range candles form  BELOW  the MA. From there, mark out the lowest low of those 2 candles. When price trades down into that low, the trend has officially changed to bearish. 

 CAVEAT:  We  do not count inside bars  (bars that form within the range of the previous candle). If you see inside bars, skip them and continue your 2 bar count.

 STEP 3:  Enter at market when high/low is breached. Risk management is something I will review in another video, but generally, I add/subtract 120%-150% of the 3 bar ATR.

 CLARIFICATION:  To be clear, this entry technique should not be traded blindly.  You need to have a REASON to take the trade  (for example, COT strategy suggests a market is setup for a trade, or the Valuation/Ducks in a Barrel setup suggests a market is setup for a trade). 

 CREDIT:  I credit Larry Williams, Tom DeMark, Brian Schad & Jake Bernstein for their influence in these ideas.

If you have any questions about this entry technique, feel free to shoot me a message.

Good Luck & Good Trading.
Page 13, Article 22: Technical Analysis: 

 1. Price Rebound and Market Structure: 
 
 The price action shows a clear bullish rebound within a significant demand zone, aligning with the 61.8% - 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels of the previous bullish impulse. This area has historically acted as a strong support, and the current price movement suggests a potential continuation to the upside.
 The overall market structure remains bullish, as confirmed by the recent break of structure (BOS), indicating that buyers are still in control of the trend.
 

 2. Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs): 
 
 The EMAs are aligned favorably for a bullish continuation, acting as dynamic support for the price. The price has consistently bounced from these EMAs, suggesting that they remain critical for the continuation of the uptrend.
 As long as the price holds above the EMAs, the bullish structure remains intact, and the trend is likely to extend further.
 

 3. Momentum and Hidden Bullish Divergence: 
 
 A hidden bullish divergence is evident on the momentum indicator, indicating that while momentum has decreased slightly, price action remains strong. This suggests a continuation signal despite the temporary slowdown in momentum.
 Additionally, there is a potential bullish crossover forming, which could act as another signal for upward movement. This confluence of signals points towards further gains in the near term.
 

 4. Key Levels and Fibonacci Zones: 
 
 The Fibonacci retracement zones (61.8% and 78.6%) are crucial levels where price has found support. As long as these levels hold, the probability of a move towards new highs increases.
 Potential upside targets include previous resistance levels near $85,000 and further towards $92,000 if the bullish scenario plays out.
 

 5. Conclusion: 
 
 With strong support from EMAs, bullish market structure, and key Fibonacci levels acting as support, the outlook for BTC/USDT remains bullish. Momentum indicators also suggest that this trend is likely to continue.
 Traders should keep an eye on potential breakouts from resistance levels, with possible targets at $85,000 and $92,000. However, should the price fall below the current support levels, a reevaluation of the trend would be necessary.

Page 14, Article 5: Why could Bitcoin easily and quickly reach $100,000 if it breaks out of this sideways trend upwards? But...
 
Using various services like coinglass, it's possible to analyze different metrics, such as the liquidation map.

 What is this and why is it important? 
Liquidations are liquidity, and as we well know, the price moves from liquidity to liquidity. I'm sure you've often noticed how, after sharp and significant drops, the price quickly reacts and reverses. This is the moment when the price finds liquidity through the liquidation of a large number of market participants. In simple terms, it's like a magnet that will eventually attract the price.

 What do we see right now?  According to coinglass, at the $70,000 level alone, there are $20 billion worth of liquidation orders, and the same amount just slightly higher, at $71,500. These are potential liquidations of short-sellers (those betting on the market going down).

  

 What happens when short-sellers are liquidated?  When a short position is liquidated, a buy order is triggered automatically, which in turn pushes the price higher.

This long accumulation + liquidations can easily push the price up to $100,000 or even higher! And this could set the market trend direction for the next 4-6 months.

 But...
 
If you've read the previous post, you know that the current trend is bearish (downward), and until that changes, a further decline is more likely. Importantly, according to coinglass, there‚Äôs a lack of liquidity below, all the way down to the $44,000 - $42,000 range, with a large pool of liquidity and liquidations at the $33,000 level. And where there is no liquidity and it's empty, there are no barriers, meaning the price could drop just as rapidly.

 Additional thoughts: 
 
As long as the downward trend continues, the probability of the price moving lower remains higher. However, since this downtrend has lasted for almost 200 days, there‚Äôs also a significant chance that the trend could reverse, and we could move upwards. So, we are currently in a rather interesting and uncertain spot, where the likelihood of going up or down is about 50/50. I‚Äôll keep following my algorithmic trading systems!
Page 14, Article 6: In the ever-turbulent seas of the market, where every wave could be a treasure or a trap, there's an often overlooked strategy: doing absolutely nothing. Yes, you heard that right. Sometimes, the best action is inaction, or as traders like to call it, "sitting on your hands."

In the grand universe of trading, sitting on your hands isn't about doing nothing; it's strategic waiting. It's like being a cosmic sniper, waiting for that perfect shot where the probability of success is overwhelmingly in your favor. So, embrace the wait, enjoy the pause, and when the market structure shifts in a way that aligns with your strategy, then you make your move. Until then, keep your hands warm and your wit sharp.

Page 14, Article 12: I would love for Btc to take out Weekly liquidity and get everybody bullish before the real bloodbath begins
Page 14, Article 13: wxy-abc-wxy corrective waves are a lesser known waveform that should be familiar to the og Elliot wave traders from the 2000s. The current chart of BTC is following the same Elliot counts as the charts of SPX and NDX from 2009-2011. 
Often times, hedge fund trading algorithms 'map out' price patterns following these waveforms and if this is correct, the wxy pattern should end soon, and the final y leg has likely started or is about to start. 
If this is true, the bottom should be below 49k, and as per my OB analysis, this lies between 41k to 43k.
Page 14, Article 14: Last weeks high: $59,829.20 
Last weeks low: $52,551.34 
Midpoint: $56,190.27

More sell-off last week in the crypto markets, very tough market conditions continue, hitting the $52,000 bullish OB+ again, the first time being exactly one month before.
This area had held as support previously but it needs to hold this time around too, failing that $50,000 is the bottom of the daily downtrend channel. 

US CPI (Wednesday) & PPI (Thursday) this week, as with big news events we can potentially see volatility, this will be the last US CPI before rate cuts begin in the US, in Europe rate cuts are forecast to begin on Thursday, predicted to drop from 4.25% to 3.65% according to invesing.com, a 60bps cut.

Another major news event this week is the Trump v Harris Presidential debate. I'm not expecting a whole lot of crypto talk in this debate, if I'm being completely honest I can't see it being an adult debate about political policy at all. However, I do think it will have an effect on the markets one way or another, obviously Trump is the better outcome for crypto if he stays true to his plans set out during the Bitcoin conference compared to the plans for the Harris administration to tax un-realized gains which is not very pro-investment. Again, I'm not holding my breath for any information on crypto but it is a major news event all the same.

So in conclusion this week is full of news events that could create volatility, with BTC at its current level nearer the bottom of the daily trend. It does feel like we're maybe coming to an end of the chop with monetary policy pivot taking place soon.
Page 14, Article 15: This is it, how do you determine bearishness, when the bot you hope will hold is now your top you hope will break, in this case is 58300

This is even reinforced by the break of the major yellow trend which we now find an bear AADI, that is what I call support break resistance, exactly what we see here, A SUPPORT ON THE TRENDLINE, A BREAK OF IT, A REISTANCE ON IT. 

CETERIS PARIBUS THE MARKET SHOULD DROP FASTER THAN YOU CAN BUY. 

CONSIDER THAT TRENDLINE IS UPWARDS SO MORE PRESSURE ON BULLS TO KEEP UP

INVALIDATION IS SUPPORT ON 59400 AND A BREAK FROM THE BLUE DOWNWARD LINES THAT CAN EXPLODE BTC TO ATHs.

Sneak peak, notice the blue,red,yellow meetup point. Interesting.

Page 14, Article 17: In 1980, the Hunt brothers set off a financial earthquake, driving the price of silver from $6 an ounce to a jaw-dropping $50. At their peak, Nelson and William Hunt controlled over a third of the world‚Äôs privately owned silver, igniting a frenzy that reverberated throughout the financial world.

Their story began quietly in the early 1970s. With a vast oil fortune behind them, the Hunts grew increasingly concerned about rising inflation and a faltering U.S. dollar. They saw silver as a reliable investment that could safeguard their wealth and potentially yield enormous profits.

What started as cautious buying quickly escalated into a full-scale market takeover. From 1973 to 1979, the brothers amassed an astonishing 100 million ounces of silver. This massive accumulation sparked a rush among other investors, driving silver prices to unprecedented heights. By January 1980, silver had surged to nearly $50 an ounce, and the Hunts stood at the pinnacle of market power.

But their dominance was short-lived. As their influence grew, regulators took notice and introduced new rules and higher margin requirements. The Hunts, now heavily leveraged and unable to meet these new demands, faced a critical situation. On March 27, 1980‚ÄîSilver Thursday‚Äîthe market crashed, with silver prices plummeting by over 50% in a single day.

The aftermath was catastrophic. The Hunts were forced to liquidate their massive silver holdings, triggering a market panic that led to billions in losses. Once the kings of silver, the brothers found themselves bankrupt and disgraced, their audacious attempt to control the market ending in dramatic failure.

Many are forgetting that leverage in the crypto market remains high according to Glassnode On-chain analytic data. 
Hedge funds and leveraged funds still remain majority short, whereas retail traders have added to long positions according to the latest CME COT report. 
As retail traders remain overwhelmingly bullish, trying to long every single falling knife, real capitulation has yet to happen. 
Although we may get a small bounce in the short term, I think this will be minimal. We will likely see 48k in September and then 41k later in October/November. 
Expecting Q1 2025 to be bullish and ATH may be exceeded in mid-2025 which goes against current consensus.
Page 14, Article 21: Hello Traders! 
What are your thoughts on BITCOIN ?
Bitcoin has been in an upward trend in recent days, showing significant strength. However, the price is now approaching a key resistance zone that could potentially lead to a temporary correction.
Given this resistance, we anticipate a correction in this area. This correction could present an opportunity for traders to enter the market.
It is recommended that traders closely monitor this resistance zone and wait for the correction to complete before considering entry. Once the correction is over, we expect Bitcoin to resume its upward movement and potentially reach new highs.

Page 15, Article 1: Technical Analysis of the Chart by Bla≈æ Fabjan: 

 Descending Trading Channel: 

BTC is trading within a descending channel, showing lower highs and lower lows, which typically signals a downtrend. However, it is nearing the bottom of the channel, often a zone for potential reversal.

 Support and Resistance Zones: 

Support: The two orange zones indicate strong support areas around $51,000 and $50,000. BTC may find buying pressure in these regions, especially as it touches the lower bound of the descending channel.
Resistance: The current resistance area is around $55,000. BTC will need to break through this level to confirm a trend reversal.

 Indicators: 

RSI (Relative Strength Index): RSI is currently around 55, indicating a neutral trend. However, it is slightly moving upwards, suggesting potential bullish momentum, though not overbought yet.
Stochastic Oscillator: This is showing a crossover at 74, indicating upward momentum, but it‚Äôs close to the overbought region. This may signal some resistance to immediate bullish continuation.

VMC Cipher B Divergences: This indicator is showing bullish divergences at several points, signaling potential reversal zones. Divergence with price action suggests a potential trend change in the near term.

 Trading Plans: 

 1. Intraday Trading Plan: 
Strategy:
Trade within the current channel. Watch for a breakout from the descending channel, especially on the 1-hour chart.
A breakout above the $55,000 level could confirm a short-term bullish move.
Look for pullbacks towards the $53,500-$54,000 region to enter long positions, targeting $55,500.
Place a stop loss just below $53,000 to protect against fake breakouts.
Indicators to Watch:
RSI trending above 60.
Stochastic Oscillator maintaining bullish momentum.

 2. Scalping Strategy: 
Strategy:
Focus on small price fluctuations within the support and resistance zones.
Look for quick entries near the support zones (around $53,500) and exits before it hits resistance ($55,000).
Scalping in tight time frames (5 to 15 minutes) around these price levels.
Key Levels:
Enter around $53,500 and exit at $54,500.
Place tight stop-loss orders around $53,000 to manage risk.

 3. Swing Trading Strategy: 
Strategy:
If BTC continues trading within this descending channel, wait for a breakout confirmation to take a long position.
A breakout above the channel and $55,500 would signal a strong move upwards, potentially to $58,000 or higher.
Enter long positions if BTC breaks and holds above the $55,500 resistance level, targeting $58,000 and beyond.
In case of a further dip, enter long positions around $50,000 support, which appears to be a strong reversal point.
Stop Loss: Below $50,000.

 Conclusion and Long Position Advice: 

Near-Term (Intraday): BTC could break above the descending channel, leading to a short-term bullish move towards $55,500. Watch closely for a breakout confirmation. You could consider entering long positions on pullbacks or a confirmed breakout.

Medium-Term (Swing Trading): A solid break of the $55,500 resistance could lead to a potential rally towards $58,000. Be cautious of potential false breakouts and place stop-losses below support levels.

Scalping: For those aiming for quicker profits, you can take advantage of price fluctuations within the $53,500-$55,000 range.

Overall, the chart shows signs of a potential bullish reversal, especially if BTC breaks out of the descending channel. For now, conservative traders may wait for a breakout confirmation before entering long positions. However, aggressive traders can consider buying near support levels, keeping in mind the risk of downward movement in case of failure to break resistance.

Page 15, Article 4: Based on the analysis using the Algoman indicator, Bitcoin is moving within the $56K to  GETTEX:64K  range. Considering the formation of 4-hour order blocks, there is a high probability of a price interaction with the 4-hour order block around the  GETTEX:64K  zone.

Using inverted charts can be useful to avoid being too biased, and see things from a different prospective.

There's many bears out there that refuse to see a possible BTC bull flag/bullish consolidation.

I bet they won't hesitate to call this a bear flag ready to continue down.
There is a strong horizontal level being retested from beneath, and the price seems to be rejecting.
There is no major higher high, and the price is still capped below the trendline.
Everything points to bearish continuation.

Back to regular chart, it goes without saying, if BTC breaks that trendline and makes new lower low, it would be very, very bearish. For real.

Good luck everyone!

It's totally new for all of you only
Page 15, Article 8: Macro Overview

Easier withdrawal options have kept Bitcoin balances on exchanges stable, signaling investor hesitation near key levels. Miner transfers to exchanges have hit their lowest point of the year, while illiquid supply has increased, reflecting a lack of selling intent. Investors in ARKB are leading the way in spot Bitcoin ETF purchases.

Technical Analysis

BTCUSD corrected to 55,650 before retesting 57,800. The price remains within an upward channel and above both EMAs, indicating continued bullish momentum. If BTCUSD extends its rise beyond 57,800, it may retest the psychological level of 60,000. On the other hand, if BTCUSD pulls back before continuing upward, it may correct to around 56,500.
Page 15, Article 9: When the BTCUSDT daily chart is examined; It is observed that the price movements continue in a downward trend. It is evaluated that the crypto can target the 64835 level by passing the 59867 level in price movements above the 53657 level, but it is evaluated that it can retreat to the 43817 level by breaking the 49071 level in price movements below the 53657 level.
Page 15, Article 10: I think bulls want to keep grinding up here, or at least defend 56k region if we retest it.

Going below 55.5-56k, we have some untested npocs, but there is not a lot volume to support price there, so I would wait for 53.6k or 52.5 before considering being a buyer.

If bulls are successful and keep momentum going, I think 60-61k is going to be an interesting area to watch. It has proven to be a pivotal level, with almost no volume traded at 60k but decent HVN right above and right below it.

Page 15, Article 13: Bitcoin Update ‚Äì Monday, 09.09.2024

As-salamu alaykum and Good Morning to All Brothers and Sisters,

This past weekend, #Bitcoin made some impressive moves, but we are still below the first resistance level on the 4-hour timeframe. As the U.S. markets open today, there's a possibility that #Bitcoin could break through this initial resistance and move towards the second one. I've updated the support and resistance levels according to the recent dump, and these lines will help us track the market's next move.

What's Next?

If Bitcoin manages to break through these resistance levels, we could see a solid uptrend forming from this point. However, if it fails to do so, we might experience another pullback. At the moment, we're sitting at the bottom of our designated yellow area, which I believe could act as strong support for now. The price may hold in this zone, but it's crucial to watch closely as the day unfolds.

#Alts (Altcoins)

As I mentioned in my last analysis, I'm waiting for the first resistance breakout before giving any new buy signals for altcoins. Right now, the movement is uncertain, and it's best to remain cautious. I recommend waiting for today's candle to close before making any new entries. Insha‚ÄôAllah, once the market gives us a clearer direction, we can proceed accordingly.

I wish everyone a very profitable and successful week ahead. Stay patient and keep your eyes on the charts!
Page 15, Article 14: The price of Bitcoin is likely to return to around 58K and 60K and then fall again to 48K.
According to the picture, we also have 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci.
Page 15, Article 15: All indicators point to a continued decrease in the price of BTC. Funds are withdrawn from spot ETFs every day, and the mood on the market continues to be short. Looking at the graphs of altcoins, in most cases they are also aimed at continuing the fall. I think that we are in for a strong acceleration, after which a reversal and the beginning of growth is possible.

I consider the range for entering a long position in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã45000-47000

and comment if you want any analysis of any other coin or other markets..
Page 16, Article 1: The bullrun started in November 2022 - and has been increasing in price ever since.

It has been following the Fib Speed Resistance Fan along the .382 perfectly since then, only briefly dropping below, but never more than 7%... 

I would say, After nearly two years of following this, This is a fairly perfect "Floor" line to follow.

Between March and October 2023, We had 216 days of consolidation before a major pump to the upside, So far, Between March 2024 and today, we have had 191 days of consolidation, Leaving a rough estimate of 25 more days before we could get a major move to the upside (If history repeats)...

We are in a descending parallel channel, Bouncing off the bottom, Once again - Off the .382 Fib Speed fan... We have an Inverse H+S Forming, disguised cleverly, within this channel.

We have formed a beautiful Long term C+H, from the previous Bullrun cycle, with a handle down to  GETTEX:49K , giving us a target of $100k Bitcoin

Everything is bullish here, and it is screaming to let rip. But are you?

Page 16, Article 8: The "Market Direction" indicator combines four advanced sub-indicators to provide a comprehensive and multi-dimensional analysis of market trends, momentum, and potential reversals. This innovative approach leverages different aspects of price action, volume, and market sentiment, offering traders an in-depth view of market conditions.

 1. Fractal Indicator: Multi-Scale Price Action Analysis 
The Fractal Indicator identifies significant highs and lows over six different pivot lengths, offering a nuanced view of price action across multiple timeframes. By comparing distances from current closing prices to these key fractal points, the indicator determines potential trend reversals and market direction. This approach enables traders to adapt their strategies to various market conditions, capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

 2. Volume MACD Indicator: Enhanced Market Momentum 
The Volume MACD Indicator goes beyond traditional MACD analysis by incorporating volume-weighted movement and the structural attributes of candlesticks (such as body length and wicks). This hybrid model offers a more comprehensive understanding of market momentum by integrating both price action and trading volume. The use of Smoothed Moving Averages (SMMA) reduces noise and ensures more stable signals, helping traders focus on sustainable trends and longer-term investment opportunities.

 3. Cumulative Volume Momentum Indicator: Volume Dynamics Insight 
The Cumulative Volume Momentum Indicator evaluates the momentum of cumulative buying and selling volumes, offering a clear picture of market strength and potential reversals. By comparing the relationship between open, close, high, and low prices, and applying a MACD approach to these volume dynamics, this indicator helps traders identify momentum shifts that often precede price movements. The visualization through histograms adds clarity to bullish and bearish volume momentum, enhancing decision-making in volatile markets.

 4. POC-Price Momentum Indicator: Market Depth and Sentiment 
The POC-Price Momentum Indicator assesses the difference between the Point of Control (POC) and closing prices, providing insights into underlying market sentiment. Positive differences indicate a buildup of upward momentum, while negative differences suggest a bearish tilt. By calculating moving averages of these differences, the indicator highlights the strength and sustainability of ongoing trends, helping traders align their strategies with the broader market direction.

 Unified Rating for Confirming Market Direction 
The "Market Direction" indicator consolidates the outputs of these four sub-indicators into a single, aggregated sentiment score. This score helps traders confirm the prevailing market trend by weighing the combined insights from fractal analysis, volume momentum, price action, and POC dynamics. A positive score suggests a bullish market, while a negative score indicates bearish conditions.
Page 16, Article 9: Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase this September, with a Descending Broadening Wedge pattern forming on both the weekly and daily charts. This pattern typically signals potential volatility, and we are now approaching the descending support trendline, which also aligns with the wick from the sharp price dump on August 5th. This region, around 48K, is likely to be tested in the coming days as the market seeks to sweep liquidity.

 Key Support Zones to Watch:  
Crucial Support Zone 1: The first line of defense. If Bitcoin holds here, we could start seeing signs of bullish momentum returning.
Crucial Support Zone 2: A deeper level of support. Breaking below this zone could lead to a more extended bearish trend.

In the event that these levels are broken and confirmation bearish candles start forming, we could see Bitcoin testing 42K, 40K, and even 36K in the weeks ahead. However, if Bitcoin holds these zones and begins to print higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL), it would be an early sign that the downtrend might be over.

Also an important element in this setup is the 100-day EMA, which aligns perfectly with Crucial Support Zone 2. This adds a layer of confidence that the price may find strong support here. The confluence of the 100-day EMA with this key support level suggests that a touch of this zone could trigger the next major move, potentially kickstarting a rally.

 Strategy for Traders: 
Swing Traders/Spot Traders: Pay close attention to the support zones, as these levels could present excellent buying opportunities. A bounce from these areas might indicate the start of a new rally, so it‚Äôs time to prepare and fill your bags.

Scalpers: Be mindful of the resistance zones. The price may spike slightly before retesting lower levels, providing potential shorting opportunities. Watch closely for a "soft" or "hard" landing around 50K-48K.

 Caution: Bull Trap Alert 
If Bitcoin encounters a pump in the near term, be cautious about falling into a bull trap. All signs currently point to a retest of the 50K and 48K zones as highly probable, so don‚Äôt get caught up in premature optimism.

Also these are the results of my short trades, even though both the short setups hit SL ' closed 1 earlier' which is part of trading as we know it.
Page 16, Article 11: Hello everyone, let's look at the current BTC situation considering the one hour interval.  In this situation, we can see how the price has moved higher from the local downtrend line above which it remains.
  Let's start by setting goals for the near future, which include:
T1- 60252$
T2- 62340$
T3- 64922$
  Now let's move on to the stop-loss in case the market continues to decline:
  SL1 = $58,076
  SL2 = $56,190
  SL3 = $555,256 AND
  SL4 = $54,044

  Looking at the RSI indicator, we see a movement at the upper limit, which may influence an attempt to recover or give a temporary sideways trend.

Always remember I want you to win too.
Page 16, Article 15: Hello, this is Chartist.

Bitcoin has been in a continuous downtrend since reaching the $65,000 level, without any significant rebound. 

Currently, it has declined by around 19% from its previous high, forming a bottom around the $52,500 level.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has remained in the "extreme fear" range at 22-23 over the past two days, highlighting heightened market anxiety.

Now, the key question is whether Bitcoin can stage a rebound from this point. 

Based on the current technical indicators, I believe there is potential for a recovery.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the analysis.

 < Chart Analysis > 



I‚Äôve used RSI, CCI, and Stochastic indicators on this chart, and all three are showing positive signals after exiting oversold conditions.

1. RSI(Relative Strength Index) : An indicator measuring buying pressure. Currently recovering from oversold levels, signaling a possible price rebound.

2. CCI(Commodity Channel Index) : Used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. It‚Äôs moving out of the oversold zone, which indicates upward momentum.

3. Stochastic : A short-term indicator that predicts price reversals. It‚Äôs recovering from the oversold region, further suggesting the likelihood of a technical rebound.

Typically, when these indicators show recovery, the price tends to move toward the middle line of the Bollinger Bands (the red line on the chart). 

However, since this middle line could serve as resistance, it‚Äôs crucial to monitor how the price reacts upon reaching it.


 < Summary > 

- Bitcoin has dropped from $65,000, establishing a bottom around $52,500. 

- Technical indicators such as RSI, CCI, and Stochastic are all signaling recovery from oversold conditions, indicating a potential rebound. 

- It will be important to watch if the middle line of the Bollinger Bands acts as a resistance level during this rebound.

Best of luck with your investments!

‚Äª This is not a buy or sell recommendation.
‚Äª It is a personal perspective and should be used for reference only.
‚Äª All decisions and responsibilities are yours.
Page 16, Article 16: Btc has been in a downtrend, which moved into a parallel channel recently, Today it broke downwards out of that channel again, and continued along the downtrend trajectory.

However it has hit a point of consolidation, and now looks to be bouncing back up.

I predict we will come back up around $55k to retest the previous area of support, to confirm as resistance, therefore a quick scalp is on the table to the upside...

Always DYOR
Page 16, Article 17: Bitcoin Update:

BTC closed below  GETTEX:54K  on the daily chart, bringing the price close to the support trendline. As expected, BTC has made a bearish move.

What‚Äôs next?

The $50.6K support, or around $50K, must hold to help BTC rebound and rally. The RSI is attempting to form a bullish divergence; if successful, it could be positive for BTC.

For now, all eyes are on the support range between $50K and $52.5K.

Hope this helps. Trade safely.

Best regards,
Team Dexter

The black line stands for MA200.
The magenta line stands for EMA55.

MA200 is a slow moving moving average. 
EMA55 is a fast moving moving average, in comparison to MA200.

‚ûñ The bullish cross

When EMA55 moves above MA200 we have a bullish cross. This is a bullish signal.
Here it happened in January 2023 and October 2023, in both cases this signal preceded a major rise in prices.

‚ûñ The bearish cross

When EMA55 moves below MA200 we have a bearish cross. This is a bearish signal.
Here it happened recently, mid-August 2024. This signal points to a major decrease in prices.

These basic signals support all the more complex analyses I've been sharing.
