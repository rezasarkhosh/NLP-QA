# ðŸš€ Cryptocurrency Market Analysis and Question Answering System

This repository contains a project that scrapes cryptocurrency price analysis data from **TradingView**, processes the text using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for normalization, and implements a **Question-Answering (QA) system** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer questions about cryptocurrency trends, particularly focusing on **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Ethereum (ETH)**.

## Overview

This project automates the process of:
1. **Scraping** crypto market analysis articles from **TradingView** for BTC and ETH.
2. **Normalizing** the scraped textual data by cleaning it, removing unnecessary elements like emojis and stop words, and preparing it for further processing.
3. Building a **Question-Answering System** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, where users can ask questions about the future trends and market outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the system retrieves relevant articles and generates a detailed answer.


## Features

- **Real-Time Scraping**: Retrieves the latest cryptocurrency analysis articles from TradingView.
- **Text Normalization**: Cleans the raw data by removing emojis, stop words, and normalizing the text for consistent results.
- **Question Answering (RAG)**: Implements a question-answering system that retrieves relevant articles and generates human-like answers.
- **Multiple Models**: Leverages state-of-the-art models like `T5` for text generation and `FAISS` for document retrieval.

### Required Files

1. **`BTC_normalized.txt`** and **`ETH_normalized.txt`** should contain your cleaned and normalized data. 
2. If you don't have these files, the script will generate them through the scraping and normalization steps.

## Usage

### Web Scraping

The **scraping** component fetches market analysis data from TradingView for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Run the scraping script:

```bash
python scrapping.py
```

This will save raw market analysis data to:
- `data/BTC.txt`
- `data/ETH.txt`

### Text Normalization

To normalize the scraped data (remove stop words, emojis, etc.), run the text normalization script:

```bash
python textNormalization.py
```
The cleaned data will be saved in:
- `data/BTC_normalized.txt`
- `data/ETH_normalized.txt`

### Question Answering System (RAG)

To use the **Question Answering** system, which uses **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), run:

```bash
python indexing.py
```

Then you can query the model with questions like:

- "What is the market outlook for Bitcoin in 2024?"
- "What is the expected price of Ethereum after the elections?"

The model will return a detailed, generated answer based on the latest retrieved documents and data.

Example:

```bash
Q: What is the market outlook for Ethereum after the elections?
A: Ethereum might correct to the $2800-$3000 range due to market uncertainty following the elections, with potential short-term declines expected.
```
## Technologies Used

- **Web Scraping**: `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`
- **Natural Language Processing**: `nltk`, `spacy`, `regex`
- **Machine Learning Models**: `Hugging Face Transformers` (T5, BART), `Sentence-BERT`
- **Vector Search**: `FAISS` (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Text Generation**: `T5` (via `transformers` library)
- **Other Tools**: `pandas`, `numpy`

## Future Improvements

- **Fine-Tuning the Model**: Fine-tune the generative model on crypto-specific datasets to improve the relevance of generated answers.
- **Domain-Specific Models**: Implement financial or crypto-specific models like **FinBERT** for better performance.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Build a web interface using **Streamlit** or **Flask** to allow users to interact with the system in real-time.
- **Data Visualization**: Add visualizations for the trends and predictions generated by the system.
